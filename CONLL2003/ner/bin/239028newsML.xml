<p>Brazil will liberate prices for anhydrous alcohol in May 1997 and for hydrous alcohol at the start of May 1998, a Finance Ministry official said.</p>
<p>Luiz Milton Veloso Costa, assistant price sheriff, gave the information at a seminar on the ethanol industry in Sao Paulo, according to Carmen Machado, president of the sugar and alcohol council of Brazil's BM&amp;F futures and commodities exchange.</p>
<p>Alcohol prices were due to be liberated at the start of 1997 but last month, after coming under pressure from the industry, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce recommended a delay in the measure and continuation, for the time being, of subsidies.</p>
<p>Mauricio Assis, head of the ministry's primary commodities department, told the Sao Paulo seminar the government had made the move to help the industry adjust to free competition.</p>
<p>&quot;We had to delay the dates (for price liberation) to give the sector more time to adjust,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Assis said the government was still studying replacing subsidies with a &quot;green tax&quot; on less environmentally-friendly fuels. No decision had yet been made.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the government announced as part of a general liberalization of fuel prices the end to subsidies and price controls from the beginning of next year.</p>
<p>But ethanol distillers, accustomed to being bankrolled by the government under the two-decade-old Pro-Alcohol Campaign, said they needed more time to prepare themselves.</p>
