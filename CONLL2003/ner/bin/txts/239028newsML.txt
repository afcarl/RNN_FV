Brazil sets dates for liberalizing alcohol prices.

SAO PAULO 1996-12-06

Brazil will liberate prices for anhydrous alcohol in May 1997 and for hydrous alcohol at the start of May 1998, a Finance Ministry official said.

Luiz Milton Veloso Costa, assistant price sheriff, gave the information at a seminar on the ethanol industry in Sao Paulo, according to Carmen Machado, president of the sugar and alcohol council of Brazil's BM&F futures and commodities exchange.

Alcohol prices were due to be liberated at the start of 1997 but last month, after coming under pressure from the industry, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce recommended a delay in the measure and continuation, for the time being, of subsidies.

Mauricio Assis, head of the ministry's primary commodities department, told the Sao Paulo seminar the government had made the move to help the industry adjust to free competition.

"We had to delay the dates (for price liberation) to give the sector more time to adjust," he said.

Assis said the government was still studying replacing subsidies with a "green tax" on less environmentally-friendly fuels. No decision had yet been made.

Earlier this year, the government announced as part of a general liberalization of fuel prices the end to subsidies and price controls from the beginning of next year.

But ethanol distillers, accustomed to being bankrolled by the government under the two-decade-old Pro-Alcohol Campaign, said they needed more time to prepare themselves.
