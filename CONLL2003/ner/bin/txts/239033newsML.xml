<title>USA: ALPINE SKIING-WOMEN'S WORLD CUP DOUBLEHEADER SET FOR SATURDAY.</title>
<headline>ALPINE SKIING-WOMEN'S WORLD CUP DOUBLEHEADER SET FOR SATURDAY.</headline>
<dateline>VAIL, Colorado 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>A massive storm system sweeping though the Rocky Mountains forced postponement of a World Cup downhill race for women Friday, setting the stage for an unusual Saturday doubleheader.</p>
<p>In a World Cup rarity, the downhill race will begin at 9:30 a.m. (1630 gmt) and will be followed by the super-G originally scheduled for the same day.</p>
<p>The move is not unprecedented for Vail. Under similar circumstances, the resort held two women's World Cup super-G events in a single day in 1987. Since competitors must travel for a Thursday race at Val d'Isere, France, continuance on Sunday was not an option.</p>
<p>With poor visibility, 17 inches (43 cms) of fresh snow on the course and no indication of let up, officials made the decision just prior to Friday's scheduled start. Race officials are buoyed by an improved forecast for Saturday -- greatly improved visibility with scattered snow flurries.</p>
<p>The delay cast a further pall over an event already clouded by Wednesday's practice injury to American Picabo Street. The two-time World Cup downhill champion tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee and is out for the season.</p>
<p>Although several racers may be expected to compete well on the Vail course, the favourite is Katja Seizinger of Germany. Seizinger seems well on her way to defending her overall title and, with Street gone, perhaps regaining the downhill crown as well.</p>
<p>After winning the season's first downhill last weekend at Lake Louise, Canada, Seizinger again is atop the overall standings with 305 points. Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden, the most logical challenger, has 258 points and suddenly has emerged as a downhill contender as well.</p>
<p>&quot;My ambition this season is to win a downhill race,&quot; said Wiberg, who never has done so in an eight-year career that includes 11 victories in every other discipline. Moreover, she has been among the leaders in Vail training.</p>
<p>&quot;I like this course. We'll see if this is the race for me.&quot;</p>
<p>Those who have practiced well include Seizinger, Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria, Warwara Zelenskaja of Russia and American Hilary Lindh. Lindh, who now bears the U.S. team burden with Street's injury, won the most recent women's downhill at Vail in 1994.</p>
