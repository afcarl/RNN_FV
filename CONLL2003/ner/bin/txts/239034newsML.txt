Defending champion Goran Ivanisevic used his record-breaking serve to boost his earnings at the Grand Slam Cup to more than $3.2 million on Friday and move towards a semifinal clash with French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov.

The big-serving Croat, who before this year had earned $2.8 million in four appearances at the most lucrative event in the game, powered his way past Australian Mark Woodforde 6-4 6-4 in 66 minutes to add another $431,250 to his bank balance.

In Saturday's semifinals, the Croat takes on Russian Kafelnikov who reached the last four by beating former Australian Open champion Jim Courier 2-6 6-4 8-6 in the closest match of the tournament so far.

The match lastest just over two hours and was not decided until Kafelnikov hit a superb backhand down the line to break Courier's serve and take a 7-6 lead. The Russian then served out for the match in the next game.

In the other semifinal, Australian Open champion Boris Becker takes on Britain's surprise package Tim Henman.

The winners of Saturday's matches are guaranteed $812,500 and a shot at the winning prize of $1.625 million.

On the way to his victory, Ivanisevic took his total of aces for the year to a record of more than 1,500.

"Now I can say that I am the best server in the game," Ivanisevic said.

Woodforde added: "I have a lot of respect for that serve because he's able to serve incredibly well. That's probably one of tennis's phenomenons, Goran Ivanisevic's serve."

The best performers from the four grand slams -- Wimbledon and the U.S., French and Australian Opens -- qualify for the Cup.

Although he has twice been a runner-up at Wimbledon, Ivanisevic has never won a grand slam. But he has a good record at the Cup. In addition to last year's triumph the towering Croat player has reached the semifinals twice.

Ivanisevic's huge serve is a major asset on the fast indoor surface. It makes it very difficult for his opponents to get on top of his game, as Woodforde found out.

Woodforde had his own serve broken in the third game and Ivanisevic soon had the first set in 31 minutes. Another break in the first game of the second set effectively clinched his place in the semifinals.

The Croat did drop his serve in the eighth game but broke back immediately before finishing off the second set in 33 minutes.

Courier took the first set against Kafelnikov with relative ease. The American saved three set points in the second before the Russian forced a third set with an ace.

Both players made breaks of serve in the first four games of the third set. Courier seemed to be poised to clinch the match after he broke again to lead 5-3. But the Russian broke back in the next game to save the day.
