ALPINE SKIING-WOMEN'S DOWNHILL POSTPONED.

VAIL, Colorado 1996-12-06

Heavy snowfall forced postponement of a women's World Cup downhill on Friday.

The race is reset for Saturday, when it will be run immediately prior to the World Cup women's super-G originally scheduled for that day.

The move is not unprecedented for Vail World Cup events. Under similar circumstances, the resort held two women's super-G events on the same day in 1987.

With 17 inches (43 cms) of fresh snow on the course and no indication of let up, officials made the decision just prior to the scheduled start of the downhill.

Saturday's downhill is now scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. (1630 gmt) and the super-G at 1:30 p.m. (2030 gmt).
