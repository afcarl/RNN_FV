SOCCER-UZBEKISTAN ROCK CHINA WITH TWO LATE STRIKES.

AL-AIN, United Arab Emirates 1996-12-06

Newcomers Uzbekistan scored two late goals to earn a surprise 2-0 (0-0 halftime) win over China in their opening Group C match in the Asian Cup on Friday.

Igor Shkvyrin scored in the 78th minute and Oleg Shatskiku in the 90th to give the former Soviet republic victory.

Pouncing on a misdirected header by Chinese defender Wei Qun, Shkvyrin found the net, lobbing the ball over advancing keeper Ou Chuliang.

Shkvyrin looked on course to score a second three minutes later, but lost possession to Qun inside the area.

Shatskiku put the game out of China's reach in injury time, running across their defence and finishing with a left foot shot from just outside the area.

China came close to scoring in the 40th minute, but Peng Weiguo's free kick from 20 metres out went wide of the right post.

Uzbekistan also came close to chalking up a goal just before the halftime whistle, but China's defence cleared the ball after a goalmouth scramble.
