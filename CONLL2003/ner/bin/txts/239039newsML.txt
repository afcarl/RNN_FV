CRICKET-PAKISTAN BEAT NEW ZEALAND TO TAKE SERIES.

SIALKOT, Pakistan 1996-12-06

Pakistan took an unbeatable 2-0 lead over New Zealand in their three-match one-day series, winning the second game comfortably by 46 runs on Friday.

Chasing a formidable Pakistan total of 277 for 9 off 47 overs, the visitors were bowled out for 231 in 42.1 overs.

New Zealand faced an uphill task after losing openers Bryan Young and Craig Spearman in the first two overs. Wasim Akram, playing his 50th one-day game as captain, captured three for 43.

The Pakistani success followed a narrower 11-run victory in the first game at Gujranwala on Wednesday.

The 50-over game was reduced by three overs because of heavy overnight dew on the outfield.

Left-hander Stephen Fleming was top scorer for the touring side with an accomplished 88 off 95 balls.

He shared a second-wicket stand of 118 in 17.2 overs with Adam Parore, who contributed a crisp 37 off 45 balls, smacking Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmad for a six each as well as two fours.

New Zealand's effort faded as the required run rate climbed, especially after the departure of Fleming with the score on 170.

Earlier, a fine opening stand of 177 in 29 overs between Saeed Anwar and Zahoor Elahi had set Pakistan on their way.

Man-of-the-match Anwar made a magnificent 91, hitting 11 fours off 114 balls. Elahi hit 86, his highest one-day score.

Elahi, playing only his third game, smashed five sixes and seven fours in his whirlwind knock of 87 balls.

Anwar, who seemed set for his 12th one-day century, was brilliantly run out by Chris Harris who stopped a drive at square leg and then broke the stumps with a deadly throw.

The other major contributor was Ijaz Ahmad who made a vigorous 59 off 53 balls with two sixes and four fours.

Medium-pacer Harris finished with his best one-day figures of five for 42 as he sliced through Pakistan's middle order.
