<p>Pakistan took an unbeatable 2-0 lead over New Zealand in their three-match one-day series, winning the second game comfortably by 46 runs on Friday.</p>
<p>Chasing a formidable Pakistan total of 277 for 9 off 47 overs, the visitors were bowled out for 231 in 42.1 overs.</p>
<p>New Zealand faced an uphill task after losing openers Bryan Young and Craig Spearman in the first two overs. Wasim Akram, playing his 50th one-day game as captain, captured three for 43.</p>
<p>The Pakistani success followed a narrower 11-run victory in the first game at Gujranwala on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The 50-over game was reduced by three overs because of heavy overnight dew on the outfield.</p>
<p>Left-hander Stephen Fleming was top scorer for the touring side with an accomplished 88 off 95 balls.</p>
<p>He shared a second-wicket stand of 118 in 17.2 overs with Adam Parore, who contributed a crisp 37 off 45 balls, smacking Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmad for a six each as well as two fours.</p>
<p>New Zealand's effort faded as the required run rate climbed, especially after the departure of Fleming with the score on 170.</p>
<p>Earlier, a fine opening stand of 177 in 29 overs between Saeed Anwar and Zahoor Elahi had set Pakistan on their way.</p>
<p>Man-of-the-match Anwar made a magnificent 91, hitting 11 fours off 114 balls. Elahi hit 86, his highest one-day score.</p>
<p>Elahi, playing only his third game, smashed five sixes and seven fours in his whirlwind knock of 87 balls.</p>
<p>Anwar, who seemed set for his 12th one-day century, was brilliantly run out by Chris Harris who stopped a drive at square leg and then broke the stumps with a deadly throw.</p>
<p>The other major contributor was Ijaz Ahmad who made a vigorous 59 off 53 balls with two sixes and four fours.</p>
<p>Medium-pacer Harris finished with his best one-day figures of five for 42 as he sliced through Pakistan's middle order.</p>
