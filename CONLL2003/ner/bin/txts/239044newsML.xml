<p>Unidentified gunmen shot at a group of Manchester United soccer fans in a red-light district of Vienna on Friday after a row in a bar, hitting one in the stomach and another in the leg, police said.</p>
<p>The gunmen opened fire from a white Mercedes saloon, which sped past the group of four Britons as they were making their way back to their hotel from a bar in one of Vienna's less salubrious quarters.</p>
<p>A Vienna doctor said Steven Mark Day, 33, whose stomach injury was earlier described as life-threatening, had undergone a three-hour abdominal operation and was now out of danger.</p>
<p>&quot;He is in intensive care and is out of danger,&quot; Dr Michael Kilga of the Sozialmedizinisches Zentrum Ost hospital said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to wait two or three days to see if there are any complications but he should be able to leave hospital in 10 to 14 days,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A second man, Christopher Mackenner, was shot in the lower part of his right leg, and should be out of hospital in about a week, he added.</p>
<p>Two other men, Josef Vickers and Paul Francis Orel, escaped without injury after diving for cover on hearing the gunfire, just metres (yards) from their three-star Reichshof hotel, police said.</p>
<p>The Manchester United fans were in the Austrian capital for a match last Wednesday night against Rapid Vienna. The fans' hotel is a 20-minute walk from the Ernst Happel stadium where Manchester United won the European Champions' league match 2-0.</p>
<p>A worker at the Piccolo Sauna bar where the fans were last seen before the shooting said they arrived accompanied by two Austrians, well-known in the red light district.</p>
<p>&quot;They had two beers each and all of a sudden they started arguing. I don't know the reason but I don't think it was about girls or football,&quot; the worker, who preferred to remain anonymous, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;They didn't hit out at each other, it was just an argument. I think it was all down to a bit too much alcohol,&quot; said the worker, standing near the mirror-enclosed dancefloor.</p>
<p>The big neon-lit bar is one of many employing female dancers near Vienna's Prater amusement park, which houses the famous giant ferris-wheel -- the Riesenrad -- featured in the 1949 film of Graham Greene's classic novel &quot;The Third Man&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;When the argument started to get louder, they were told to leave. The British men left first and then the Austrians went out later,&quot; the bar worker said.</p>
<p>Bar staff knew nothing of the shooting until police cars screeched to a halt in the road and officers began questioning the clientele.</p>
