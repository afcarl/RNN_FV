VIENNA 1996-12-06

Unidentified gunmen shot at a group of Manchester United soccer fans in Vienna on Friday after a pub brawl, wounding two, one seriously, police said.

A police spokesman said a group of four Britons, in the Austrian capital for a match last Wednesday night against Rapid Vienna, were shot at from a Mercedes saloon. One named as Steven Mark Day, 33, was hit in the stomach and critically ill.

"I believe he is in a life-threatening condition," he said.

A second man, Christopher Mackenner, had a bullet wound to the right leg, he added. Two other men, Josef Vickers and Paul Francis Orel, escaped without injury.

Police said the Manchester United supporters had earlier become involved in an altercation with three Austrian men in Vienna's second district, just outside the historic centre.

"There was a fight between three Austrians and four Manchester United fans," he said.

The shooting took place in the same district, yards from the fans' hotel.

Manchester United won Wednesday night's match 2-0.
