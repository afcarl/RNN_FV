SOCCER-CZECHS TAKE GERMANY'S PLACE IN MINI WORLD CUP.

TENERIFE 1996-12-05

The Czech Republic, beaten by Germany in the final of Euro 96 in June, will represent UEFA in the inaugural Confederations Cup in Saudi Arabia next year, UEFA president Lennart Johansson said on Thursday.

Germany turned down the invitation to play in the eight-nation tournament, saying their top players would not be available.

Eight national teams are taking part in the cup, which will be played between December 12-21 next year.

The Czechs will join African champions South Africa, Oceania champions Australia, South American champions Uruguay, CONCACAF champions Mexico, World champions Brazil, the still-to-be decided Asian champions and the Saudi hosts in the competition.

UEFA also expects to start serious experiments next year with the concept of two referees controlling matches. Some inconclusive trials have been staged among amateur teams, but Johansson, speaking at the end of the executive committee meeting said: "We need to see how this works in practice at a high professional level."

Further experiments involving law changes to the three-year-old back-pass law and possible changes to the way matches are timed, will also continue, he said. Any subsequent proposals will be submitted to soccer's law-making body, the International Board, in due course.

UEFA also awarded next summer's Women's European championship finals jointly to Norway and Sweden.

That decision could serve as a useful barometer for any possible future joint Scandinavian bid for a European Championship or even a World Cup -- something Swede Johansson is known to favour.
