GOLF-DAVIES/DALY DUO TIED FOR LEAD IN JCPENNEY CLASSIC.

TARPON SPRINGS, Florida 1996-12-05

The long-hitting tandem of John Daly and Laura Davies combined for an eight-under-par 63 Thursday to share the lead after the first round of the $1.5 million JCPenney Classic.

Daly and Davies were tied with the teams of Donna Andrews and Mike Hulbert, and Sweden's Jesper Parnevik and Annika Sorenstam, who birdied the last hole. Six teams were at six-under 65 at the Innisbrook Resort.

The four-round tournament used a best-ball format Thursday and will again on Saturday. On Friday and Sunday, alternate shot play will be used.

Daly and Britain's Davies, who was named LPGA Player of the Year, led their respective Tours in driving distance. Daly, who failed to take a skin at the Skins game last week, won the PGA Tour driving distance title for the fifth time.

Hulbert and Andrews both were winless on their respective tours this year. Parnevik and Sorenstam finished third in this event last year.

Seven teams stood three shots off the pace at 66 including the marquee partnerships of defending champions Beth Daniel and Davis Love III, and Tiger Woods and Kelli Kuehne, the reigning women's U.S. and British Amateur champion.

"We played with Beth and Davis today and they can be an intimidating team," Hulbert said. "We just stayed in our shell today, which really helped."

Love and Daniel, who have a combined 42 career titles, also won the first time they were paired together in 1990. They have played together every year since, never finishing worse than tied for third. Daniel also won here with Tom Kite in 1981.
