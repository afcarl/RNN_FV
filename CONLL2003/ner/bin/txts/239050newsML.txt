RUGBY UNION-WELSH REFEREES THREATEN STRIKE.

CARDIFF 1996-12-06

Welsh rugby union referees have threatened to withdraw their services from all games played in Wales from December 20 in a dispute over pay.

The referees dropped their strike bombshell on Friday night after failing to persuade the Welsh Rugby Union to pay officials in charge of all five divisions of the National League.

A statement from the WRU said: "Negotiations between the WRU and representatives of the Welsh Society of Rugby Union Referees broke down tonight."

The referees demanded payment for handling domestic matches involving clubs from the top five divisions of the Welsh National League.

The WRU General Committee have agreed in principle to pay the referees officiating only in the first and second divisions, providing that they sign contracts with the Union.
