SOCCER-WRIGHT AND WINTERBURN ESCAPE PUNISHMENT.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Striker Ian Wright and defender Nigel Winterburn of English premier league-leading Arsenal both escaped punishment on separate misconduct charges on Friday.

Wright appeared before a three-man Football Association commission despite having admitted, and indeed apologised for, insulting remarks he made about Sheffield Wednesday manager David Pleat earlier this season.

His outburst was reported in several national newspapers.

But after hearing evidence, no action was taken against Wright, though he was warned to be careful what he says in the future.

Wright has scored 20 goals for Arsenal this season, 13 in the league.

The commission tok longer over a charge that Winterburn made rude gentures to Sheffield Wednesday fans during the same match.

Winterburn claimed he was only clenching his fists and celebrating an Arsenal goal and the commission decided there was not sufficient material to find him guilty.

The two decisions will come as a massive relief to Gunners boss Arsene Wenger whose squad is already creaking under the strain of injuries and forthcoming suspensions.
