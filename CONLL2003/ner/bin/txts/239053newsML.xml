<title>UK: SOCCER-WRIGHT AND WINTERBURN ESCAPE PUNISHMENT.</title>
<headline>SOCCER-WRIGHT AND WINTERBURN ESCAPE PUNISHMENT.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Striker Ian Wright and defender Nigel Winterburn of English premier league-leading Arsenal both escaped punishment on separate misconduct charges on Friday.</p>
<p>Wright appeared before a three-man Football Association commission despite having admitted, and indeed apologised for, insulting remarks he made about Sheffield Wednesday manager David Pleat earlier this season.</p>
<p>His outburst was reported in several national newspapers.</p>
<p>But after hearing evidence, no action was taken against Wright, though he was warned to be careful what he says in the future.</p>
<p>Wright has scored 20 goals for Arsenal this season, 13 in the league.</p>
<p>The commission tok longer over a charge that Winterburn made rude gentures to Sheffield Wednesday fans during the same match.</p>
<p>Winterburn claimed he was only clenching his fists and celebrating an Arsenal goal and the commission decided there was not sufficient material to find him guilty.</p>
<p>The two decisions will come as a massive relief to Gunners boss Arsene Wenger whose squad is already creaking under the strain of injuries and forthcoming suspensions.</p>
