<p>Leeds' England under-21 striker Lee Bowyer was fined 4,500 pounds ($7,400) on Friday for hurling chairs at restaurant staff during a disturbance at a McDonald's fast-food restaurant.</p>
<p>Bowyer, 19, who was caught in the act by security cameras, pleaded guilty to a charge of affray at a court in London. He was fined and ordered to pay a total of 175 pounds to two members of staff injured in the fracas in an east London restaurant in October.</p>
<p>Leeds had already fined Bowyer 4,000 pounds ($6,600) and warned him a repeat of his criminal behaviour could cost him his place in the side.</p>
<p>Bowyer, who moved to the Yorkshire club in August for 3.5 million pounds ($5.8 million), was expected to play against Middlesbrough on Saturday.</p>
