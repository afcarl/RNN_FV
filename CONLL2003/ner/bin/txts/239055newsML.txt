RUGBY UNION-STRANSKY TEMPTED BY ENGLISH OFFERS.

LONDON 1996-12-06

South African fly-half Joel Stransky has revealed he is tempted to join his World Cup-winning captain Francois Pienaar in English rugby.

Stransky, who will be on the replacements' bench for the Barbarians against Australia on Saturday, is considering offers to join several clubs with Leicester at the head of the queue.

"South African rugby is in a mess right now," said Stransky, overlooked for the Springboks current tour of Argentina, France and Wales.

"I will decide by next Thursday when I am due to go home. But it is tempting to return to England for a new challenge and take up one of the offers I have had.

"The South African rand is going down so fast against other currencies that we are printing our own money now, so the offers in pounds are more attractive to someone like me."

Pienaar joined London side Saracens in midweek on a two-year contract worth a reported 400,000 pounds ($658,000).
