<headline>SOCCER-ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE MATCHES THIS WEEKEND.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Matches scheduled for this weekend and Monday in the English premier league (league standings in parentheses, kick-off times 1500 GMT Saturday unless stated):</p>
<p>Arsenal (1) v Derby (9)</p>
<p>Two in-form teams meet at Highbury. Top-of-the-table Arsenal, defeated just once in their last 14 outings, won impressively at Newcastle last weekend and then beat Southampton at home on Wednesday. Defender Martin Keown is out (hamstring), England goalkeeper David Seaman is still recovering from a broken rib and Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp remains doubtful with a thigh strain. But nothing seems capable of stopping Arsenal this season. Welsh striker John Hartson is likely to keep his place while John Lukic deputises in goal. Derby have taken 10 points from 12 in their last four games and will visit London with a fully-fit squad.</p>
<p>Chelsea (7) v Everton (8)</p>
<p>Chelsea and Everton will be looking to put last week's respective defeats against Leeds and Sunderland behind them. Everton's England midfielder Nick Barmby is expected to recover from influenza and popular Scottish striker Duncan Ferguson is set to start after returning, and scoring, as a substitute last weekend. Midfielder Tony Grant is Everton's only doubt (ankle). Chelsea are set to give Eddie Newton his first start since he broke his leg. He came on as a substitute in a bad-tempered match against Leeds last week which resulted in Mark Hughes being stretchered off with a badly-gashed shin. The Weklsh striker misses out on Saturday.</p>
<p>Coventry (19) v Tottenham (11)</p>
<p>Both sides have had a miserbale time of late. Spurs, who have conceded 11 goals in three games will field Norwegian striker Steffen Iversen, who completed his signing from Rosenborg for 2.6 million pounds ($4.3 million) the day after helping the Norwegian side knock AC Milan out of the European Champions' League. Iversen is expected to wear the number 18 shirt worn by German striker Jurgen Klinsmann. Chris Armstrong misses out with a hamstring injury. Coventry, who lost 2-1 at Derby last weekend, badly need a victory after two months without one. Striker Darren Huckerby is expected to retain his place but winger Peter Ndlovu is still sidelined.</p>
<p>Leicester (12) v Blackburn (18)</p>
<p>Despite constant rumours linking Sampdoria coach Sven Goran-Eriksson of Norway with the vacant job as Blackburn manager, Tony Parkes continues as a successful caretaker boss. Norwegian defender Henning Berg has recovered from a groin strain. Blackburn will receive a psychological boost from having signed new contracts with striker Kevin Gallagher, England goalkeeper Tim Flowers, Scotland defender Colin Hendry and former England winger Jason Wilcox. Injury and illness-hit Leicester hope to build on their 2-0 win at Middlesbrough in midweek. But midfielder Scott Taylor (back injury) defender Julian Watts (hamstring) and England under-21 striker Emile Heskey (influenza) all miss out. Captai</p>
<p>Liverpool (2) v Sheffield Wednesday (10)</p>
<p>Liverpool, title favourites after their 2-0 win at Tottenham on Monday, expect to carry on the good work at Wednesday. The Anfield club's only doubts are defender John Scales (groin) and striker Stan Collymore (calf). England striker Robbie Fowler is two goals away from his century in all competitions and makes his 163rd appearance for the club. Anfield legend Ian Rush achieved his 100 goals in 166 games. Wednesday are unbeaten in their last six. They hope FIFA will lift the ban imposed on Dutch winger Regi Blinker before kick-off.</p>
<p>Middlesbrough (16) v Leeds (13)</p>
<p>Middlesbrough's recent form has plunged while the club has been embroiled in a well-publicised dispute with Brazilian Emerson, who is at home in Rio de Janeiro with his sick wife. The midfielder has been fined six weeks wages, but says he will not return until she has recovered. Compatriot Juninho is sidelined for two weeks (ankle). Striker Alan Moore is ruled out after pulling his hamstring in Tuesday night's 2-0 home defeat by Leicester. Leeds, recovering form under former Arsenal manager George Graham, have chalked up three successive clean sheets. the gritty Graham says he is building his team &quot;from the back&quot; to restore solidity and confidence.</p>
<p>Southampton (17) v Aston Villa (5)</p>
<p>Southampton are expected to be unchanged from the side that lost 3-1 to Arsenal on Wednesday and are still without England midfielder Matt Le Tissier and Allan Neilson (both thigh strains). Villa, boosted by a 2-0 midweek victory at West Ham are waiting on England's Gareth Southgate (ankle ligaments) and Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich (knee).</p>
<p>Sunderland (14) v Wimbledon (4)</p>
<p>Wimbledon visit Roker Park with an unchanged squad. The Dons have gone 17 games without defeat and are closing on the club record of 22. Sunderland have plenty of problems with Niall Quinn, Tony Coton and Lee Harvey all out long term. Richard Ord returns from suspension for the home side but Paul Stewart is still suspended.</p>
<p>West Ham United (15) v Manchester United (6) (Sunday 1600 GMT)</p>
<p>Both sides start with injury problems sustained in midweek, Manchester United's a legacy of their Champions' League victory at Rapid Vienna and West Ham's of their 2-0 home defeat by Villa. Hammers defender Tim Breaker (hamstring) is out. United will be without Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Irish international Roy Keane, who needed 30 stitches in a shin wound he sustained in Vienna and is likely to be out until New Year. West Ham's Portuguese striker Hugo Porfiro (thigh strain) may return after two weeks sidelined with a thigh strain.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest (20) v Newcastle (3) (Monday 2000 GMT)</p>
<p>Bottom club Forest seek their first win since August 17 against a Newcastle side which has not won in the premier league for over a month. Newcastle's UEFA Cup hero Faustino Asprilla is out with a pulled hamstring. Frenchman David Ginola also tweaked a hamstring in the 2-0 midweek win over Metz but is expected to play. Les Ferdidand could return to partner Alan Shearer up front for the first time since Kevin Keegan's side beat Manchester United 5-0 in October. Forest had better watch out.</p>
