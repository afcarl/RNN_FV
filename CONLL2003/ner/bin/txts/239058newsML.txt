SOCCER-GULLIT TO CASH IN ON "RUUD" CLOTHING.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Ruud Gullit, one of  the most popular and successful players in world soccer over the past decade, is to have a range of casual clothing named after him under a five-year deal with a British sports and leisurewear firm.

The dreadlocked former Dutch international, now player-manager of English premier league side Chelsea, is expected to play a role in styling the clothes which will carry his name.

"He's stylish, a great role model and very eloquent," said a company spokesman on Friday.
