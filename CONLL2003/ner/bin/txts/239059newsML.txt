SOCCER-LATIN REVOLT UNSETTLES 'BORO AHEAD OF LEEDS CLASH.

Big-spending Middlesbrough head into Saturday's English premier league dual with Leeds with a Latin revolt on their hands while their opponents, boosted by the return of their favourite Ghanaian, are as United as their name suggests.

Middlesbrough have failed to win in their last 10 league matches and the pressure is starting to show, particularly among their Brazilian and Italian imports.

Brazilian Emerson has disappeared for the third time this season and openly admits life in the north-east of England is proving difficult for both him and his wife, who has fallen ill and returned to Brazil.

"If I'd known what problems I was going to face in England, I would never have left (Portuguese champions) Porto," Emerson was quoted as telling the Sun and Daily Star newspapers from his home in Rio de Janeiro.

"Before I left for Brazil, the team knew I was returning to deal with my wife's situation, and the problem is my family, nothing else. My wife is the most important thing in my life and until she is well, I cannot come back.

"The only way to solve things would be for my family to move to England. I have tried to convince my parents to come to Middlesbrough so they could be company for us, but I have not been able to convince them to set foot in an aircraft.

"I've no reason to blame the city of Middlesbrough or the club. They have looked after me very well and have offered me very good conditions in which to work. But my switch to the system of life in England has been difficult so far."

And while Emerson is finding life in Middlesbrough a handful, Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli is losing patience with his team mates.

The former Juventus marksman has scored 16 goals since arriving on Teesside in the summer, but no sooner does he knock them in at one end, the generous Middlesbrough's defenders concede them at the other.

"I've not come to this club with the promise of relegation," Ravanelli warned. "But at this stage, without any new signings, I can hardly see how it can be avoided in spite of my goals. Football is made of a defence as well as an attack.

"I've been promised for the past couple of months that something will happen but (no new signings) appear on the horizon and we keep going down the table."

Middlesbrough are now 16th in the 20-team league after a bright start to the season which saw them rise into the leading bunch after the first six games.

To add to their misery, Emerson's compatriot Juninho is sidelined by an ankle injury and will miss Saturday's home clash, as will captain Nigel Pearson, defender Steve Vickers and forward Alan Moore.

In contrast, Leeds have hauled themselves clear of the relegation zone with four victories in their last five matches -- the latest, a 2-0 defeat of Ruud Gullit's high-flying Chelsea.

George Graham, who took over as Leeds manager in September, appears to have restored self-belief to a side which has consistently under-achieved since winning the league title in 1992.

Former Liverpool ace Ian Rush scored his first goal for the club against Chelsea, and Leeds' elegant Ghanaian forward Tony Yeboah, sidelined for two months following a cartilage operation, could make an appearance on Saturday for the first time this season.

Yeboah scored some spectacular goals for the Yorkshire side last year. If he finds the net on Saturday, Middlesbrough, tipped as title outsiders at the start of the season, could find themselves dumped into the relegation zone.
