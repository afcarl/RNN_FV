<p>Centre Jason Little will miss Australia's end-of-tour fixture against the Barbarians at Twickenham on Saturday.</p>
<p>Little has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow Queenslander Daniel Herbert.</p>
<p>Owen Finegan has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend's test against Wales and retains his place in the back-row ahead of Daniel Manu.</p>
<p>The Wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their European tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide David Campese with a fitting send-off in his final match in Australian colours.</p>
<p>The Wallabies currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic.</p>
<p>Campese will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of Barbarians captain Rob Andrew, the man who kicked Australia to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in the World Cup quarter-final in Cape Town.</p>
<p>&quot;Campo has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984,&quot; said Andrew, also likely to be making his final Twickenham appearance.</p>
<p>On tour, Australia have won all four tests against Italy, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game.</p>
<p>League duties restricted the Barbarians' selectorial options but they still boast 13 internationals including England full-back Tim Stimpson and recalled wing Tony Underwood, plus All Black forwards Ian Jones and Norm Hewitt.</p>
<p>Teams:</p>
<p>Barbarians - 15-Tim Stimpson (England); 14-Nigel Walker (Wales), 13-Allan Bateman (Wales), 12-Gregor Townsend (Scotland), 11-Tony Underwood (England); 10-Rob Andrew (England), 9-Rob Howley (Wales); 8-Scott Quinnell (Wales), 7-Neil Back (England), 6-Dale McIntosh (Pontypridd), 5-Ian Jones (New Zealand), 4-Craig Quinnell (Wales), 3-Darren Garforth (Leicester), 2-Norm Hewitt (New Zealand), 1-Nick Popplewell (Ireland).</p>
<p>Australia - 15-Matthew Burke; 14-Joe Roff, 13-Daniel Herbert, 12-Tim Horan (captain), 11-David Campese; 10-Pat Howard, 9-Sam Payne; 8-Michael Brial, 7-David Wilson, 6-Owen Finegan, 5-David Giffin, 4-Tim Gavin, 3-Andrew Blades, 2-Marco Caputo, 1-Dan Crowley.</p>
