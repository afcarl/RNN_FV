RUGBY UNION-BARBARIAN CULTURE FACES ALIEN FUTURE.

The Barbarians are due at the gates of Twickenham on Saturday but it is sharp-suited men with mobile phones who are doing most of the looting and pillaging in English rugby these days.

Whatever happens in Australia's farewell fixture at the end of an unbeaten test tour, the Wallabies will return home from Europe with first-hand evidence of the extent to which professional attitudes have taken root in the northern hemisphere.

This week's news that South Africa's World Cup-winning captain Francois Pienaar has joined the north London club Saracens for at least two years on a contract worth upwards of 400,000 pounds sterling ($649,000) would once have been inconceivable.

Now the deal merely represents the latest slab along the lucrative yellow-brick road the British game is currently taking towards...well, no one knows quite where yet.

Saracens, bought by millionaire businessman Nigel Wray a year ago, have jostled their way to the front with a series of bold initiatives which have attracted the world's most capped player, Philippe Sella, and the world's leading points scorer, Michael Lynagh.

Pienaar will also find himself rubbing shoulders with assorted other notables. Wallaby prop Tony Daly, England scrum-half Kyran Bracken and a clutch of Irish and Welsh internationals have already climbed aboard the Wray gravy train, transforming a club where corporate hospitality used to mean a pie and a pint at halftime.

Across the capital at Harlequins, it's a similar story. The diverse accents of Welsh lock Gareth Llewellyn and Irish captain Keith Wood blend in with Frenchmen Laurent Cabannes and Laurent Benezech. Rugby league signings Gary Connolly and Robbie Paul have had more multicultural experiences in three months than in their entire careers put together.

The one certainty is of more signings like Pienaar and Argentine prop Federico Mendez. The latter has joined Bath for 18 months for a reported 135,000 pounds ($219,000), despite the counter attraction of a Pumas tour of England. Bath already have four hookers, including two of the most promising English teenage players in that position. Still they plumped for Mendez, putting short-term glory ahead of long-term development.

At the last count there were 203 foreign players playing as professionals in English soccer, with dozens more invited for trials. English rugby clubs have enthusiastically embraced the same creed, without always seeming to consult their bank managers. The gap between the haves and have-nots is widening almost daily.

Already match fees have been sharply reduced at London Irish where the arrival of the professional era provided an immediate culture shock. At the start of the season, the first-team squad were all issued with top-of-the-range cars, four of them to players living in the same house. Inside a week, a neighbour had rung the police insisting they must have been stolen.

Established clubs like Orrell admit they are already unable to compete, but even Bath and Harlequins will be re-examining their sums when their imported league contingent vanish in mid-January. The likes of Jason Robinson and Henry Paul have cost around 5,000 pounds ($8,120) a match, a major investment considering few club rugby attendances ever hit the 10,000 barrier.

The end to the dispute over control of the English game certainly owed as much to financial concerns as peace-making, and there are dark whispers of impending bankruptcy for clubs too hasty to jump on the bandwagon.

For experienced players like Lynagh and Sella the new riches on offer at least represent a well-deserved pay-out at the end of long, distinguished careers.

But what about the 24-year-old English prospect who finds himself relegated to the second team to accomodate a big name? Saracens supremo Wray insists young Englishmen can only learn from big names, but quality can easily be swamped by quantity.

It makes it even more ironic to find sell-out crowds anticipating two matches at Twickenham where three-quarters of the players will not be paid a penny.

The Barbarians, including 13 internationals, play Australia on Saturday, followed by the traditional University match between Oxford and Cambridge next Tuesday, occasions which illustrate the struggle between rugby's past and future is not yet over.

"I can't pretend that we're not under pressure," admits Barbarians president Mickey Steele-Bodger. "But the Barbarians have never paid players and we hope we never will. People play better if they are not being paid, they help each other out."

The Barbarians' pre-match preparations consists of a cultural night out at Les Miserables, a pleasant change from studying videos of the Wallabies, and post-match drinking is expected to be along traditional lines.

Sadly, there is less and less room for men like Steele-Bodger in wealthy modern rugby. Even if the meek do inherit the earth, they'll find dozens of men with cauliflower ears and less-than-perfect English have beaten them to it.
