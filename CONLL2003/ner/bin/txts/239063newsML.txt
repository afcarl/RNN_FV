GOLF-MCNULTY CARDS RECORD ROUND OF 61 FOR SECOND PLACE.

HARARE 1996-12-06

Zimbabwe's Mark McNulty fired a blistering 11-under-par course record of 61 including eight successive birdies to move up to second place in the Zimbabwe Open on Friday.

The 1996 Volvo Masters champion came home in a remarkable 28 - a record nine-hole loop on the South African tour - for a 36-hole aggregate of 133, 11 under for the par-72 Chapman course.

McNulty, who won this tournament in 1992,  collected 11 birdies including eight in succession from the ninth, also a South African tour record. He had just 25 putts in his round.

He trailed South African Des Terblanche by one shot  with another South African, Steve van Vuuren, third on 134 after a 69.

Defending champion Nick Price of Zimbabwe was in a three-way tie for fourth spot on 136 following his second 68.

But the day belonged to McNulty, who said afterwards that he hit just one poor shot during his round, when indecision at the par-three eighth led him to take a five iron instead of a six.

"I went into the bunker as a result but was still able to get up and down for par. Overall, though, this round was very special - it's not often I have a 61," McNulty said.

He has done it four times before, twice on the South African tour, once in the German Open and once in Monte Carlo.

"I basically hit good shots today backed up by some good putting. While I drove the ball badly yesterday, today I got into position all the time and was able to attack the pin all the time,@ he said."

Terblanche carded a five-under-par 67 despite dropping his first two shots of the tournament over his last three holes.

He bogeyed the par-three 16th after pulling his tee shot into the bunker. Then he pushed his drive at the last out of bounds and ran up a six.

"But, overall, I played nicely and my confidence is still sky-high. I generally hit it close and my longest putt all day was from about 25 feet."

Price had halves of  33 and 35 with six birdies and dropped shots at the second and at 18.

He was impressed with Terblanche's performance. "He must be playing really good golf because 12-under is strong shooting round here."
