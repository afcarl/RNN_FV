<p>Zimbabwe's Mark McNulty fired a blistering 11-under-par course record of 61 including eight successive birdies to move up to second place in the Zimbabwe Open on Friday.</p>
<p>The 1996 Volvo Masters champion came home in a remarkable 28 - a record nine-hole loop on the South African tour - for a 36-hole aggregate of 133, 11 under for the par-72 Chapman course.</p>
<p>McNulty, who won this tournament in 1992,  collected 11 birdies including eight in succession from the ninth, also a South African tour record. He had just 25 putts in his round.</p>
<p>He trailed South African Des Terblanche by one shot  with another South African, Steve van Vuuren, third on 134 after a 69.</p>
<p>Defending champion Nick Price of Zimbabwe was in a three-way tie for fourth spot on 136 following his second 68.</p>
<p>But the day belonged to McNulty, who said afterwards that he hit just one poor shot during his round, when indecision at the par-three eighth led him to take a five iron instead of a six.</p>
<p>&quot;I went into the bunker as a result but was still able to get up and down for par. Overall, though, this round was very special - it's not often I have a 61,&quot; McNulty said.</p>
<p>He has done it four times before, twice on the South African tour, once in the German Open and once in Monte Carlo.</p>
<p>&quot;I basically hit good shots today backed up by some good putting. While I drove the ball badly yesterday, today I got into position all the time and was able to attack the pin all the time,@ he said.&quot;</p>
<p>Terblanche carded a five-under-par 67 despite dropping his first two shots of the tournament over his last three holes.</p>
<p>He bogeyed the par-three 16th after pulling his tee shot into the bunker. Then he pushed his drive at the last out of bounds and ran up a six.</p>
<p>&quot;But, overall, I played nicely and my confidence is still sky-high. I generally hit it close and my longest putt all day was from about 25 feet.&quot;</p>
<p>Price had halves of  33 and 35 with six birdies and dropped shots at the second and at 18.</p>
<p>He was impressed with Terblanche's performance. &quot;He must be playing really good golf because 12-under is strong shooting round here.&quot;</p>
