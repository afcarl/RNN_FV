OLYMPICS-IOC TEAM ARRIVES IN CAPE TOWN.

CAPE TOWN 1996-12-06

The International Olympic Committee's evaluation commission began a four-day visit on Friday to Cape Town, which hopes in 2004 to become the first African city to host the Olympic Games.

About 20 protesters met the IOC convoy just outside Cape Town's airport with posters opposing the bid. "Quality education now -- Olympics in 2024," said one poster.

Headed by 1976 fencing gold medallist Thomas Bach of Germany, the 15-member commission will assess Cape Town's bid, which filled three volumes, and visit proposed sports venues.

Officials said they would make no comment until Monday, when Bach is scheduled to address a news conference.

"The importance of this visit to Cape Town cannot be over- emphasised," Ngconde Balfour, international director of Cape Town's 2004 Olympic Bid Company, said before the IOC team arrived.

Cape Town is the last of 11 candidate cities to be visited by the commission, which, in March, will narrow the race to a short-list of four or five.

The visit got off to an inauspicious start with the brightly coloured Boeing 747 "Ndizani", which means "soar to new heights" in Zulu, delayed by more than five hours.

The IOC team was met by Sports Minister Steve Tshwete, but not by President Nelson Mandela or Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the bid's best known advocates, who had been expected to greet them before the flight delay was announced.

Mandela and Tutu were scheduled to meet the Olympic assessors on Saturday to endorse the proposal for a modest African event with a capital budget of only 7.3 billion rand ($1.57 billion).

The state-run Southern African Development Bank has calculated that the Games could inject more than 30 billion rand ($6.4 billion) into the economy over nine years and could create more than 90,000 permanent jobs.

The IOC team was scheduled later on Friday to fly by helicopter to nearby Robben Island, where Mandela spent 18 of his 27 years in jail for opposing white minority rule under apartheid.
