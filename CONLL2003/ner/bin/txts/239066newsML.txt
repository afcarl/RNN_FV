CRICKET-LLOYD SAYS HE HAS "ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE" IN ENGLAND PLAYE.

HARARE 1996-12-06

England coach David Lloyd made it clear on Friday he has "absolute confidence" in the team humbed by seven wickets with a day to spare by Mashonoland.

"After the match we just reiterated to the players that we are on a mission," said Lloyd as he reflected on Thursday's embarrassing defeat.

"We may have had a couple of reverses, we would have liked to have won, played better and competed better but I have absolute confidence in the players."

Lloyd blamed his team's second successive defeat on their Zimbabwean tour on "tentativeness".

"We didn't impose ourselves on them at all. Gary Brent (who took four wickets in England's second innings) is slow medium -- he bowls like Wayne Morton (the England physio) -- but we looked sluggish against him. The seam bowling has been under par, too.

"We're angry, frustrated and disappointed that it didn't happen as we wanted it to but we know that we are much better than that."

The fitness of skipper Mike Atherton is another concern for Lloyd. He had X-rays on his troublesome back on Thursday.

"His back is a problem but it's not something new and we will deal with it," said Lloyd. "He is in the best possible spirits."

England have a one-day match against Matabeleland on Sunday and a four- day game against the same opposition starting on Tuesday before the first one- day international against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo on December 15.
