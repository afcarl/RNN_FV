<p>England coach David Lloyd made it clear on Friday he has &quot;absolute confidence&quot; in the team humbed by seven wickets with a day to spare by Mashonoland.</p>
<p>&quot;After the match we just reiterated to the players that we are on a mission,&quot; said Lloyd as he reflected on Thursday's embarrassing defeat.</p>
<p>&quot;We may have had a couple of reverses, we would have liked to have won, played better and competed better but I have absolute confidence in the players.&quot;</p>
<p>Lloyd blamed his team's second successive defeat on their Zimbabwean tour on &quot;tentativeness&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't impose ourselves on them at all. Gary Brent (who took four wickets in England's second innings) is slow medium -- he bowls like Wayne Morton (the England physio) -- but we looked sluggish against him. The seam bowling has been under par, too.</p>
<p>&quot;We're angry, frustrated and disappointed that it didn't happen as we wanted it to but we know that we are much better than that.&quot;</p>
<p>The fitness of skipper Mike Atherton is another concern for Lloyd. He had X-rays on his troublesome back on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;His back is a problem but it's not something new and we will deal with it,&quot; said Lloyd. &quot;He is in the best possible spirits.&quot;</p>
<p>England have a one-day match against Matabeleland on Sunday and a four- day game against the same opposition starting on Tuesday before the first one- day international against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo on December 15.</p>
