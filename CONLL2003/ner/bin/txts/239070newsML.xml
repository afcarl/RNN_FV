<p>Boca Juniors, Argentina's most famous soccer team, got clearance Friday from the Buenos Aires stock exchange for a $20 million fund to finance the purchase of players and boost their sporting fortunes.</p>
<p>Boca, whose players include Diego Maradona though he has not played since August, came up with the idea of the &quot;Boca Juniors Closed Common Fund&quot; to let loyal fans cash in on transfer fees if the player acquired is later sold.</p>
<p>Shares in the historic club based in the working-class neighbourhood of Boca, on the shores of Buenos Aires' old port, will cost $100 each.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, if a player was bought for $1,000 and then sold for $1,500, from that total $1,250 will go to the fund and the rest for Boca Juniors. But if he is sold for $750, the fund must absorb the loss,&quot; the National Securities Commission explained in a statement.</p>
<p>The fund is underwritten by Boca chairman Mauricio Macri, a glamorous young businessman whose family owns a major industrial group and who took over the club a year ago.</p>
<p>Macri boasts that his first year has been a financial success, with a $6 million facelift for the 50-year-old Bombonera stadium being financed by $5 million raised from an auction of VIP boxes and by lucrative sponsorship deals with Nike sports shoes and a local beer company.</p>
<p>But he admits it has been a sporting failure, despite spending $20 million on a &quot;dream team&quot; including not only the 1986 World Cup captain Maradona, but also Claudio Caniggia and coach Carlos Bilardo, who took Argentina to the World Cup win in 1986 and the semifinals in 1990.</p>
<p>The Buenos Aires side last won the Argentine league in 1993 and is currently seventh in the first division, 15 points below its traditional Buenos Aires rival River Plate with just three matches left this season.</p>
<p>&quot;But I believe 1997 will be very prosperous for Boca in football terms,&quot; Macri told reporters, adding that Boca is now betting on training promising young players rather than buying expensive older ones.</p>
<p>&quot;The model based on one or two magic players has not given good results,&quot; he said.</p>
