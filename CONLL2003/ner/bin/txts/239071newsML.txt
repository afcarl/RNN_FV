SOCCER-GREMIO CLOSE TO BRAZILIAN FINAL.

RIO DE JANEIRO 1996-12-05

Gremio contemptuously swept aside Goias on Thursday to make almost certain of a place in the final of the Brazilian championship.

The 1995 South American champions beat Goias 3-1 away in the first leg of their semifinal and can afford to lose Sunday's second leg in their own stadium by up to two goals and still reach the final.

Goias, from the city of Goiania in the centre-west of Brazil, have never won the Brazilian championship and a packed house of 50,000 turned out at the Serra Douarda stadium hoping to see them move closer to making history.

But the home crowd was silenced after just seven minutes when Gremio's Paraguayan full-back Francisco Arce rifled home a spectacular free kick from nearly 30 meters.

Midfielder Emerson increased Gremio's lead five minutes before halftime and striker Paulo Nunes added a third midway through the second half with his 15th goal of the competition, making him joint topscorer. Evandro grabbed Goias' consolation in injury time.

Goias need to win the return match by three goals because if the aggregate score is level, Gremio go through on having the better overall record in the competition.

Gremio shocked many with their dour and physical approach as they won the Libertadores Cup last year. This year, the team seems to have mellowed but is still a tough nut to crack, especially in two-leg knockout matches.

In the other semifinal Portuguesa beat Atletico Mineiro 1-0 at home with a second-half goal by substitute Alex Alves, who was left with a simple tap-in after a spectacular run by Rodrigo, one of the discoveries of the tournament, opened up the Atletico defence.

Atletico, who have the better overall record, had full-back Paulo Roberto sent off for elbowing an opponent.
