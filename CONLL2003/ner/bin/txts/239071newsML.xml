<p>Gremio contemptuously swept aside Goias on Thursday to make almost certain of a place in the final of the Brazilian championship.</p>
<p>The 1995 South American champions beat Goias 3-1 away in the first leg of their semifinal and can afford to lose Sunday's second leg in their own stadium by up to two goals and still reach the final.</p>
<p>Goias, from the city of Goiania in the centre-west of Brazil, have never won the Brazilian championship and a packed house of 50,000 turned out at the Serra Douarda stadium hoping to see them move closer to making history.</p>
<p>But the home crowd was silenced after just seven minutes when Gremio's Paraguayan full-back Francisco Arce rifled home a spectacular free kick from nearly 30 meters.</p>
<p>Midfielder Emerson increased Gremio's lead five minutes before halftime and striker Paulo Nunes added a third midway through the second half with his 15th goal of the competition, making him joint topscorer. Evandro grabbed Goias' consolation in injury time.</p>
<p>Goias need to win the return match by three goals because if the aggregate score is level, Gremio go through on having the better overall record in the competition.</p>
<p>Gremio shocked many with their dour and physical approach as they won the Libertadores Cup last year. This year, the team seems to have mellowed but is still a tough nut to crack, especially in two-leg knockout matches.</p>
<p>In the other semifinal Portuguesa beat Atletico Mineiro 1-0 at home with a second-half goal by substitute Alex Alves, who was left with a simple tap-in after a spectacular run by Rodrigo, one of the discoveries of the tournament, opened up the Atletico defence.</p>
<p>Atletico, who have the better overall record, had full-back Paulo Roberto sent off for elbowing an opponent.</p>
