<p>Australia gave Brian Lara another reason to be miserable when they beat West Indies by five wickets in the opening World Series limited overs match on Friday.</p>
<p>Lara, disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday, was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour.</p>
<p>Australia, who hold a 2-0 lead in the five-match test series, overhauled West Indies' total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats.</p>
<p>All-rounder Greg Blewett steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42,442 crowd.</p>
<p>Man-of-the match Blewett came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes.</p>
<p>His crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder Stuart Law, who scored 21, added 71 off 85 balls.</p>
<p>Lara looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to Shane Warne at mid-wicket.</p>
<p>West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd has apologised for Lara's behaviour on Tuesday. He (Lara) had told Australia coach Geoff Marsh that wicketkeeper Ian Healy was unwelcome in the visitors' dressing room.</p>
<p>The Melbourne crowd were clearly angered by the incident, loudly jeering the West Indies vice-captain as he walked to the middle.</p>
<p>It was left to fellow left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin.</p>
<p>Chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out.</p>
<p>Pakistan, who arrive in Australia later this month, are the other team competing in the World Series tournament.</p>
