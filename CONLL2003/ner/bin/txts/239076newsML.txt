CRICKET-LARA FALLS CHEAPLY AS WEST INDIES AGAIN STRUGGLE.

MELBOURNE 1996-12-06

Brian Lara endured another unhappy day on his troubled tour as Australia bowled out West Indies for 172 in the opening World Series limited overs match on Friday.

Lara, who was disciplined by West Indies management for an angry outburst against Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy on Tuesday, was dismissed for five.

He looked uncomfortable during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom Moody straight to Shane Warne at mid-wicket to prolong a disappointing run of form.

The West Indies vice-captain has yet to score a century in Australia since the tour began five weeks ago and failed in both innings of the second test in Sydney.

It was left to fellow left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul to hold the innings together with a gritty and patient 54 despite a groin injury.

Chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid a possible run out.

Chanderpaul, who came to the wicket with the total on 38 for two, faced 100 balls and hit just one four before lofting a catch to Healy to end the innings after 49.2 overs.

Moody, leg spinner Shane Warne and pace bowler Jason Gillespie each claimed two wickets.
