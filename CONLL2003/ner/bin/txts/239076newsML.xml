<p>Brian Lara endured another unhappy day on his troubled tour as Australia bowled out West Indies for 172 in the opening World Series limited overs match on Friday.</p>
<p>Lara, who was disciplined by West Indies management for an angry outburst against Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy on Tuesday, was dismissed for five.</p>
<p>He looked uncomfortable during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom Moody straight to Shane Warne at mid-wicket to prolong a disappointing run of form.</p>
<p>The West Indies vice-captain has yet to score a century in Australia since the tour began five weeks ago and failed in both innings of the second test in Sydney.</p>
<p>It was left to fellow left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul to hold the innings together with a gritty and patient 54 despite a groin injury.</p>
<p>Chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid a possible run out.</p>
<p>Chanderpaul, who came to the wicket with the total on 38 for two, faced 100 balls and hit just one four before lofting a catch to Healy to end the innings after 49.2 overs.</p>
<p>Moody, leg spinner Shane Warne and pace bowler Jason Gillespie each claimed two wickets.</p>
