CRICKET-BOON HITS CENTURY AS TASMANIA FORGE AHEAD.

HOBART, Australia 1996-12-06

Centuries by former Australia batsman David Boon and opener Michael DiVenuto put Tasmania in a strong position on the opening day of their Sheffield Shield match against Victoria on Friday.

Boon, who retired from test cricket last year, was 106 not out at stumps as Tasmania reached 352 for three.

DiVenuto had earlier scored a dashing 119, the seventh century of his first-class career.

Boon, who brought up his 60th first-class century, was at the crease with all-rounder Shaun Young on 86 not out.

Brad Williams was the only Victorian bowler to make an impression on the Tasmanian batsmen, the right-arm pace bowler taking two for 87 from 19 overs.

Williams had DiVenuto caught at cover point.

Boon earlier won the toss and chose to bat at the start of the four-day match in overcast conditions at Hobart's Bellerive Oval.
