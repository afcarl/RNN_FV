<headline>CRICKET-BOON HITS CENTURY AS TASMANIA FORGE AHEAD.</headline>
<dateline>HOBART, Australia 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Centuries by former Australia batsman David Boon and opener Michael DiVenuto put Tasmania in a strong position on the opening day of their Sheffield Shield match against Victoria on Friday.</p>
<p>Boon, who retired from test cricket last year, was 106 not out at stumps as Tasmania reached 352 for three.</p>
<p>DiVenuto had earlier scored a dashing 119, the seventh century of his first-class career.</p>
<p>Boon, who brought up his 60th first-class century, was at the crease with all-rounder Shaun Young on 86 not out.</p>
<p>Brad Williams was the only Victorian bowler to make an impression on the Tasmanian batsmen, the right-arm pace bowler taking two for 87 from 19 overs.</p>
<p>Williams had DiVenuto caught at cover point.</p>
<p>Boon earlier won the toss and chose to bat at the start of the four-day match in overcast conditions at Hobart's Bellerive Oval.</p>
