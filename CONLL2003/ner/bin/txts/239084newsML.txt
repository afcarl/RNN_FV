Two goals each from Aly Ashour and Mohamed Ouda gave Arab Contractors a flattering 4-0 win over Sodigraf of Zaire and victory in the African Cup Winners' Cup in Cairo on Friday.

It was the Egyptian team's third success in the tournament but their first continental trophy in 13 years.

The first leg in Kinshasa two weeks ago ended in a goalless draw, giving Contractors a 4-0 win on aggregate as well.

Ashour  fired Contractors ahead  in the seventh minute with a powerful free kick that Sodigraf's goalkeeper Nzambangisi Babale let slip through his hands.

"We practise that in training all the time. Even our goalkeepers can't stop them," Contractors' German-born coach Michael Kruger said afterwards amid scenes of hysterical celebration.

Another error by Babale allowed defender Ouda to score an easy second goal in the 24th minute against the run of play.

Sodigraf paid for several squandered chances 11 minutes into the second half when Ashour converted a penalty and Ouda chipped a speculative effort in from the edge of the penalty area in the 73rd minute for the fourth.

Contractors goalkeeper Ahmed Saber made two fine saves in the final 15 minutes to deny Sodigraf a consolation goal in the half-empty Cairo stadium.

The victory was marred by attacks on a small contingent of Zairian fans, who were pelted with stones by Egyptian fans from the stands above them.
