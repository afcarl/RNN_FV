<p>Michael Johnson and Gail Devers crowned gold medal seasons Friday by winning the Jesse Owens Awards at USA Track &amp; Field's annual meeting.</p>
<p>It was an unprecedented third successive Owens award for Johnson, who became the first athlete in the 15-year history of the award to turn a hat trick.</p>
<p>Johnson had a dream season, winning an historic Olympic double in the 200 and 400 meters. The Texan shattered his own world record in the 200 at the Games, clocking a spectacular 19.32 seconds. He also extended his 400 meter finals winning streak to 57 straight.</p>
<p>Devers, who also won the award in 1993, tied Jackie Joyner-Kersee for most Owens honours by a woman.</p>
<p>Devers claimed the sole American women's individual gold in Atlanta, dashing to the 100 meters title. She also won gold on the 4x100 meter relay team and placed fourth in the 100 meter hurdles.</p>
<p>Olympic decathlon champion Dan O'Brien finished a distant second behind Johnson in the men's voting, 2,084 votes to 1,450.</p>
<p>Devers won the women's award by 1,994 to 1,293 over Olympic 4x100 relay teammate and 200 meter bronze medallist Gwen Torrence.</p>
