NHL ICE HOCKEY-FLORIDA OVERCOMES 2-0 DEFICIT TO REACH 40-POINT MARK.

MIAMI 1996-12-06

Robert Svehla's wrist shot snapped a tie as the Florida Panthers overcame a two-goal deficit to defeat the New York Islanders 4-2 on Thursday and become the first NHL team with 40 points.

Svehla snapped the winner over goaltender Eric Fichaud's shoulder from the right faceoff circle for his 12th goal, giving Florida a 3-2 edge 3:13 into the third period. Mike Hough scored his fourth goal to close the scoring 2:42 later.

Ex-Islander Mark Fitzpatrick made 40 saves and improved to 6-1-2 for the Panthers (17-4-6), who are 6-1-1 in their last eight games.

"I felt great," Fitzpatrick said. "The last two periods we came out and played strong.  We scored two big goals and played great hockey in the third. It's a team I played for for five years. I really get fired up against the Islanders."

Fichaud made 32 saves but fell to 3-5-4.

"It was a reasonable effort," said Islanders coach Mike Milbury. "I'm just a little disappointed we didn't get more out of a couple of players without naming any names."

In St Louis, Darcy Wakaluk made 33 saves for his ninth career shutout and Oleg Tverdovsky had a goal and an assist as the Phoenix Coyotes handed the St Louis Blues their second consecutive shutout 3-0.

The Blues, who have lost three straight home games, had not been shut out in consecutive games since December 12-13, 1978, a span of 1,331 games.

Wakaluk, who signed as a free agent after spending the last four seasons with Dallas, made seven saves in the first period, 18 in the second and eight in the third to earn his first win in 11 lifetime decisions against St Louis (1-7-3).

"It's nice for me, but I am the type of guy who is more happy for the guys in the dressing room. They really put in a good effort tonight," said Wakaluk.

In Boston, Geoff Sanderson scored his 16th goal and Nelson Emerson added a goal and an assist as the Hartford Whalers defeated the Boston Bruins 4-2.

The victory snapped Hartford's six-game winless streak in Boston. The Whalers were 0-5-1 coming in.

Jason Muzzatti made 30 saves for Hartford and improved to 5-2-3. "We're on such a roll right now. We know we can play well. We just had to forget about everything in the past that's happened here," said Muzzatti.

"It's just finally nice to win a big game here against these guys on their own rink. It's been a long time coming."

At New Jersey, Bobby Holik had a goal and an assist and Martin Brodeur made 25 saves as the New Jersey Devils edged the floundering Calgary Flames 2-1.

Calgary lost for the seventh time in its last eight games and have managed just 11 goals in that span.

With the score tied 1-1 in the third period, Holik took a pass from Patrik Elias in the neutral zone, stepped around Theoren Fleury, skated down the left wing and fired a slap shot that beat rookie Dwayne Roloson at 4:24.

"Someway, somehow, we have to find someone out there who will find us a way to win," Flames coach Pierre Page said. "Our top six forwards have to be committed to winning more than they are now."

In Los Angeles, Alexander Selivanov's second period power-play goal snapped a tie and lifted the Tampa Bay Lightning to a 2-1 win over the struggling Los Angeles Kings.

The win ended Tampa Bay's six-game losing streak and extended their all-time mark at the Great Western Forum to 5-0. Los Angeles has dropped six of its last seven games.

On the clincher, Kings goaltender Byron Dafoe made a save on a shot by Drew Bannister, but when Rob Blake tried to clear the puck from in front, Selivanov intercepted the pass and beat Dafoe with a wrister at 8:18.
