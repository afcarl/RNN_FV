NBA BASKETBALL-NEW BULL TAKES CHARGE IN VICTORY OVER CLIPPERS.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

A new Bull took charge on Thursday as Jason Caffey scored 13 of his career-high 23 points in a 21-4 fourth-quarter run that pushed Chicago past the Los Angeles Clippers 114-96.

Scottie Pippen scored 25 points and Michael Jordan added 20 for the Bulls, who improved their NBA-best record to 17-1 and remained unbeaten in seven games at home.

But it was Caffey who provided the spark for Chicago, who led 62-57 at halftime. The second-year forward from Alabma topped his previous high of 13 points by shooting 11-of-13 from the field in 24 minutes off the bench.

"I think everybody has been waiting for him to show his talent on the basketball court," Jordan said. "He has the ability to play with that type of intensity."

Pooh Richardson scored 20 points, Loy Vaught had 19 and Brent Barry contributed 17 for Los Angeles, which led early in the third quarter but could not keep the Bulls down.

"We accomplished a lot the first three quarters, playing their starters even," said Clippers coach Bill Fitch. "Then their bench took the game away."

"It seemed like Caffey just got in a zone there at the end," Vaught said. "We had a very difficult time trying to control him. It shows you how much talent they have there on that team."

In Toronto, 40-year-old John Long hit a jumper with nine seconds left to complete a comeback from a 17-point third-quarter deficit as the Toronto Raptors rallied for an 82-80 victory over the Washington Bullets.

Walt Williams scored 29 points and Doug Christie added 19 with 11 rebounds, seven assists and a career-high six steals for Toronto, which won its third consecutive home game.

Long, who signed last week, put Toronto ahead 81-80 by drilling a jumper from the right corner. He last played in the NBA during the 1990-91 season and was with Magic Johnson's travelling all-star team this year before being acquired.

"Fortunately, it came to me, I had it and I made it," Long said. "You always have to be mentally ready so when you get put into that situation, you feel capable of making the shot.

"My main goal has been to learn the plays as fast as I can."

In Dallas, the Mavericks used a late fourth-quarter run to put down the Philadelphia 76ers 106-102.

Jimmy Jackson scored 21 points and Derek Harper added a season-high 20 for Dallas, which has alternated losses and wins for the last six games.

Rookie Allen Iverson had a season-high 36 points and 11 assists but committed seven turnovers for Philadelphia, which has dropped four of its last five road games.

After Iverson hit a jumper to give the 76ers a 92-90 lead with three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Jackson made a reverse layup to tie the game and ignite a 9-0 run.

In Denver, Isaiah Rider scored 15 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter as the Portland Trail Blazers overcame a career night by Bryant Stith to down the Denver Nuggets 115-104.

Kenny Anderson scored 26 points and Arvydas Sabonis added 22 for Portland, which has won seven of its last 10 games.

Stith scored a career-high 37 points for Denver, which has lost five straight games under new coach Dick Motta.

Portland rookie Jermaine O'Neal, 18, became the youngest player to appear in an NBA game when he came in at 7:24 of the second quarter. He made his only shot of the field, committed a personal foul and had two turnovers in three minutes.

In Seattle, Shawn Kemp scored 17 of his 21 points in the first half as the SuperSonics raced to a 22-point lead on the way to a 117-86 demolition of the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Kemp grabbed 15 rebounds, Larry Stewart scored 19 points and Gary Payton had 18 and seven assists for Seattle, which defeated Minnesota for the 23rd consecutive time.

Tom Gugliotta scored 27 points on 10-of-14 shooting and grabbed 10 rebounds for Minnesota, which played without injured forward Kevin Garnett and guard James Robinson.
