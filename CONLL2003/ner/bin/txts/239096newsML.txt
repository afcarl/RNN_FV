BASEBALL-SERIES HERO LEYRITZ TRADED, TWINS SIGN STEINBACH.

NEW YORK 1996-12-05

Baseball greeted a new era of labour peace with a bang on Thursday with a slew of deals, including one that sent a World Series hero packing.

Jim Leyritz, whose dramatic Game 4 homer ignited the Yankees' run to the World Series title, was traded by New York to the Anaheim Angels for a pair of minor leaguers to be named later.

"For me, it's an opportunity to play," Leyritz told WFAN Sports Radio. Leyritz had the longest continuous term of service with the Yankees -- seven years -- but was not an everyday player.

The Yankees lost the first two games of the World Series to the Braves and, after winning Game 3, trailed 6-3 in the eighth inning of Game 4 when Leyritz belted a three-run homer off Braves closer Mark Wohlers to tie the game.

The Yankees won it 8-6 in 10 innings and captured the final two games for their 23rd World Series title.

That was not the first dramatic post-season homer for Leyritz. The utilityman, who has played catcher, first base, third base and the outfield, also homered in the 15th inning of Game 2 of the 1995 American League Divisional Series, giving the Yankees a 7-5 victory over the Seattle Mariners.

The 32-year-old Leyritz hit .264 with seven homers and 40 RBI last season. The Yankees have a promising young catcher, Jorge Posada, ready to back-up regular Joe Girardi.

The Minnesota Twins, who under the new collective bargaining agreement approved by the Players Association Thursday will receive revenue sharing help as a small market team, made a big splash in the free agent market.

Free agent catcher Terry Steinbach, who had spent his entire career with the Oakland Athletics, returned home when he signed a two-year contract with the Twins.

The contract was reported by the Saint Paul Pioneer Press to be worth $3 million per season.

"Once again this is a case where a player came back to Minnesota for a very, very, small amount compared to what he could have gotten elsewhere," said Twins general manager Terry Ryan.

The 34-year-old Steinbach is a native of New Ulm, Minnesota and was a star at the University of Minnesota.

"For myself, being a local guy, I got to watch the Twins play for a lot of years and played against them for a few more years," Steinbach said. "I'm real excited about finally joining them and hopefully we can build on this."

Steinbach, one of the best receivers in the game, was a prized free agent after hitting .272 with a career-high 35 homers and 100 RBI in 1996. The three-time All-Star had hit 97 homers in his previous nine major league seasons.

On the managerial front, Felipe Alou, who has kept the Montreal Expos in pennant contention despite a series of cost-cutting moves by management, was rewarded with a contract extension by the club through the 1999 season.

"We are extremely happy that Felipe will continue to lead the Expos," general manager Jim Beattie said. "This is a man that fulfils all the leadership, managerial, and emotional needs of our organisation, our players and our fans."
