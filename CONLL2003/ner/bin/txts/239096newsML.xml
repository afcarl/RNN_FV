<p>Baseball greeted a new era of labour peace with a bang on Thursday with a slew of deals, including one that sent a World Series hero packing.</p>
<p>Jim Leyritz, whose dramatic Game 4 homer ignited the Yankees' run to the World Series title, was traded by New York to the Anaheim Angels for a pair of minor leaguers to be named later.</p>
<p>&quot;For me, it's an opportunity to play,&quot; Leyritz told WFAN Sports Radio. Leyritz had the longest continuous term of service with the Yankees -- seven years -- but was not an everyday player.</p>
<p>The Yankees lost the first two games of the World Series to the Braves and, after winning Game 3, trailed 6-3 in the eighth inning of Game 4 when Leyritz belted a three-run homer off Braves closer Mark Wohlers to tie the game.</p>
<p>The Yankees won it 8-6 in 10 innings and captured the final two games for their 23rd World Series title.</p>
<p>That was not the first dramatic post-season homer for Leyritz. The utilityman, who has played catcher, first base, third base and the outfield, also homered in the 15th inning of Game 2 of the 1995 American League Divisional Series, giving the Yankees a 7-5 victory over the Seattle Mariners.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old Leyritz hit .264 with seven homers and 40 RBI last season. The Yankees have a promising young catcher, Jorge Posada, ready to back-up regular Joe Girardi.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Twins, who under the new collective bargaining agreement approved by the Players Association Thursday will receive revenue sharing help as a small market team, made a big splash in the free agent market.</p>
<p>Free agent catcher Terry Steinbach, who had spent his entire career with the Oakland Athletics, returned home when he signed a two-year contract with the Twins.</p>
<p>The contract was reported by the Saint Paul Pioneer Press to be worth $3 million per season.</p>
<p>&quot;Once again this is a case where a player came back to Minnesota for a very, very, small amount compared to what he could have gotten elsewhere,&quot; said Twins general manager Terry Ryan.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old Steinbach is a native of New Ulm, Minnesota and was a star at the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>&quot;For myself, being a local guy, I got to watch the Twins play for a lot of years and played against them for a few more years,&quot; Steinbach said. &quot;I'm real excited about finally joining them and hopefully we can build on this.&quot;</p>
<p>Steinbach, one of the best receivers in the game, was a prized free agent after hitting .272 with a career-high 35 homers and 100 RBI in 1996. The three-time All-Star had hit 97 homers in his previous nine major league seasons.</p>
<p>On the managerial front, Felipe Alou, who has kept the Montreal Expos in pennant contention despite a series of cost-cutting moves by management, was rewarded with a contract extension by the club through the 1999 season.</p>
<p>&quot;We are extremely happy that Felipe will continue to lead the Expos,&quot; general manager Jim Beattie said. &quot;This is a man that fulfils all the leadership, managerial, and emotional needs of our organisation, our players and our fans.&quot;</p>
