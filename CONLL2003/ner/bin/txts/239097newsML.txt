SOCCER-LEVERKUSEN'S DRAWS 2-2 WITH BOCHUM.

BONN 1996-12-06

An 89th minute goal from Dariusz Wosz earned Bochum a 2-2 home draw with German first division leaders Bayer Leverkusen on Friday and may have cost Leverkusen the title of "autumn champions."

Although Leverkusen are now one point ahead of Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga standings, they could lose the lead to before the winter break should Bayern defeat the weaker Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday.

The draw also meant Leverkusen were unable to break Bochum's unbeaten record at home since December 1995.

Leverkusen set the pace and dominated the midfield for the first half hour, with Ulf Kirsten first missing a gilt-edged opportunity from six metres in the eigth minute and then scoring his 11th goal of the season 10 minutes later.

Bochum fought back and took the upper hand after they were awarded a penalty in the 30th minute -- following a foul from Nico Kovac on Wosz -- which Thomas Stickroth easily netted for the equaliser.

Georgi Dokow almost gave Bochum the lead before the break, but his shot from six metres was only just saved on the line by Markus Happe.

Carsten Ramelow made it 2-1 for Leverkusen in the 56th minute, shortly before the home side were reduced to 10 men when defender Torsten Kracht was suspended after two yellow card bookings.

Despite the handicap, Wosz made it 2-2 with his last minute goal.

"We didn't have the required amount of luck on our side needed in the decisive moments," said Leverkusen coach Christoph Daum. "We started off well but Bochum got the better of us after the equaliser."

Bochum coach Klaus Toppmoeller said: "It was difficult for us with only 10 men. However, the morale of the team is sensational."

Karlsruhe boosted their morale on Friday, only three days after losing 0-5 in the UEFA Cup, with a 3-0 victory over Freiburg and are now fifth in the standings.

In other Bundesliga action, Werder Bremen held 1860 Munich to a 1-1 draw at home, while Schalke won on home turf against Hansa Rostock.
