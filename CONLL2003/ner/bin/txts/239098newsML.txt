SOCCER-NANCY UPSET LEADERS PSG 2-1 AT PARC.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Northern Ireland forward Phil Gray struck a last-minute winner as relegation candidates Nancy came from behind to inflict a shock 2-1 home defeat on leaders Paris St Germain in the French first division on Friday.

The Parisian team's players were jeered off the pitch by their own fans in a 30,000 crowd at the Parc des Princes for failing to breach the visiting defence again after taking a second-minute lead and succumbing to two killer counter-punches.

PSG, beaten at home for the first time since April, remain only one point ahead of Monaco, who are at home to Guingamp on Saturday. Even a draw would put Monaco on top on goal difference.

It was only Nancy's third win in 21 matches though not quite enough to lift them from penultimate place.

Defender and captain Paul Fischer headed Nancy's equaliser 20 minutes from time after France midfielder Bruno N'Gotty had put PSG ahead in the second minute.

Nantes went a record 14 matches unbeaten with a 4-0 away win over Lens which also increased to 41 goals in 21 games the total scored by the best attack in the division.

Lens were down to 10 men early in the second half when defender David Regis was sent off for a second bookable offence, a violent foul on striker Japhet N'Doram.

The win also lifted Nantes to eighth, continuing their steady climb after a disastrous start to the season in which they did not win in their first 10 matches.

N'Doram is joint top scorer in the division with 14 goals after opening the score in the seventh minute.
