<p>Northern Ireland forward Phil Gray struck a last-minute winner as relegation candidates Nancy came from behind to inflict a shock 2-1 home defeat on leaders Paris St Germain in the French first division on Friday.</p>
<p>The Parisian team's players were jeered off the pitch by their own fans in a 30,000 crowd at the Parc des Princes for failing to breach the visiting defence again after taking a second-minute lead and succumbing to two killer counter-punches.</p>
<p>PSG, beaten at home for the first time since April, remain only one point ahead of Monaco, who are at home to Guingamp on Saturday. Even a draw would put Monaco on top on goal difference.</p>
<p>It was only Nancy's third win in 21 matches though not quite enough to lift them from penultimate place.</p>
<p>Defender and captain Paul Fischer headed Nancy's equaliser 20 minutes from time after France midfielder Bruno N'Gotty had put PSG ahead in the second minute.</p>
<p>Nantes went a record 14 matches unbeaten with a 4-0 away win over Lens which also increased to 41 goals in 21 games the total scored by the best attack in the division.</p>
<p>Lens were down to 10 men early in the second half when defender David Regis was sent off for a second bookable offence, a violent foul on striker Japhet N'Doram.</p>
<p>The win also lifted Nantes to eighth, continuing their steady climb after a disastrous start to the season in which they did not win in their first 10 matches.</p>
<p>N'Doram is joint top scorer in the division with 14 goals after opening the score in the seventh minute.</p>
