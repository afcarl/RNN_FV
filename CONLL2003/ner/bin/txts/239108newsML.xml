<p>Defending champion Goran Ivanisevic used his record-breaking serve to boost his earnings at the Grand Slam Cup to more than $3.2 million with a 6-4 6-4 quarter-final victory over Australian Mark Woodforde on Friday.</p>
<p>The big-serving Croat, who before this year had earned $2.8 million in four appearances at the most lucrative event in the game, made sure of adding another $431,250 to his bank balance with a straightforward win in just 66 minutes.</p>
<p>Ivanisevic became the third player to reach the last four after three-times Wimbledon champion Boris Becker and Britain's Tim Henman booked their places in the semifinals on Thursday.</p>
<p>The fourth will be decided in a match between French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov and American Jim Courier.</p>
<p>On the way to his victory, Ivanisevic took his total of aces for the year to a record of more than 1,500.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I can say that I am the best server in the game,&quot; Ivanisevic said.</p>
<p>Woodforde added: &quot;I have a lot of respect for that serve because he's able to serve incredibly well. That's probably one of tennis's phenomenons, Goran Ivanisevic's serve.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about his strategy against the Croat, the Australian added. &quot;I think it's obvious. I just try and get the ball back over the net often enough.&quot;</p>
<p>The best performers from the four grand slams -- Wimbledon and the U.S., French and Australian Opens -- qualify for a shot at the jackpot of $1.625 million paid out to the Munich winner.</p>
<p>Although he has twice been a runner-up at Wimbledon, Ivanisevic has never won a grand slam. But he has a good record at the Cup. In addition to last year's triumph the towering Croat player has reached the semifinals twice.</p>
<p>Ivanisevic's huge serve is a major asset on the fast indoor surface. It makes it very difficult for his opponents to get on top of his game, as Woodforde found out.</p>
<p>Woodforde had his own serve broken in the third game and Ivanisevic soon had the first set in 31 minutes. Another break in the first game of the second set effectively clinched his place in the semifinals.</p>
<p>The Croat did drop his serve in the eighth game but broke back immediately before finishing off the second set in 33 minutes.</p>
