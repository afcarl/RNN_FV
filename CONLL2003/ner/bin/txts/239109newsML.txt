MOTOR RACING-TYRE AND BRAKE CHANGES AHEAD FOR F1 CARS.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Formula One cars will have modifications to tyres and brakes in the 1998 world championship.

Out go the "slick" treadless dry weather tyres, to be replaced by grooved compounds, the International Automobile Federation (FIA) World Council decided on Friday.

New rules on brakes will be introduced, aimed at increasing stopping distances. This means that drivers will have to brake earlier on approaching corners, theoretically giving a more skilful driver the chance to overtake.

The FIA also decided to reduce the maximum overall width of the cars to 180 cm from the present 200 cm to reduce cornering speeds and assist overtaking.
