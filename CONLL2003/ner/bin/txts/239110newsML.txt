MOTOR RACING-AUSTRIA RETURNS TO 17-RACE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP.

PARIS 1996-12-06

A 17-race 1997 Formula One world championship which includes the Austrian Grand Prix for the first time since 1987 was approved by the International Automobile Federation (FIA) on Friday.

The season -- one race longer than this year but the same number as 1995 -- opens in traditional fashion with the Australian Grand Prix at Melbourne on March 9, but is expected to end in Portugal for the first time.

Estoril will host the finale on October 26 provided circuit improvements are completed by January 31.

The last round will be switched to Jerez, Spain on the same date if Estoril fail to meet the FIA deadline.

Engine suppliers Renault who are quitting Formula One at the end of the season asked if the last race could be held on a European circuit.

Zeltweg, once one of the fastest tracks in the world, will stage the Austrian round of the championship at the rebuilt A1-Ring on September 21.

A series of start-line crashes and other incidents there nine years ago contributed to its deletion from the calendar. Zeltweg has lobbied hard for reinstatement for several seasons.
