<p>Britain's Tim Henman, who has enjoyed the most lucrative week of his life at the Grand Slam Cup, is capable of getting into the very top echelons of tennis, Boris Becker's former coach said on Friday.</p>
<p>Henman, who faces Becker in Saturday's semifinals of the $6 million event where $812,500 will be at stake, plays some shots like the present master of the game -- world number one Pete Sampras -- according to Germany's Davis Cup coach Niki Pilic.</p>
<p>&quot;When I first saw him some of his strokes reminded me of Pete Sampras,&quot; said Pilic who has worked with some of the best players in the game. &quot;He is capable of getting into the top 10. There are no guarantees but he certainly has the potential to get up there.&quot;</p>
<p>Henman, ranked 29th in the world, has already earned $431,250 for reaching the last four of the richest tournament in tennis, doubling his earnings for the year in just two matches. He is the biggest surprise of the event which pays out $1.625 million to the winner.</p>
<p>The Briton gave a commanding display of serving in a quarter-final defeat of Wimbledon finalist MaliVai Washington on Thursday. Saturday's clash with Becker is arguably the biggest test of his career.</p>
<p>Pilic, who has worked closely with Becker for many years, said it was not impossible that the Briton might cause an upset.</p>
<p>But he faces an immense task against the three-times Wimbledon champion who is playing some of the best tennis of his life and has the advantage of playing in front of his fanatical home supporters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is possible (that Henman could win),&quot; Pilic said. &quot;But it would be a very big surprise. Boris is playing so well. He is serving so well and he has a lot of confidence. But it is not impossible.&quot;</p>
<p>Henman reached the quarter-finals of Wimbledon this year but next season will be one of the most difficult years of his life as he attempts to build on his success. Britain has not had a tennis player of his class for many years and expectations at home are high.</p>
<p>Pilic believes the 22-year-old Henman, who is coached by little-known David Felgate, needs 18 months to reach his full potential if he wants to become a major figure on the circuit.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe he can keep his feet on the ground. He knows he can improve and he has a good trainer. He needs 18 months to become a finished player and get the experience,&quot; said Pilic, who has played a major role in turning Germany into a tennis power in the last decade.</p>
<p>&quot;It is good to see England getting a top tennis player because, ever since Mark Cox and Buster Mottram, there has been nobody for 20 years...After a couple of good wins, there can be too much written and too many expectations. But I think he can deal with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like everyone he can have three or five months when he is not hitting the ball well. That is when he will need the support of the press.&quot;</p>
<p>Becker is taking nothing for granted against the Briton and was training hard for the match on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Once you get to the stage of playing a semifinal, whoever you are going to play has won two tough matches already,&quot; the German said. &quot;At that stage the name doesn't matter anymore.&quot;</p>
