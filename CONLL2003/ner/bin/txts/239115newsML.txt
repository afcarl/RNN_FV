SOCCER SHOWCASE-REAL EXCITEMENT AROUSED BY BARCELONA DUEL.

MADRID 1996-12-06

Even by normal standards Saturday's eagerly-awaited duel between Real Madrid and Barcelona has aroused Spanish passions to levels comparable with any club fixture in the world.

Coaches Fabio Capello and Bobby Robson, both experiencing the big occasion for the first time in their respective roles, have been involved in some big games elsewhere in Europe but the latest edition promises to be a huge test of nerve for both men.

With 35 points from 15 games, unbeaten league leaders Real have a one-point advantage over their arch-rivals, with Deportivo Coruna snapping at their heels a further point back.

Real and Barcelona are also aware the psychological effects of victory in the game can be enormous. This season even more so, because the sides will only play one more league game before January 5, a long time in which to ponder defeat.

Strangely, though, both sides could do with a boost after beginning their title challenges with some erratic, if effective, performances.

Most commentators conclude that Spain's 'grandees' rely excessively on the individual brilliance of players like Barcelona's Ronaldo and Real's Davor Suker and Predrag Mijatovic, all new to Spain's biggest game along with Capello and Robson.

The Italian has had the best of the former England manager in previous meetings. While at AC Milan Capello took two wins and a draw from clashes with PSV Eindhoven and Porto, sides then managed by Robson.

But Robson can claim to have led England to a convincing 4-2 victory over Spain in the Bernabeu stadium, with four goals from former Barcelona striker Gary Lineker.

A hat-trick would be quite enough for the man who now wears the number nine shirt for Barcelona.

"It would be really a dream if I were to do it," said Ronaldo, who has prepared for the big game by watching videos of his compatriot Romario leading Barcelona to a spectacular 5-0 thrashing of Real three seasons ago.

"I hope we can repeat that.  We're stronger and we have more quality," said the brilliant young Brazilian, who has appeared wearing a space-suit under a headline 'Galactic' in one of the numerous special supplements published ahead of the game.

With Ronaldo grabbing centre-stage ahead of Saturday's clash, journalists were quick to attribute a stomach bug suffered by Real keeper Bodo Illgner to 'Ronaldo-mania'.

It was a charge that Illgner, who has fully recovered, brushed aside.

"I've faced up to Maradona," said the former German international.

On a more serious note Real's Montenegrin striker Predrag Mijatovic has been hit by a personal crisis after his young son had to undergo an emergency operation on Wednesday evening.

Despite being up all night, Mijatovic returned to training the next day and was cheered by over 1,000 fans who had endured intense cold to watch their heroes.

Other fans braved the inclement weather for over 80 hours to ensure a ticket for the big game, which has created almost as much expectation in Spain as the long weekend created by Friday's public holiday.

The patient supporters were buoyed by appearences from Brazilian full-back Roberto Carlos, and Real chairman Lorenzo Sanz, who made a 1.30 am visit armed with coffee and sandwiches.

With black-market tickets reaching as much as 90,000 pesetas ($687) police were forced to restore order by ejecting 30 people from the queue as a struggle broke out to get to the ticket windows.

One young man who offered his tickets in exchange for a job was rewarded by being offered a trial by a computing company, as well as being allowed to keep the tickets. Such is the interest surrounding the Real-Barca clash that it wouldn't be surprising to hear of somebody offering their job in exchange for tickets.
