DUBLIN 1996-12-06

Former Ireland hooker and captain Terry Kingston has announced his retirement from representative rugby union.

"I had a most enjoyable career but the time has come for me to step aside from the representative scene. I want to devote more time to my job," Kingston said.

Kingston, 33, is a director of a computer accessories and systems company in his native Cork in southern Ireland.

He won 29 caps and had the distinction of playing in all three World Cup tournaments, captaining Ireland in South Africa last year.

Kingston played his last match for Irish provincial side Munster against Australia last month.
