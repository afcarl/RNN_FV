RUGBY UNION-SPRINGBOKS WARY OF HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF.

South Africa will be wary of recent French history when they seek to defend their series lead in the second and final test at Parc des Princes on Saturday.

A weakened French side crashed to a 22-12 defeat in the first test in Bordeaux last Saturday against a Springbok team, unchanged this weekend for a record fourth test in succession, but the home side have a proud tradition of fighting back in such circumstances.

Against New Zealand in 1986, Australia in 1989 and South Africa on the Springbok's last tour in 1992, France have always bounced back from losing the first test to win the second and square the series.

Springbok coach Andre Markgraaff admitted: "What happened in 1992 will put us on our guard. The French have not swallowed the defeat in Bordeaux and they will be looking for revenge."

Four years ago, France lost 20-15 in Lyon, but then crushed the Springboks 29-16 at their favourite Parc des Princes.

Wing James Small said: "At Parc des Princes it will be terrible this time. The French are likely to kick their penalties and we will perhaps not have the luck of the first test when the referee gave us a try that wasn't."

Television replays showed full-back Andre Joubert did not touch the ball down when he was tackled by wing Richard Dourthe as he raced over for South Africa's second try.

France have made eight changes from the first test team -- itself makeshift after injuries to several key players -- six in personnel and two more positional.

Experienced lock Olivier Merle, who has recovered from a rib injury, has been recalled to bolster a heavier pack aimed at countering the Springboks' strengths which lie principally in their forwards.

Merle said he had watched in frustration as a South African team French observers deem beatable won in Bordeaux.

He said: "I was very frustrated. I was disappointed to see this Springbok team, definitely beatable, was not beaten.

"I said to myself it's a shame this (French) group, put together at the last minute because of injuries, did not have enough time to prepare."

But he warned against expecting him to be the saviour. "You can't single out one player over another. Rugby is a team game above all."

French coach Jean-Claude Skrela has also given a first cap to 28-year-old Bourgoin winger Laurent Leflamand, and picked wing David Venditti, flyhalf Christophe Lamaison, scrumhalf Guy Accoceberry and hooker Marc Dal Maso.

Dourthe switches from wing to centre while captain Abdelatif Benazzi moves from flanker to number eight.

Markgraaff was able to name an unchanged side after Joubert recovered from a slight thigh injury in training and hooker James Dalton is fit again after having to come off with a bruised shoulder during the first test.

The World Cup holders, who go on to Cardiff afterwards for one test against Wales next weekend, could remain unbeaten in their five internationals on a three-country tour which started in Argentina.

But two defeats for their second string in France, which has sowed seeds of doubt among the French about the Springboks' strength in depth, have dented the tour record.
