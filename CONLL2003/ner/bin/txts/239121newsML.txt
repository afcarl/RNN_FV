SOCCER-SPANISH FIRST DIVISION MATCHES THIS WEEKEND.

MADRID 1996-12-06

Games scheduled for this weekend in the Spanish first division (current league standings in brackets):

Saturday:

    Real Madrid (1) vs Barcelona (2)	 kick-off 1930 gmt

Spain's two biggest clubs dispute the top spot in the league in a game which has excited a degree of interest remarkable even for an 'old firm' game.

Sunday:

    Extremadura (22) vs Valladolid (8)		  1600

Valladolid will be without four first-choice players, amongst them Croatian striker Alen Peternac, for the visit to struggling Extremadura, who are themselves hit by injuries.

    Celta Vigo (12) vs Sporting Gijon (16)	    1600

Sporting coach Benito Floro, who badly needs a win to keep his job, can take heart from Celta's poor home record and from the injuries to five of the home side's staring line-up.

    Deportivo Coruna (3) vs Valencia (11)	     1600

Deportivo's Brazilian midfield general Rivaldo is doubtful for the game against a Valencia side which could be feeling the effects of Tuesday's UEFA Cup game in Istanbul.

    Real Betis (4) vs Logrones (17)		     1600

Betis, who have a habit of slipping up against weaker opponents, hope to make up ground on the leaders in what is theoretically the most one-sided game of the weekend.

    Rayo Vallecano (10) vs Compostela (20)	    1600

Coach Fernando Vazquez, who is fighting for his managerial life at Compostela, hopes for a result on a rain-affected and notoriously boggy Rayo pitch.

    Oviedo (15) vs Tenerife (13)			  1600

Tenerife have strikers Oliver Neuville and Meho Kodro back in their bid to follow up Tuesday's UEFA Cup win at Feyenoord with a repeat of the victories at Oviedo of the last two years.

    Espanyol (14) vs Zaragoza (18)			1600

Espanyol are struggling after five games without a win, while Zaragoza seem to have acquired new life with the appointment of new coach Victor Esparrago.

    Racing Santander (9) vs Real Sociedad (7)	 1600

Racing, who tend to be weak at home, are without injured midfielder Esteban Torre. Striker Inigo Idiakez is back from injury for Real.

    Athletic Bilbao (6) vs Atletico Madrid (5)	1830

Atletico's injured playmaker Jose Luis Caminero will miss this weekend's other big game, which puts together Spain's most in-form sides and will be Josu Urrutia's 200th match for Bilbao.

Monday:

    Hercules (21) vs Sevilla (19)			 2030

A relegation struggle -- newly-promoted Hercules have already sacked a second coach this season, while Sevilla rejected Jose Antonio Camacho's resignation last week.
