<title>SPAIN: SOCCER-SPANISH FIRST DIVISION MATCHES THIS WEEKEND.</title>
<headline>SOCCER-SPANISH FIRST DIVISION MATCHES THIS WEEKEND.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Games scheduled for this weekend in the Spanish first division (current league standings in brackets):</p>
<p>Saturday:</p>
<p>    Real Madrid (1) vs Barcelona (2)	 kick-off 1930 gmt</p>
<p>Spain's two biggest clubs dispute the top spot in the league in a game which has excited a degree of interest remarkable even for an 'old firm' game.</p>
<p>Sunday:</p>
<p>    Extremadura (22) vs Valladolid (8)		  1600</p>
<p>Valladolid will be without four first-choice players, amongst them Croatian striker Alen Peternac, for the visit to struggling Extremadura, who are themselves hit by injuries.</p>
<p>    Celta Vigo (12) vs Sporting Gijon (16)	    1600</p>
<p>Sporting coach Benito Floro, who badly needs a win to keep his job, can take heart from Celta's poor home record and from the injuries to five of the home side's staring line-up.</p>
<p>    Deportivo Coruna (3) vs Valencia (11)	     1600</p>
<p>Deportivo's Brazilian midfield general Rivaldo is doubtful for the game against a Valencia side which could be feeling the effects of Tuesday's UEFA Cup game in Istanbul.</p>
<p>    Real Betis (4) vs Logrones (17)		     1600</p>
<p>Betis, who have a habit of slipping up against weaker opponents, hope to make up ground on the leaders in what is theoretically the most one-sided game of the weekend.</p>
<p>    Rayo Vallecano (10) vs Compostela (20)	    1600</p>
<p>Coach Fernando Vazquez, who is fighting for his managerial life at Compostela, hopes for a result on a rain-affected and notoriously boggy Rayo pitch.</p>
<p>    Oviedo (15) vs Tenerife (13)			  1600</p>
<p>Tenerife have strikers Oliver Neuville and Meho Kodro back in their bid to follow up Tuesday's UEFA Cup win at Feyenoord with a repeat of the victories at Oviedo of the last two years.</p>
<p>    Espanyol (14) vs Zaragoza (18)			1600</p>
<p>Espanyol are struggling after five games without a win, while Zaragoza seem to have acquired new life with the appointment of new coach Victor Esparrago.</p>
<p>    Racing Santander (9) vs Real Sociedad (7)	 1600</p>
<p>Racing, who tend to be weak at home, are without injured midfielder Esteban Torre. Striker Inigo Idiakez is back from injury for Real.</p>
<p>    Athletic Bilbao (6) vs Atletico Madrid (5)	1830</p>
<p>Atletico's injured playmaker Jose Luis Caminero will miss this weekend's other big game, which puts together Spain's most in-form sides and will be Josu Urrutia's 200th match for Bilbao.</p>
<p>Monday:</p>
<p>    Hercules (21) vs Sevilla (19)			 2030</p>
<p>A relegation struggle -- newly-promoted Hercules have already sacked a second coach this season, while Sevilla rejected Jose Antonio Camacho's resignation last week.</p>
