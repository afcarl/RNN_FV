<p>Italian Serie A games to be played on Sunday (league positions in parentheses, all kick- off times GMT):</p>
<p>Bologna (4) v Piacenza  (13)  1330</p>
<p>Along with leaders Vicenza, fourth-placed Bologna represent the biggest surprise of this Italian autumn. Led as usual by Swede Kennet Andersson and Russian Igor Kolyvanov in attack, Bologna can expect a tough home match against a Piacenza side still exultant after a 3-2 league win over AC Milan last Sunday.</p>
<p>Cagliari (16)  v Reggiana (18)  1530</p>
<p>Cagliari start favourite in this relegation scrap following draws with Napoli and Inter in last two outings but will be without suspended Swiss defender Ramon Vega. Bottom team Reggiana are also without a suspended defender, German Dietmar Beiersdorfer.</p>
<p>Fiorentina (10) v Perugia (8) 1330</p>
<p>Fiorentina will be without three suspended players -- defenders Daniele Carnasciali and Lorenzo Amoruso and midfielder Emiliano Bigica -- for a difficult home match against unpredictable, attack-oriented Perugia led by in-form Croat striker Milan Rapajic and the experienced Fausto Pizzi.</p>
<p>Lazio (12)  v AS Roma (7)  1930</p>
<p>Poor man's Roman derby in what has been a miserable season for both Rome teams, already eliminated from the Italian and UEFA Cups. Lazio have injury doubts about striker Pierluigi Casiraghi, Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved and defender Paolo Negro, while Roma present a full strength side led by Argentine Abel Balbo, Marco Delvecchio and Francesco Totti in attack.</p>
<p>AC Milan (9) v Udinese (11) 1330</p>
<p>Can Milan sink any further?  Following their midweek Champions' League elimination by Norwegian side Rosenborg, a morale-boosting win is badly needed. Liberian striker George Weah makes a welcome return for Milan alongside Roberto Baggio, with Montenegrin Dejan Savicevic in midfield. Good news for Milan is that Udinese's German striker Oliver Bierhoff is out through injury.</p>
<p>Napoli (5) v Verona (17) 1330</p>
<p>In-form Napoli should prove too strong for second from bottom Verona despite the absence of their suspended Argentine defender Roberto Ayala. Verona's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder Eugenio Corini.</p>
<p>Parma (14) v Atlalanta (15) 1330</p>
<p>Parma may field new signing, Croat midfielder Mario Stanic, in an attempt to lift a miserable season which has seen them go without a win since a 1-0 triumph over Cagliari eight weeks ago. Parma's French midfielder Daniel Bravo and defender Fabio Cannavaro are suspended while Argentine Nestor Sensini is out through injury. Atalanta look to Filippo Inzaghi, scorer of eight goals.</p>
<p>Sampdoria (6) v Juventus (3) 1330</p>
<p>All-conquering Juventus field their most recent signing, Portuguese defender Dimas, while Alessandro Del Piero and Croat Alen Boksic lead the attack. The new world club champions may prove too strong for a Sampdoria side led by captain Roberto Mancini but missing injured French midfielder Pierre Laigle.</p>
<p>Vicenza (1) v Internazionale (2) 1330</p>
<p>Not exactly a clash of the titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless. Full strength Vicenza, led by Uruguayan Marcelo Otero, may continue their surprise run at the top against an Inter side that has been less than impressive in three successive home draws. Inter will be without suspended French defender Joceyln Angloma and injured Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano.</p>
