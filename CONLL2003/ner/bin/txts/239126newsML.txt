SOCCER-FIFA BOSS SEES TROUBLE AT 2002 WORLD CUP.

ROME 1996-12-06

FIFA chairman Joao Havelange hit out on Friday over the headaches of staging the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea, saying the split was a political decision and politics never suited sport.

In an interview with the Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, soccer's top official also confirmed that FIFA could pull football out of the Olympics after a perceived snub to world soccer's governing body at this year's Atlanta Games.

"Everyone knows by now that organising (the World Cup) jointly between Korea and Japan was an international political decision," Havelange was quoted as saying.

"But what is good for politics is almost always bad for sport," he said in Barcelona, where FIFA's executive committee is due to meet at the weekend.

Its 33-point agenda will include the 2002 World Cup, at which Japan will host the final and South Korea the opening match.

Havelange, a Brazilian, said the tournament was proving an organisational problem.

"How do you divide up the teams? Everybody is going to want to see Brazil, Italy, Argentina and Germany and maybe even Nigeria," he said.

"It's not going to be easy to strike a balance in the draw for the groups. And where do you organise it (the draw)? Perhaps we should do it on a boat in the sea that separates the two countries."

FIFA's executive committee will also consider a proposal to abolish the Olympic soccer tournament, which predates the World Cup by 30 years, and instead introduce an under-23 world championship.

Throwing his weight behind the idea, Havelange said soccer had gained nothing in financial terms from the Atlanta Games.

"If it continues to be marginalised, yes," Havelange said when asked if soccer could go from the Olympic programme.

"The tournament in the United States was played everywhere except in Atlanta, not even one match there. Soccer pulled in 1.4 million spectators, more than the other sports put together and it got nothing in return."

Havelange said the proposed under-23 tournament would be played among 24 or 32 teams in the year before the Olympics "and not necessarily in the same country".

"The best 16 would qualify for the Games. In that way, under FIFA's management, you could earn money to share out among all the participants. And the Olympics would also have its soccer tournament but with the dignity of other team sports," he said.
