SOCCER-VICENZA MEET INTER IN TOP-OF-TABLE CLASH.

ROME 1996-12-06

Vicenza, Italy's surprise league leaders, aim to stretch their advantage when they entertain nearest rivals Internazionale on Sunday.

Vicenza are one point ahead of Inter, with Juventus and Bologna a further point behind.

Since taking the lead two weeks ago, Vicenza have played down their championship prospects.

"I don't want to denigrate my side's achievement but I'm a realist and I know that the really strong sides in this championship have yet to play to their best," coach Francesco Guidolin said.

But they are unbeaten in seven league games and recently eliminated AC Milan from the Italian Cup, so they are very much the team in form.

Inter, by contrast, disappointed their fans in their last three league games in which they were held to draws by Fiorentina, AC Milan and Cagliari.

Inter central defender Massimo Paganin acknowledged that Sunday's game represented a crucial test for his side's overall championship prospects.

"Good, on Sunday we'll see if our recent draws were just the result of having played too many league and cup matches," he said.

"This is an important test. It will be a very tactical match between two sides who play a very tight, close game."

Vicenza will be at full strength, with Uruguayan Marcelo Otero leading the attack alongside Roberto Murgita and former Lazio strikerAlessandro Iannuzzi.

Inter will be without suspended French defender Jocelyn Angloma and injured Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano.

Marco Branca joins Frenchman Youri Djorkaeff in attack and experienced Giuseppe Bergomi replaces Angloma in defence.
