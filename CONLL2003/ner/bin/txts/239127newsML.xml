<p>Vicenza, Italy's surprise league leaders, aim to stretch their advantage when they entertain nearest rivals Internazionale on Sunday.</p>
<p>Vicenza are one point ahead of Inter, with Juventus and Bologna a further point behind.</p>
<p>Since taking the lead two weeks ago, Vicenza have played down their championship prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to denigrate my side's achievement but I'm a realist and I know that the really strong sides in this championship have yet to play to their best,&quot; coach Francesco Guidolin said.</p>
<p>But they are unbeaten in seven league games and recently eliminated AC Milan from the Italian Cup, so they are very much the team in form.</p>
<p>Inter, by contrast, disappointed their fans in their last three league games in which they were held to draws by Fiorentina, AC Milan and Cagliari.</p>
<p>Inter central defender Massimo Paganin acknowledged that Sunday's game represented a crucial test for his side's overall championship prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;Good, on Sunday we'll see if our recent draws were just the result of having played too many league and cup matches,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an important test. It will be a very tactical match between two sides who play a very tight, close game.&quot;</p>
<p>Vicenza will be at full strength, with Uruguayan Marcelo Otero leading the attack alongside Roberto Murgita and former Lazio strikerAlessandro Iannuzzi.</p>
<p>Inter will be without suspended French defender Jocelyn Angloma and injured Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano.</p>
<p>Marco Branca joins Frenchman Youri Djorkaeff in attack and experienced Giuseppe Bergomi replaces Angloma in defence.</p>
