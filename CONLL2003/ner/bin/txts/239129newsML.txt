SOCCER-HENRY IS FRANCE'S LATEST SOCCER PRODIGY.

The growing appetite of top European clubs for French players has brought the name of Monaco teenager Thierry Henry on to the list of most wanted players.

The successes of Marcel Desailly at AC Milan, Didier Deschamps at Juventus, Eric Cantona at Manchester United and David Ginola at Newcastle have made French players the most sought after in Europe and Henry is the latest in line.

Real Madrid have already approached the team from the principality for the 19-year-old striker, even though he has played few full matches in the first division this season.

But his second half appearances in the French league have been enough for him to score eight goals and he has netted a further four in the UEFA Cup.

For many, he is, the French player of the future, more so than other prospects such as Arsenal's Patrick Vieira or the two youngsters who have already made their way into the national squad -- Florian Maurice or Robert Pires.

The interest in the under-21 international, brought up in the Parisian working class suburb of Les Ullis, may look a bit premature.

But Monaco took a chance on him two years ago after hearing he had scored six goals in a fourth division match.

Tall -- 1.95 metres -- and fast, Henry has a lot in common with Vieira, who is a year older than him.

But he said he did not want to jump the gun as he felt Vieira did when joining AC Milan last season, ending up playing little for the former European champions.

"I had never imagined that things could go that fast. Only two years ago I was playing with the under 17s. I thought I would have to learn my trade with Monaco's reserves," he said.

"But I'm aware everything could stop at once. Everybody tells me to be careful and I will be."

His coaches have a lot of confidence in Henry, who had been spotted by many athletics clubs as a potential sprint champion.

France's under-21 manager Raymond Domenech said he thought the young prodigy was clever enough to make it to the top.

"He has Patrick Vieira's experience to help him. I'm sure he can work from that. It is intelligence, not talent, that brings a player to the very best level," he said.

Monaco's coach Jean Tigana is convinced he has discovered a gem and has tried to protect him from temptation.

To shield Henry, Tigana has so far been reluctant to field him from the start of a game and has asked journalists to leave him alone.

"He still wants to improve my game because I still have some weaknesses. I tend to lose my self control when I find myself alone in front of a goalkeeper. I still lose too many of those duels," Henry said.

Tigana said another reason why he was only using Henry in the last half hour of a match was to take full advantage of his speed at a time when the opposition defence was tired out.

From the dull surroundings of Les Ullis to the luxuries of the principality, Henry has gone a long way. But he thought he had not changed for the worse.

"I'm not living the life of a youngster. I can't go out partying like my friends of Les Ullis. But I'm keeping in touch with them to avoid getting a big head," said the young player, who sports timid dreadlocks.

"I hope to be an example for some. I was lucky to be gifted for football because I was not for studies".
