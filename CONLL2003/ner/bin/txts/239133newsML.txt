KWV MEMBERS FAVOUR MOVES TO CONVERT TO FIRM.

CAPE TOWN 1996-12-06

KWV Investments Ltd's 4,571 wine farmer members have voted overwhelmingly in favour of converting the wine co-operative into a company by the end of April next year, KWV said on Friday.

In a statement, it said that during a special ballot held in the various KWV districts, 83.8 percent of its members voted in favour of converting to a company.

Only 0.35 percent of members who voted had been aginst the change.

The decision will, however, have to be ratified by the Supreme Court and a hearing is scheduled for December 12 in the Cape Town Supreme Court.

The move to transform the co-operative into a company was announced by chairman Lourens Jonker at a special mass meeting of 1,000 farmers in Paarl in October.

He said in the statement that the move was "the most important and determining matter affecting the South African wine farmer since the establishment of KWV in 1918."

"The positive result of the ballot came as no surprise because the industry had already demonstrated its solidarity and enthusiastic support at the mass meeting," Jonker said.

He said several other initiatives which would position KWV more favourably with regard to its shareholders and other interested parties in the South African and foreign communities had also been taken.

The new company would be known as KWV Group Ltd but Jonker said all KWV's existing industry responsibilities with regard to industry administration and stabilisation would remain in place.

In a separate statement, KWV announced that it had been decided to keep the base price for good wine and distilling wine unchanged at 73 cents per litre.

"It is expected that favourable market conditions will prevail in 1997 that could adjust prices upwards due to market forces," it said.
