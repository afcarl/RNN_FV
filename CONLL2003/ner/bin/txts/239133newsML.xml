<p>KWV Investments Ltd's 4,571 wine farmer members have voted overwhelmingly in favour of converting the wine co-operative into a company by the end of April next year, KWV said on Friday.</p>
<p>In a statement, it said that during a special ballot held in the various KWV districts, 83.8 percent of its members voted in favour of converting to a company.</p>
<p>Only 0.35 percent of members who voted had been aginst the change.</p>
<p>The decision will, however, have to be ratified by the Supreme Court and a hearing is scheduled for December 12 in the Cape Town Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The move to transform the co-operative into a company was announced by chairman Lourens Jonker at a special mass meeting of 1,000 farmers in Paarl in October.</p>
<p>He said in the statement that the move was &quot;the most important and determining matter affecting the South African wine farmer since the establishment of KWV in 1918.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The positive result of the ballot came as no surprise because the industry had already demonstrated its solidarity and enthusiastic support at the mass meeting,&quot; Jonker said.</p>
<p>He said several other initiatives which would position KWV more favourably with regard to its shareholders and other interested parties in the South African and foreign communities had also been taken.</p>
<p>The new company would be known as KWV Group Ltd but Jonker said all KWV's existing industry responsibilities with regard to industry administration and stabilisation would remain in place.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, KWV announced that it had been decided to keep the base price for good wine and distilling wine unchanged at 73 cents per litre.</p>
<p>&quot;It is expected that favourable market conditions will prevail in 1997 that could adjust prices upwards due to market forces,&quot; it said.</p>
