SOUTH AFRICA RAND/BONDS CLOSING REPORT.

JOHANNESBURG 1996-12-06

South African bonds were left relatively unscathed on Friday by the selloff on world financial markets triggered by comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.

The key R150 ended the day at a 15.97 percent yield after settling at 15.86 percent on Thursday.

The R150 touched an intraday high of 16.02 percent in the afternoon session following a selloff of U.S. Treasuries which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to a four-week high of 6.61 percent.

Greenspan said in a speech on Thursday that the Fed had to be wary when "irrational exuberance" infected stocks and other asset markets because they could end up damaging the economy.

Analysts said his comments had revived fears about the outlook for interest rates and inflation into 1997, which sent financial markets spiralling around the globe.

The release of better-than-expected U.S. November employment data helped calm the market, however, and both overseas and local financial markets retraced from their weakest levels.

Dealers said the local market had initially gapped on the back of the U.S. market's weakness and on fears of a selloff on Wall Street at its 1430 GMT opening.

"We have just been following the trend of the U.S. market today," a trader said.

Some traders felt, however, that the local bond market had shown resilience on the day.

One noted that a batch of negative local statistics had failed to faze the bond market at all this week.

Both local and offshore buyers appeared keen to buy the market above the psychological 16 percent mark.

"But it's not over yet...it's the flip of a coin," a dealer said, adding that Wall Street's reaction to Greenspan would dictate direction in the short-term.

Trade on the currency market was relatively subdued as both importers and exporters kept the rand in a tight range.

At the finish it was quoted at 4.6570/6620 against the dollar after settling at 4.6750/6800 on Thursday.

"Nothing much has happened today...all the action has been on the bond and equities," a dealer said.

Trader said there had been both importer demand at the 4.6550 level and exporters selling above the 4.66 level which kept the currency confined in a narrow range for the day.

Dealers said a test of the 4.68 level, which held well during the week, appeared likely again next week although the Reserve Bank was expected to offer support to the currency if that level was breached.

Against the crosses, the rand was quoted at 7.6591/6697 against sterling from 7.5807/5935 previously and at 0.3296/3300 marks from 0.3323/3328 on Thursday.

On the money market, three-month NCD rates were pegged at between 17.15 and 17.20 percent offered, up from 17.10 to 17.15 percent on Thursday, while the 90-day BA rate was also quoted in a higher 16.50 to 16.75 percent range from 16.40 to 16.65 percent on Thursday.

The Reserve Bank indicated the money market shortage at 9.269 billion rand on Thursday from 9.739 billion rand on Wednesday.

Bond Exchange statistics showed foreigners were net buyers of local bonds worth 47.88 million rand on Thursday after selling 32.79 million on Wednesday.

Nominal cumulative volumes were pegged at 37.16 billion rand on Thursday -- a settlement date -- from 3.62 billion rand previously.
