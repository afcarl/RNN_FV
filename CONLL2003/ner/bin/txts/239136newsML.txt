ZIMBABWE DOLLAR ENDS WEEK EASIER ON HARD UNITS.

HARARE 1996-12-06

The Zimbabwe dollar ended the week on Friday softer on hard currencies after a rather dull interbank session, foreign exchange dealers said.

"We haven't seen anything happen today. The market has been rather quiet," commented one.

He said the local unit's half cent loss against the U.S. dollar had been caused largely by banks quoting high to protect their positions following the central Reserve Bank's intervention late Thursday to mop up excess foreign currency in the market.

At Friday's close, the Zimbabwe dollar was trading at 10.7550/7750 against the U.S. unit from 10.7500/7700 overnight and also weakened to 17.6880/7310 from 17.4200/4600 versus pound sterling, tracking a softer U.S. dollar overseas.

It was at 7.0190/0370 from 6.8950/9130 against the mark and at 2.3060/3130 on the rand, down from 2.2950/3030 the previous day.
