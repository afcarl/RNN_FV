HARARE 1996-12-06

Zimbabwe's money market opened liquid on Friday with short-term trading rates quoted softer in brisk activity, dealers said.

"The market is very flush and very active. There's demand for long paper but the Reserve Bank is selling one-day treasury bills into the market today. Maybe they want to keep the money inside for a pending (government) stock issue," one dealer commented.

He said after Thursday's weekly tender, discount houses were now taking up treasury bills from the central bank at a lower 18.90 percent from 19 percent the previous week. The bills were being traded on the market at between 18.50 and 18.65 percent.

NCDs redeemable after 30, 60 and 90 days were also quoted easier at 20 percent from 21 percent (buying) and 19 percent from 19.25 percent (selling).

Bankers acceptance bills softened to 19.50 and 18.90 percent 19 percent (buying and selling respectively) from 20 and 19 percent and call money was quoted one percentage point lower at 18 percent.

Figures from the Reserve Bank indicated a market surplus of Z$265 million.
