ZIMBABWE DOLLAR WEAKER IN SLIGHTLY SHORT MARKET.

HARARE 1996-12-06

The Zimbabwe dollar was quoted weaker on hard currencies in Friday's slightly tight foreign exchange market but dealers predicted trade would be very slow during the day and rates were likely to hold to their present levels.

"The market is a bit short and people are quoting high to protect their positions. But its on the quiet side -- there is not much trading to write home about," one dealer said, adding most importers were probably taking a breather for Christmas.

At around 0745 GMT, the Zimbabwe dollar was trading at 10.7550/7750 against the U.S. dollar, half a cent down from 10.7500/7700 overnight and at opening, and was also weaker on sterling at 17.6540/6990 compared to 17.4200/4600, tracking a softer U.S. dollar overseas.

It was at 6.9910/7.0000 versus the mark, down from 6.8950/9130 and at 2.3050/3100 from 2.2950/3030 against the rand.
