<p>Czech President Vaclav Havel on Friday welcomed the appointment of Madeleine Albright, who is of Czech extraction, as the United States' first woman Secretary of State.</p>
<p>In a statement Havel, who is recovering from cancer surgery, said: &quot;Madeleine Albright is a distinguished friend, a tested diplomat, and a true American of fine origins.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I look forward to continuing our good relations...with the United States and with the first woman ever to hold the position of Secretary of State. I wish her well,&quot; Havel said in a statement to Reuters.</p>
<p>Havel, who helped lead the &quot;velvet revolution&quot; that ousted the Communist regime in Prague in 1989, invited Albright, then working for a private foreign policy think tank, to advise his new democratic government in 1990.</p>
<p>Havel had a small malignant tumour removed from his lung on Monday and is recovering in hospital.</p>
<p>Albright, born Marie Korbelova to a Czechoslovak diplomat in 1937, fled with her family to the United States after the Communists came to power in a coup in 1948.</p>
<p>As an academic, Albright studied and lectured on Europe's 20th century problems before becoming U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.</p>
<p>Czech diplomats, seeking to have their country included in the expected expansion of NATO, praised the selection of Albright, known to be a strong supporter of alliance's integration of former Soveit-bloc countries.</p>
<p>&quot;The nomination...is a clear signal that one key of the lines of foreign policy will be the strengthening of the trans-Atlantic cooperation, a creation of strategic partnership between Europe and the US,&quot; Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;(Albright) is a convinced advocate of NATO enlargement and of stabilisation of security structures.&quot;</p>
<p>Czech ambassador to the United Nations, Karel Kovanda, told the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes that Albright &quot;is a little light in our diplomatic heaven,&quot; but warned against expecting her to exert any influence in favour of the Czechs.</p>
