A bomb exploded early on Friday outside the home of a Slovak politician recently expelled from parliament after quitting the ruling party, but caused no injuries, police said.

Opposition deputies called the attack on the home of Frantisek Gaulieder -- who was stripped of his seat on Wednesday and said he had been receiving anonymous death threats -- an act of political terrorism.

The early morning explosion in Galanta, western Slovakia, blew out ground floor windows and damaged the main entrance of Galieder's home, police said.

Gaulieder quit Premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), which leads a nationalist-populist three-party coalition, on November 5 protesting against what he said was a lack of democratic conduct in the party.

He said he had been receiving anonymous death threats since leaving the party.

Opposition deputies on Friday demanded that parliament be informed of details of the explosion.

Colonel Jaroslav Varecka, head of the national criminal investigation department, reported to the chamber on Friday in the absence of interior minister Gustav Krajci, who was abroad,

"On November 21, Mr Gaulieder informed the police that on Novemvber 14 he had received an anonymous threat to his life," Varecka told parliament.

Gaulieder's family was sleeping at the back of the house when the blast occured just after midnight.

"This was an act of terrorism and now I fear not only for my own life, but also of that of my wife and children," Gaulieder told the official news agency TASR.

No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion.

"This explosion has a political dimension," Jan Carnogursky, leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) told parliament.

Vavrecka said police had set up a special investigating group to handle the case.

Olga Keltosova, deputy premier and HZDS deputy chairwoman indicated that the bomb attack against Gaulider could be seen as a move to discredit her party.

"We suspect that somebody has not hesitated to use such a barbaric act to throw a bad light on somebody else," Keltosova told the official TASR news agency. She said the HZDS condemned the act and called for an investigation of the case.

Since quitting HZDS, Gaulieder, a founding member of the party, repeatedly said he would not resign from parliament.

He said he would keep his seat in a letter last month to the chamber's president Ivan Gasparovic, also a HZDS member.

Last week Gasparovic said he had received a second letter from Gaulieder announcing that he was giving up his seat and had passed both letters to the parliamentary mandate committee.

Gaulieder denied sending the letter of resignation, and claimed the letter Gasparovic recevied was a forgery.

The opposition said Gauleider's expulsion from the chamber on Wednesday was unconstitutional and they would appeal to the constitutional court.
