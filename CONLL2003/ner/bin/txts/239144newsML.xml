<p>A bomb exploded early on Friday outside the home of a Slovak politician recently expelled from parliament after quitting the ruling party, but caused no injuries, police said.</p>
<p>Opposition deputies called the attack on the home of Frantisek Gaulieder -- who was stripped of his seat on Wednesday and said he had been receiving anonymous death threats -- an act of political terrorism.</p>
<p>The early morning explosion in Galanta, western Slovakia, blew out ground floor windows and damaged the main entrance of Galieder's home, police said.</p>
<p>Gaulieder quit Premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), which leads a nationalist-populist three-party coalition, on November 5 protesting against what he said was a lack of democratic conduct in the party.</p>
<p>He said he had been receiving anonymous death threats since leaving the party.</p>
<p>Opposition deputies on Friday demanded that parliament be informed of details of the explosion.</p>
<p>Colonel Jaroslav Varecka, head of the national criminal investigation department, reported to the chamber on Friday in the absence of interior minister Gustav Krajci, who was abroad,</p>
<p>&quot;On November 21, Mr Gaulieder informed the police that on Novemvber 14 he had received an anonymous threat to his life,&quot; Varecka told parliament.</p>
<p>Gaulieder's family was sleeping at the back of the house when the blast occured just after midnight.</p>
<p>&quot;This was an act of terrorism and now I fear not only for my own life, but also of that of my wife and children,&quot; Gaulieder told the official news agency TASR.</p>
<p>No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion.</p>
<p>&quot;This explosion has a political dimension,&quot; Jan Carnogursky, leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) told parliament.</p>
<p>Vavrecka said police had set up a special investigating group to handle the case.</p>
<p>Olga Keltosova, deputy premier and HZDS deputy chairwoman indicated that the bomb attack against Gaulider could be seen as a move to discredit her party.</p>
<p>&quot;We suspect that somebody has not hesitated to use such a barbaric act to throw a bad light on somebody else,&quot; Keltosova told the official TASR news agency. She said the HZDS condemned the act and called for an investigation of the case.</p>
<p>Since quitting HZDS, Gaulieder, a founding member of the party, repeatedly said he would not resign from parliament.</p>
<p>He said he would keep his seat in a letter last month to the chamber's president Ivan Gasparovic, also a HZDS member.</p>
<p>Last week Gasparovic said he had received a second letter from Gaulieder announcing that he was giving up his seat and had passed both letters to the parliamentary mandate committee.</p>
<p>Gaulieder denied sending the letter of resignation, and claimed the letter Gasparovic recevied was a forgery.</p>
<p>The opposition said Gauleider's expulsion from the chamber on Wednesday was unconstitutional and they would appeal to the constitutional court.</p>
