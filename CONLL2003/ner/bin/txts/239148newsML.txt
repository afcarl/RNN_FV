POLAND MAY OPEN BOND MANAGER TENDER IN JAN -FINMIN.

WARSAW 1996-12-06

Poland is likely to announce a tender for a lead manager of the 1997 planned international bond issue next month, a deputy finance minister said on Friday.

"The tender (for a lead manager) will likely be announced in January," Krzysztof Kalicki told Reuters in an interview.

Kalicki said the ministry was considering a samurai bond and a yankee bond issues but has yet to decide on the size of the issue and pick the market for it.

"Our strategy is to enter new markets with relatively small bond issues. I think that we will want to issue bonds on the U.S. market but we are also considering an issue on the Japanese market," he said.

The budget draft for 1997, now debated by parliamentary committees, sets the upper limit for international bond issues at $500 million but Kalicki said it would depend on market conditions where and how much of the bonds would be offered.

"Everything will depend on which market will offer better conditions, now it is still open whether it will be an issue on one market or two markets," Kalicki added.

Poland so far has succesfully completed two eurobond issues.

Last year it offered a 250-million-mark bond at 65 basis points above comparable German bunds and in 1995 it returned to international market with a $250 million bond sold at 188 basis points above comparable U.S. T-bonds.

Poland's long-term sovereign debt now has a BBB- rating from Standard & Poor's, BBB from IBCA and Baa3 from Moody's.
