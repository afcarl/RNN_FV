<p>Poland is likely to announce a tender for a lead manager of the 1997 planned international bond issue next month, a deputy finance minister said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The tender (for a lead manager) will likely be announced in January,&quot; Krzysztof Kalicki told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Kalicki said the ministry was considering a samurai bond and a yankee bond issues but has yet to decide on the size of the issue and pick the market for it.</p>
<p>&quot;Our strategy is to enter new markets with relatively small bond issues. I think that we will want to issue bonds on the U.S. market but we are also considering an issue on the Japanese market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The budget draft for 1997, now debated by parliamentary committees, sets the upper limit for international bond issues at $500 million but Kalicki said it would depend on market conditions where and how much of the bonds would be offered.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything will depend on which market will offer better conditions, now it is still open whether it will be an issue on one market or two markets,&quot; Kalicki added.</p>
<p>Poland so far has succesfully completed two eurobond issues.</p>
<p>Last year it offered a 250-million-mark bond at 65 basis points above comparable German bunds and in 1995 it returned to international market with a $250 million bond sold at 188 basis points above comparable U.S. T-bonds.</p>
<p>Poland's long-term sovereign debt now has a BBB- rating from Standard &amp; Poor's, BBB from IBCA and Baa3 from Moody's.</p>
