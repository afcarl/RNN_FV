POLISH CREDIT ACTION RISE TOO QUICK - CENTRAL BANK.

WARSAW 1996-12-06

The National Bank of Poland signalled on Friday that credit action was growing faster than needed by the economy, a senior central bank official said.

"Credit action is too big from the point of view of the economy's needs," Jacek Osinski, deputy head of the central bank's monetary policy department, told a group of bankers.

Osinski suggested the recent boom in credit action was the main cause of the Polish money market's cash shortage, which pulled market rates up to lombard rate levels this week.

The head of the NBP's monetary policy department Jerzy Stopyra, also present, said real interest rates would rise next year as credit action was growing faster than deposits in 1996.

"The growth rate of deposits in the banking system is less dynamic than that of credit action," Stopyra said .

Credit to the non-financial sector rose by 34.7 percent from the start of the year to November 20, while zloty deposits increased by 27.4 percent and foreign currency deposits of the non-financial sector rose by 7.2 percent.

Osinski said deposit rates in some Polish banks fell too deeply in recent months and along with fast growing credit action was paring down the banking system's overliquidity.

He reiterated that the Polish money market, which has been overliquid for the last several years, would start losing its excess funds next year.

"A cash-shortage on the (Polish) market may become more typical," Osinski said.

He said repo operations between Polish commercial banks would likely become more common next year and increase the market's liquidity in 1997. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700
