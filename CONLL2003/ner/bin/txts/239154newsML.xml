<p>The National Bank of Poland will keep its monetary policy tight next year to help bring down inflation even if it results in slowing economic growth, the head of the central bank's monetary policy Jerzy Stopyra said.</p>
<p>&quot;Monetary policy will be tight and I don't rule out that one of its consequences may be a slow down of economic growth,&quot; Stopyra told a group of Polish bankers on Friday.  </p>
<p>Stopyra said the NBP would focus its monetary policy on achieving next year's inflation target of pushing year-on-year price growth down to 13 percent at year-end from 19.5 in October 1996.</p>
<p>He said the planned 1997 budget deficit, at 2.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), made such a deep cut in inflation difficult to reach.</p>
<p>Stopyra reiterated that the central bank aimed to keep real interest rates rising next year and said it was not clear whether nominal rates, now at 25 and 22 percent, would have to be increased.  </p>
<p>&quot;Right now we don't know whether the realisation of the operational target (reserve money) and the pace of broad money growth will make a nominal interest rate rise neccessary,&quot; he said. &quot;But in real terms, rates will grow,&quot; Stopyra added.</p>
<p>Poland's GDP is expected to grow about 5.5 percent this year and next year after a seven percent rise in 1995.</p>
<p>Stopyra also said that the central bank would keep its crawling peg devaluation mechanism for the zloty next year.</p>
<p>&quot;One thing is certain, we will keep the crawling peg mechanism but how will it be used is still under discussion,&quot;</p>
<p>Presently the zloty is devaluated by one percent per month against a basket of five western currencies.</p>
<p>In its 1997 monetary policy outline the central bank assumed a crawling nine percent devaluation of the centre of the zloty's daily trading band.</p>
