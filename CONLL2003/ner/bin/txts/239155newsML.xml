<p>Moldova's parliament has passed the 1997 budget in a first reading but said some economic forecasts by the government were unrealistic.</p>
<p>&quot;I consider some of the basic figures put in the draft 1997 budget unrealistic,&quot; Gheorghe Rusu, head of the parliamentary commission on budget and finance, told the deputies when the budget was passed.</p>
<p>Rusu said the budget deficit next year could be bigger than the targeted 350 million lei ($96,900), or three percent of Moldova's gross domestic product, which the government expects to rise to 11.8 billion lei.</p>
<p>The 1995 budget deficit was 4.9 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>This year's gap currently stands at over six percent because GDP is contracting instead of growing at 7.7 percent as planned.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Bank estimates GDP to be just 9.8 billion, so the expected growth of GDP is unrealistic,&quot; Rusu said.</p>
<p>But Rusu voted for the budget in the end, and deputies said it could receive the other two readings required before it is passed by the year-end.</p>
<p>Parliament agreed revenues of 1.88 billion lei and expenditure of 2.23 billion lei.</p>
<p>&quot;The task was to adopt the main economic document of the year...If some of the government's macroeconomic forecasts do not come true, parliament will revise and adjust the budget,&quot; deputy Alexandru Muravschi told reporters.</p>
<p>To finance the budget gap, the government plans to raise 150 million lei from issues of government securities. National Bank credits to the government will total 50 million, and loans from abroad are likely to bring in another 150 million lei.</p>
<p>The government expects annual inflation to fall further in 1997 to 13 percent from some 17 percent expected this year. The National Bank puts next year's inflation at 10 percent.</p>
<p>But Moldova's relative financial stability, which has been praised by the International Monetary Fund, may be shattered by fast-growing foreign debt which has reached $700 million so far.</p>
<p>&quot;By 1998, foreign debt may reach over $900 million,&quot; Rusu said.</p>
<p>Servicing domestic and external debt is expected to cost Moldova 518 million lei, or 23.2 percent of 1997 spending.</p>
<p>Work on the budget was delayed by presidential elections last month which were won by parliamentary speaker Petru Lucinschi. Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli has announced his government will resign to allow Lucinschi to appoint a new cabinet. REUTER</p>
