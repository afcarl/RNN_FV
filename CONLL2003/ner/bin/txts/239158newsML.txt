CZECH STEEL SEES LOWER 1996 GROSS PROFIT.

PRAGUE 1996-12-06

Czech steel maker Nova Hut a.s. on Friday said it expected its 1996 gross profit to fall to 700 million crowns from 1.1 billion in the previous year.

"This year's profit should be roughly half of what was originally expected," said Lumir Kuchar, assistant to the firm's general director told Reuters.

He did not give a reason for the drop.  

He gave no other expected year-end figures for the firm.

The state asset holding agency, the National Property Fund (NPF), holds a 70 percent stake in the mill.

Under a privatisation deal, the management was given a one percent stake and an option to get more after five years if it succeeds in restructuring the firm.

Nova Hut shares, which are listed on the parallel market of the Prague Stock Exchange, gained one crown on Friday to close at 453.
