BULGARIA LEV HITS NEW LOWS ON HIGH DOLLAR DEMAND.

SOFIA 1996-12-06

The Bulgarian lev slumped to a new record low of 465-469 per dollar in the afternoon from 435-450 in the morning, as foreign currency demand heavily topped supply on the interbank market, dealers said.

"Fuel and energy importers continue bidding for large foreign currency volumes but dollar liquidity of the market is excessively low," a commercial bank dealer said.

"Trade has been almost nil after some banks left the market in early afternoon in anticipation of new lows for the lev and dollar supply shrank further," another trader said.

The dollar was bid at 460-470 levs and was offered at 490-500 levs around 1430 local time (1230 GMT).

The central bank (BNB) was not seen meeting part of the dollar demand today, dealers said.

Central bank officials were not available for comment.

Foreign currency demand from energy importers strongly pressured the lev amid low supply this week with the central bank unable to halt the fall through large-scale interventions due to a fall in its foreign exchange reserves, dealers said.

The lev traded at 362-364 on Monday.

The BNB said last month it would aim to preserve reserves for a possible introduction of a tight monetary regime, called a currency board, under which levs in circulation must be matched by the amount of forex reserves.

Reserves fell by to $525 million at the end of November from $541 million a month earlier. Reserves stood at $1.41 billion in November 1995. -- Anastas Petrov, Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-876032
