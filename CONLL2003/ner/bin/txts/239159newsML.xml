<headline>BULGARIA LEV HITS NEW LOWS ON HIGH DOLLAR DEMAND.</headline>
<dateline>SOFIA 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>The Bulgarian lev slumped to a new record low of 465-469 per dollar in the afternoon from 435-450 in the morning, as foreign currency demand heavily topped supply on the interbank market, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuel and energy importers continue bidding for large foreign currency volumes but dollar liquidity of the market is excessively low,&quot; a commercial bank dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade has been almost nil after some banks left the market in early afternoon in anticipation of new lows for the lev and dollar supply shrank further,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>The dollar was bid at 460-470 levs and was offered at 490-500 levs around 1430 local time (1230 GMT).</p>
<p>The central bank (BNB) was not seen meeting part of the dollar demand today, dealers said.</p>
<p>Central bank officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>Foreign currency demand from energy importers strongly pressured the lev amid low supply this week with the central bank unable to halt the fall through large-scale interventions due to a fall in its foreign exchange reserves, dealers said.</p>
<p>The lev traded at 362-364 on Monday.</p>
<p>The BNB said last month it would aim to preserve reserves for a possible introduction of a tight monetary regime, called a currency board, under which levs in circulation must be matched by the amount of forex reserves.</p>
<p>Reserves fell by to $525 million at the end of November from $541 million a month earlier. Reserves stood at $1.41 billion in November 1995. -- Anastas Petrov, Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-876032</p>
