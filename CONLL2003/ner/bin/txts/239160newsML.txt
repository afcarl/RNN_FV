POLAND SAYS ALBRIGHT APPOINTMENT GOOD FOR NATO BID.

WARSAW 1996-12-06

Poland's foreign minister on Thursday welcomed Madeleine Albright's appointment as the United States' Secretary of State, saying the choice will help Poland's aspirations to join NATO.

"From our point of view it is a good candidacy. Ms Albright has been devoted to the idea of expansion of NATO," Dariusz Rosati told a news conference.

On Thursday Clinton named Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, as his choice for secretary of state.

Poland, along with the Czech Republic and Hungary, is seen as one of the first former Soviet bloc's countries to enter the Western military alliance.

The government hopes the pact will give a final go ahead next year to its enlargement, despite strong opposition from Russia, which says this would pose a threat to its security.

Albright visited Poland in early 1994, when she advanced President Bill Clinton's plan to create the so-called Partnership for Peace (PfP), which provided for joint military training between NATO members and their former Warsaw Pact foes.

Poland joined the PfP shortly afterwards and became one of its most active members.
