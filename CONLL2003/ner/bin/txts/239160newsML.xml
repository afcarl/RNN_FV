<p>Poland's foreign minister on Thursday welcomed Madeleine Albright's appointment as the United States' Secretary of State, saying the choice will help Poland's aspirations to join NATO.</p>
<p>&quot;From our point of view it is a good candidacy. Ms Albright has been devoted to the idea of expansion of NATO,&quot; Dariusz Rosati told a news conference.</p>
<p>On Thursday Clinton named Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, as his choice for secretary of state.</p>
<p>Poland, along with the Czech Republic and Hungary, is seen as one of the first former Soviet bloc's countries to enter the Western military alliance.</p>
<p>The government hopes the pact will give a final go ahead next year to its enlargement, despite strong opposition from Russia, which says this would pose a threat to its security.</p>
<p>Albright visited Poland in early 1994, when she advanced President Bill Clinton's plan to create the so-called Partnership for Peace (PfP), which provided for joint military training between NATO members and their former Warsaw Pact foes.</p>
<p>Poland joined the PfP shortly afterwards and became one of its most active members.</p>
