<title>BULGARIA: BULGARIA PARLIAMENT SUPPORTS BUDGET REVISION.</title>
<headline>BULGARIA PARLIAMENT SUPPORTS BUDGET REVISION.</headline>
<dateline>SOFIA 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Bulgaria's parliament on Friday approved at a first reading a budget revision including a 115 billion lev loan to the government to cover domestic debt payments, despite the central bank's opposition.</p>
<p>The bill will have a second reading next week. Parliament, in which the ruling Socialist party has a majority, approved it at the first reading by 121 votes to 95 with one abstention, state radio said.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) said on Thursday lending the government more money to finance the budget deficit was inappropriate as Bulgaria prepared to introduce a restrictive currency board regime and would further increase inflation.</p>
<p>The revision, this year's second, was sought by the government after it overshot the macroeconomic targets in the July revision.</p>
<p>The BNB suggested it would be less inflationary for the government to speed up long-heralded privatisations and channel some cash from the State Fund for Reconstruction and Development.</p>
<p>The government has issued large quantities of Treasury paper to raise cash and new issues now often find few buyers.</p>
<p>&quot;In the current stagnant market situation the government has no other source of funds except the loan from the central bank,&quot; Socialist deputy Fidel Kosev told parliament.</p>
<p>The opposition accused the government of deliberately fuelling inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;This government has brought the country to economic chaos and financial destabilisation through its inept rule,&quot; said opposition deputy Ventsislav Dimitrov.</p>
<p>Record high interest rates, currently 180 percent, mean domestic debt payments will reach 700 billion at the end of this year, or 75 percent of gross domestic product, said Finance Minister Dimitar Kostov.</p>
<p>The government wants the deficit target raised to 204.2 billion levs or five to six percent of GDP from 80.7 billion levs or 4.9 percent of GDP to meet higher domestic debt payments.</p>
<p>Apart from the central bank loan, the rest of the 123.5 billion lev deficit will be funded from tax revenue and government securities.</p>
<p>Under the revised budget, 117 billion levs are earmarked for interest and maturity payments on domestic debt which grew to 668.3 billion levs at the end of October from 345.4 billion levs at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Some 6.3 billion levs are slated for foreign debt payments.</p>
<p>Bulgaria is expected to introduce a currency board early next year, requiring levs in circulation to be matched by BNB reserves, removing political pressure to print money.</p>
<p>Next year's budget must be balanced between revenue and expenditure if a currency board is introduced, which will entail big cuts in public spending.</p>
