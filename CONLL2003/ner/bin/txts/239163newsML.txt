POLAND MAY RAISE FOREIGN OWNERSHIP CAP IN RADIO, TV.

WARSAW 1996-12-06

Poland's electronic media watchdog wants to raise the stake foreign companies are allowed to have in Polish radio and television stations to 49 percent from the current 33 percent, an official said on Friday.

"We have proposed changes to the radio and television law... to allow foreign companies hold a higher stake in the stations," Henryk Andracki, a member of the National Radio and Television Council (KRRiT), told Reuters.

The decision will be subject to approval by parliament, which is likely to debate the issue in the first half of 1997, he added.

The current three-year-old law was designed to protect Poland's media market from the domination of foreign capital.

"Our broadcasters are now well established so it is time for a change," Andracki said, adding the new regulation would help strengthen the capital of broadcasters.

Analysts say such a strengthening is needed to help televisions compete with the increasing number of pay channels on cable television, which are beamed from satellites and do not need KRRiT's costly operating licences.

Apart from two public channels, Poland now one nationwide private televison station and several regional ones.

Since the fall of communism in 1989, which ended the state media monopoly, more than hunderd private local stations and two nationwide ones have been created and they are now successfully competing with four public channels.
