<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is to negotiate a new memorandum for restoring credits to Romania with the new centrist governing coalition, President Emil Constantinescu's office said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A statement from the newly-elected president's office said a team of experts would arrive in Bucharest this weekend and evaluate the state of the economy within a week. IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus would visit Romania later this month.</p>
<p>Incoming ministers accuse the former administration of ex-Communist President Ion Iliescu of issuing misleading figures to conceal the extent of the economic crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;The financial legacy left by the previous government is very serious and this is how international lenders view it as well,&quot; Constantinescu was quoted as telling reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to know clearly the dimensions of this financial policy, which caused a huge budget deficit. We had a system of government rule by decree. This must never happen again.&quot;</p>
<p>The statement followed talks between Constantinescu and IMF chief negotiator for Romania, Poul Thomsen, aimed at restoring credits suspended this year over policy differences.</p>
<p>Thomsen told state television a new programme was needed because the economy had deteriorated badly in the past year and current criteria were no longer applicable.</p>
<p>Central Bank chief Mugur Isarescu, who was also at the talks, said formal negotiations to replace the current credit arrangement with a new programme would start in the new year.</p>
<p>Isarescu, who visited IMF headquarters in Washington last week, told the official Rompres news agency that Romania needed $1.5 billion in credits next year. He was &quot;more optimistic than usual&quot; and hoped the new programme would be signed by March.</p>
<p>The new government under Prime Minister-designate Victor Ciorbea, to be appointed within the next few days, hopes Constantinescu's election victory will improve Romania's international image of being slow moving on reform.</p>
<p>The IMF this year suspended a three-year standby credit programme of $460 million, the third agreed with post-communist Romania, with about two-thirds of the sum undistributed.</p>
<p>The fund said the outgoing administration failed to observe agreements by allowing deviations in the foreign exchange markets by trying to prop the leu currency.</p>
<p>It also criticised government expenditure in an election year which pushed the budget deficit off target.</p>
<p>This year's budget deficit is expected to be 4.0 percent of gross domestic product, compared to 2.2 percent originally agreed and later readjusted to 3.0 percent. Inflation is likely to exceed 40 percent, well above agreed levels of 20 percent.</p>
