KAZAKHSTAN MAY SET CRAWLING PEG FOR TENGE.

ALMATY 1996-12-05

Kazakhstan may control its tenge currency with a crawling peg to a foreign currency or basket of currencies, the head of the central bank said on Thursday.

National Bank Chairman Uraz Dzhandosov told the Mazhilis lower chamber of parliament that the central bank and government were now discussing such an arrangement, which he likened to the system now prevailing in Russia.

"This is similar to what in Russia is called the sloping corridor, Dzhandosov said. "We have not yet taken a final decision," he added.

The main advantage of a system such as the corridor would be to provide exporters with certainty about the future course of the exchange rate, he said.

The interests of exporters must be taken into account because the economic recovery will be export-led, not driven by domestic demand, he said.

A crawling peg allows a currency to depreciate at a slow pre-set and pre-announced rate. In Russia's version of this, the central bank announces a series of upper and lower limits within which the currency is allowed to fluctuate.

Dzhandosov said the average exchange rate of the tenge was running this year at 69-70 per dollar, stronger than the originally forecast 70-71.

The tenge, introduced in 1993, has depreciated gently since then except for a sharp appreciation in summer 1995 caused by capital inflows.

The rate of depreciation has accelerated since mid-November, and the tenge was quoted at around 73.40 per dollar on Thursday.

The central bank currently targets money supply, and exchange rate movements are geared to meeting this goal.

But it is considering moving to an exchange-rate target because of the prospect of renewed capital inflows generated by investment into the oil sector.  -- Almaty Newsroom, +7 3272 509410
