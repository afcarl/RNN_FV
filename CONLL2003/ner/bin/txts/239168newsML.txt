HUNGARY FORINT UP VS DLR, EASES VS CEN.BANK BASKET.

BUDAPEST 1996-12-06

Foreign currency buyings weakened Hungary's forint against the central bank's currency basket on Friday, but the forint opened harder against the dollar on the mark's overnight gains, dealers said.

The forint opened at 159.00/20 to one dollar and eased to 159.56/60 in early trading, but remained still above Thursday's closing of 160.47/52.

"The forint opened up as the dollar/mark went down," said Zoltan Szaloky of Altalanos Ertekforgalmi Bank.  

The forint opened some 50 fillers below the National Bank of Hungary's (NBH) resistance level (bid), unchanged from Thursday, but the gap opened to 80 fillers in an hour.

Dealers said few banks were on the market as usual at the end of the year, and foreign currency buyings triggered by foreign trade deals, position closings of foreigners and bourse palyers pushed the forint down more on this tighter market.

The forint floats within the NBH's 4.5 percent wide intervention range, against a currency basket made up 30 percent of the dollar and 70 percent of the Ecu.  

"I can imagine that the forint drifts even further (from the NBH bid)," Szaloky said.
