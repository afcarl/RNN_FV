Each draft law has to go through three readings: In the first reading, the chamber decides on either absolute refusal or further discussion of the draft.

If approved, there is the second reading in which the chamber considers ammendments proposed by deputies, and votes on whether the draft law should be sent on to a third reading.

In the third reading only minor changes can be adopted in the draft law and then the chamber decides on final passage or rejection.

The third reding must not come on the agenda sooner than 24 houres after the second reading.
