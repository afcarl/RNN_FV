DUTCH VAN LANSCHOT TO LAUNCH AEX INDEX CLICK FUND.

DEN BOSCH, Netherlands 1996-12-06

Dutch bank F. van Lanschot Bankiers said on Friday it was launching a new index fund for investing in a basket of Dutch AEX stocks.

The Index Click Fund will use as its base the AEX closing value on January 27, 1997. It will buy a protective put option at that level and will introduce additional "clicks" when the index rises 30, 50 and 70 percent above that level.

The put-options will initially be financed through a loan which will be repaid with received dividends, Van Lanschot said.

With one-off capital tax of one percent and issue costs of 1.5 percent, the maximum risk would be limited to three percent over a five-year period, Van Lanschot said.

The fund will be quoted in Amsterdam. Subscriptions open on December 9.
