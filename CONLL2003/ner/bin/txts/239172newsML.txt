DUTCH CLOSING DEBT MARKET REPORT.

AMSTERDAM 1996-12-06

Dutch bonds suffered one of the largest falls this year, plunging along with the world's major financial markets in the wake of comments by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.

The yield on the key 10-year government bond closed at 5.81 percent, the highest level in a month, compared with 5.72 pct the previous day, after Greenspan warned of "irrational exuberance" in asset markets.

Prices were dragged even lower in the morning when Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen said he saw no need for monetary policy to prop up German economic growth.  

"It's been a very bumpy ride today," said one trader.

He said some people extended their strategy of shortening duration, a feature of this week's trading, by switching from 2002-2004 paper into even shorter dates.

"It's more defensive. The market is very nervous," he added.

A broker said some players who had shortened the duration of their portfolios this week unwound their positions, adding that she also saw outright buying and selling.

The previous heavy flow of offers dried up as March Bund futures found support around the 99.60 level.

"It's been a bit of a roller-coaster," she said.

The broker said that with the immediate outlook in doubt, investors were squaring up ahead of the weekend.

The market moved off its day's lows after the release of weaker than expected November U.S. payrolls data.

"It did a bit of market underpinning," said another trader.

He also noted a move into 1999 paper from 2000s.

A technical analyst said the move up through a 5.80 percent yield level triggered a sell signal and put 10-year yields on a path toward 6.10 percent over the next six to 12 weeks.

"It doesn't look too good any more," he said, adding he was bullish in the longer term.
