<p>Dutch bonds suffered one of the largest falls this year, plunging along with the world's major financial markets in the wake of comments by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.</p>
<p>The yield on the key 10-year government bond closed at 5.81 percent, the highest level in a month, compared with 5.72 pct the previous day, after Greenspan warned of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in asset markets.</p>
<p>Prices were dragged even lower in the morning when Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen said he saw no need for monetary policy to prop up German economic growth.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's been a very bumpy ride today,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>He said some people extended their strategy of shortening duration, a feature of this week's trading, by switching from 2002-2004 paper into even shorter dates.</p>
<p>&quot;It's more defensive. The market is very nervous,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>A broker said some players who had shortened the duration of their portfolios this week unwound their positions, adding that she also saw outright buying and selling.</p>
<p>The previous heavy flow of offers dried up as March Bund futures found support around the 99.60 level.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a bit of a roller-coaster,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The broker said that with the immediate outlook in doubt, investors were squaring up ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p>The market moved off its day's lows after the release of weaker than expected November U.S. payrolls data.</p>
<p>&quot;It did a bit of market underpinning,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>He also noted a move into 1999 paper from 2000s.</p>
<p>A technical analyst said the move up through a 5.80 percent yield level triggered a sell signal and put 10-year yields on a path toward 6.10 percent over the next six to 12 weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't look too good any more,&quot; he said, adding he was bullish in the longer term.</p>
