Oil prices trim losses even as Iraqi exports near.

LONDON 1996-12-06

World crude oil prices closed steady to slightly lower on Friday, recovering from a sharp selloff after Iraq said it would be able to start crude oil exports early next week pending a final U.N. report allowing partial oil sales.

Crude also recovered from news that striking Elf refinery workers voted on Friday to end their nine-day strike in France that had cut total refinery capacity of 440,000 barrels per day and forced Elf to buy supplies in the physical market.

"The oil sales do not seem to be a big deal at the moment because first of all, we've seen these comments before, and more importantly the market can absorb the barrels for a couple of months," said Leslie Nicholas, energy analyst at GNI Ltd in London.

International marker crude Brent Blend for January delivery on London's International Petroleum Exchange fell to a new low of $23.92 a barrel as the market saw supportive factors erode.

But prices recovered later and the January contract ended down only nine cents at $24.54, and near its contract high of $24.65. Brent crude for delivery after January posted small gains.

The market initially fell on profit-taking and  prices came off again after remarks by Iraqi Oil Minister General Amir Muhammad Rasheed that Iraqi crude oil exports would resume from Tuesday.

U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said later he could not confirm the start date for the accord until he received a report from U.N. inspectors now in Iraq.

The Elf strike had supported refined products by exacerbating an already tight market for gas oil, which is used for heating oil in Europe.

Gas oil for December delivery, as a result, closed earlier $5.50 lower at $224 a tonne.

"It was overbought and the end of the French strike gave another reason for people to sell," said Jeff Potter, managing director of Univest Ireland in Dublin.

"We're still in an uptrend," he said.

A senior oil trader said oil prices had gained nearly $2.00 a barrel this week and funds were taking profits as well. He said the weakness of European stock markets was also having an impact on the oil market.

"Stock markets are under pressure and hot money is coming into oil," the trader said, adding that the market was likely to recover from the bout of profit-taking given tight supplies.

Iraqi oil exports have been banned under a U.N. economic embargo imposed by the U.N. Security Council after Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Before Friday's fall, prices had gained $1.80 a barrel, largely because of the French refinery strikes, cold weather and a U.S. refinery fire earlier in the week.

Oil prices have been consolidating at higher levels despite the prospect of imminent Iraqi oil sales because of strong demand in a tight winter market vulnerable to any potential supply disruption.

Iraq's absence from the world's market and the delay in implementing the oil-for-food plan in September took prices to their highest level since the Gulf crisis.

Under the U.N. plan, agreed on May 20, Iraq will be allowed to sell $2.0 billion in crude oil to buy food and medicines for six months. The deal is renewable.

Although importing humanitarian goods was not banned under the sanctions, an Iraq starved of oil revenue was unable to fund the purchases.

Iraq was the second biggest oil producer within the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) before the Gulf War. It produced just over 3.0 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and had an OPEC quota allocation of 3.14 million bpd.

OPEC last week decided to stick to its overall  production ceiling of 25.03 million bpd -- set in June to take account of an estimated 800,000 bpd of Iraqi exports -- for the first half of 1997. But recent high prices mean the volume will be slightly lower.

Rasheed said earlier this week that Iraq expected to export 650,000 bpd of crude oil through its two export terminals of Ceyhan on the Turkish Mediterranean coast and the Gulf port of Mina al-Bakr.

Analysts say the market should be able to absorb the Iraqi crude oil during the tight winter months without much negative impact on prices, although prices may weaken during the low demand second and third quarters.

"The way the market is at present, it can take the Iraqi barrels and send them right out again," the trader said.
