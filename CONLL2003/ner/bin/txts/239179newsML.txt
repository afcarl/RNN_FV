European vacuum gas oil was quiet on Friday as the market tracked tumbling crude and lost some of the gains seen earlier in the week.

Dealers said there was little European demand for low sulphur material. Combined with weaker VGO prices in the U.S. caused by poor buying interest it undermined prices and limited activity.

"There are a couple more cargoes on offer, but no one is taking anything," said one trader. Russian supplies were also overhanging the market.

A low sulphur cargo was heard offered in the high $160s fob, but traders thought the prices overly ambitious.

"If anything gets done, it will be down in the low $160s," said one. "Those deals that are being done at going Argus related," said another.
