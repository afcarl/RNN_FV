FOCUS - Greenspan comments revive inflation fears.

Comments from Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan sent a shockwave through European and world markets on Friday, reviving fears about the outlook for interest rates and inflation in 1997.

After a year of sharp gains for many European equity markets, investment strategist said Greenspan's comments were a reminder that U.S. rates can go up as well as down -- and of the significance of Fed rate policy for European bourses.

Yet they also pointed out that company earnings growth in many European markets looked more promising than in the United State -- potentially making stocks on this side of the Atlantic a better bet for the coming year.

Speaking at a dinner meeting of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, Greenspan said the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets because they could end up damaging the economy.

He said evaluating shifts in asset prices must be an integral part of the development of monetary policy.

"Greenspan sent a clear message to the markets -- Gentlemen, you are overdoing it, restrain yourselves,' said one dealer in Paris. "He is puncturing the speculative bubble that fuelled New York and other markets."

And with the Dow up some 25 percent this year, traders were braced for sharp falls on the blue chip U.S. index.

Greenspan's comments came ahead of key U.S. employment figures for November -- a report which is one of most closely-watched monthly U.S. economic indicators.

But this time the employment report turned out to be relatively benign in terms of market expectations, and European markets rallied to end well above their lows of the day.

Traders and analysts warned that Greenspan's remarks would reverberate around world markets for some time to come, particularly with the next monetary policy meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) due on December 17.

"The markets will be volatile at least until the FOMC meeting," said Andy Hartwill, stock market strategist at SocGen.

Yet looking further out, prospects for European equities through 1997 are influenced by factors other than Fed rate policy.

Some pundits said European markets could outperform the U.S. if interest rates stay low and an expected recovery in company profits comes through.

"The point to make about Europe is that the earnings profile of companies is entirely different," said Bill O'Neill, international investment strategist at brokerage HSBC James Capel, "and we are likely to have a highly accomodative monetary stance which will be benign for equities."

In 1997 Capel expects earnings growth of just five percent in the United States compared with around 15 percent in "core" Europe and about nine percent in Britain.

"Compared with 1994 when we saw substantial earnings upgrades in the U.S., on this occasion we are not expecting much in earnings per share growth," O'Neill said.

Anyway, O'Neill pointed out that Greenspan may still not have an imminent interest rate increase up his sleeve. "I think what Greenspan was doing was warning the markets and relieving himself of the obligation" of raising rates to burst a speculative market bubble, O'Neill said.

"We live in an uncertain world," O'Neill said, "and I think he was just concerned about the market's momentum being only one way, and of the danger of a speculative bubble building up."

"But I don't see it has having important consequences on interest rate policy."

Yet European markets could still go down next year even as they outperform Wall Street.

Greenspan's comments came as investment strategists at some major brokerages have recently been advising investors to take a cautious stance as 1996 comes to an end, suggesting an increase in their cash holdings at the expense of shares.

In a research note headed "Time for a Correction", Morgan Stanley said it was going underweight on European equities for the first time since 1995, advising a reduction of two percent from equity holdings into cash.

"Anticipating the end of a bull market is like anticipating the death of an ageing family member -- nobody wants it to happen but at a certain point the signs seem to point to the inevitability of the situation," wrote strategists Richard Davidson and Markus Rosgen at the brokerage.

"We believe European equity markets will correct from their peaks and finish 1997 up to 10 percent lower than today," the Morgan Stanley strategists said.

Others around Europe remained unworried by the shakeout. "We had risen too fast and got overheated, and some profit-taking and consolidation can only be healthy," said Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt.

In Amsterdam, where the AEX index was down over five percent at 594.96, one analyst said: "Sure we're going to have a shakeout, but let all the panic sellers come, because I know some buyers."

"Those panic sellers around now are the same people who are going to buy back stock when the index is back around 625."
