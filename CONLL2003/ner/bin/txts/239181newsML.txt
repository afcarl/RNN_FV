UK's Major effectively loses parliamentary majority.

Prime Minister John Major on Friday effectively lost his parliamentary majority when a Conservative lawmaker withdrew his support from Britain's ruling party in a row over the closure of a hospital in his constituency.

Sir John Gorst's decision dealt a body blow to the deeply unpopular party, racked all week by divisions over Britain's role in the European Union.

Major's office insisted that Gorst had not ruled out backing the Conservatives in crucial parliamentary votes but the move means Major can no longer rely on a majority in the 651-seat House of Commons.

Britain last had a minority government in 1979.

"He (Gorst) is reserving the right not to cooperate but he has not resigned the whip (quit the parliamentary party). The government still has a majority," a spokesman from Major's office in Downing Street said.

Major, bedevilled by Eurosceptic mutineers since he took over from Margaret Thatcher in 1990, has seen his 21-seat majority whittled away by defections and by-election defeats since his surprise election victory in 1992.

He does not have to call an election until next May.

The opposition Labour Party, overwhelming opinion poll favourites to end 17 years in the political wilderness, said they would not precipitate a confidence vote in parliament because they were not yet confident they could win.

Gorst accused Health secretary Stephen Dorrell of breaking a promise to keep a hospital open in his London constituency.

"I am today withdrawing my cooperation from the Government and shall not treat the "whip" as either a summons to attend the House of Commons or as placing me under any obligation to vote as advised," Gorst told reporters.

Asked if he was prepared to see the government fall, Sir John told reporters: "Wait and see."

Terry Dicks, one of the Eurosceptics who have often brought Major to the brink of defeat in parliament, also reinforced his threat to quit the party and compared the prime minister to the helmsman on the ill-fated Titanic.

Labour leader Tony Blair said: "The government is disintegrating before our eyes. It lurches from one crisis to the next. It is bereft of leadership and direction."

"This shambles cannot go on any longer and the sooner we get the chance to put them out of their misery, the better."

Labour stayed in power with a minority government in 1977 and 1978 thanks to the Liberals, who gave their support in exchange for consultation on draft laws.

When the Liberals scrapped the deal, Labour lost a no-confidence vote in March 1979, triggering an election and the start of an unbroken 17-year run in power for the Conservatives.

Major's problems look set to increase next week after a by-election in the Labour stronghold of Barnsley East. If Labour wins, Major's majority will definitely have disappeared.

Gorst's move could hardly have come at a worse moment for Major, who is trying to calm Conservatives furious at his handling of European policy and calling for the sacking of finance minister Kenneth Clarke.

Major fought to play down the row, sparked by reports Chancellor of the Exchequer Clarke had faced down the prime minister by threatening to quit if there was any hardening of government policy against a European single currency.

The Eurosceptics want Major to rule out British entry into a single currency during the next parliament, a move opposed by Clarke who wants Britain to retain its "wait-and-see" policy.
