<headline>European bourses end week with heavy losses.</headline>

<p>European bourses closed with heavy losses on Friday, badly shaken by a U.S. central bank warning over &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in markets which prompted a global sell-off.</p>
<p>The dollar and bonds were also dragged down as U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan pulled the rug from under markets by suggesting that their current levels might be overdone.</p>
<p>But the battered markets managed to claw back some losses when data in mid-afternoon on higher U.S. unemployment rates suggested subdued inflationary pressures and quelled some of the panic.</p>
<p>The only gainer, briefly, from the Greenspan's remarks was gold which rallied sharply as investors rushed to get out of equities into the safe haven of gold. But it lost the gains as stocks took on a slightly healthier hue.</p>
<p>European bourses and Wall Street have been trading at record peaks in recent weeks and many investors have been growing increasingly edgy over how long the bull run can go on.</p>
<p>Frankfurt, which saw a record close on Thursday, suffered the worst losses because it closed before the U.S. jobless figures appeared with their shreds of comfort.</p>
<p>Floor trade finished over four percent down on the DAX index but deals on in after-hours computerised transactions cut some of the losses.</p>
<p>London's FTSE index plunged 4.16 percent in early trade, chalking up its steepest one-day decline since October 1992, before it regained some composure to show a loss of 2.18 percent at the close.</p>
<p>Paris fell even further, skidding by 4.51 percent as the big sell-off got underway in morning trade. It recovered by the close to register 2.26 percent in the minus column.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan sent a clear message to the markets -- &quot;Gentlemen, you are overdoing it, restrain yourselves.' He is puncturing the speculative bubble that fuelled New York and other markets,&quot; a dealer in Paris said.</p>
<p>Greenspan stopped short of commenting on the strong performance in U.S. and European markets but made clear that he needed to factor the activities of bears and bulls on Wall Street into deliberations on interest rates.</p>
<p>Alarm bells rang quickly around the world, beginning in Tokyo where stocks plunged over three percent in frantic trade and continued until Wall Street opened to show an early loss of two percent. It later recovered half of the loss.</p>
<p>On European debt markets, bonds remained weak after Greenspan but picked themselves off the floor on the weaker jobless data.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets are really spooked,&quot; said Bill Westgate, vice-president at HSBC Securities in London. &quot;It will be hard to regain the confidence of a few days ago.&quot;</p>
<p>German March Bund futures on LIFFE were down 61 basis points at 100.09 in early afternoon, up from 99.84 before the data. British government bonds were off 31/32 at 108-25 versus 108-16 before the U.S. data.</p>
<p>On currency markets, the dollar ended European trading half a pfennig down on Thursday's close, caught in the crossfire of the sharp losses in both U.S. stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>Greenspan, who spoke of how central banks could manage to successfully puncture asset market bubbles, raised concerns about an imminent U.S. interest rate rise and sent the bond market into a tailspin.</p>
<p>But the U.S. jobless data, which helped calm the markets, allowed the dollar to recover half of its overnight losses. In late trade, it was at 1.5440 marks.</p>
<p>On bullion markets, however, gold weakened after its early rally. It finished at $369.65 an ounce after a morning fix of $373 an ounce and Thursday's London close of $370.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1700 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 112.85 yen and 1.5440 marks against 112.31 yen and 1.5490 marks in late Europe on Thursday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS CLOSING PRICES</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended 88.2 points lower at 3,963.0.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index finished down 51.78 at 2,240.72.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt closed down 117.95 at 2,791.96. The IBIS Dax index of computerised trading ended at 2832.53, down 61.90 points.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold closed at $369.65 ounce, compared with $370.00 at Thursday's close.</p>
