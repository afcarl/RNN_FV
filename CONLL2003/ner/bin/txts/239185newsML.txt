Elf strike opens 340,000 tonne product gap - trader.

LONDON 1996-12-06

A strike at three French Elf oil refineries has led to a shortfall so far of about 200,000 tonnes of gas oil, 40,000 tonnes of jet fuel and 100,000 tonnes of gasoline on the European spot market, traders said on Friday.

Elf Aquitaine declined to comment, but competitors say that every day that passes creates another 50,000 tonnes of refined product shortfall in the Elf system.

They said Elf bought the motor gasoline and jet on the international market, but turned to other French refiners for the gas oil which they drew from stocks.

"They bought a lot from local refiners, and that's the reason why we haven't seen Elf on the gas oil market," a European trading manager at a major oil company said.

He expected the refiners who sold gas oil to Elf to go on a "buying spree" for the product next week to cover the shortfall and to comply with minimum stock regulations by the end of the year.

The nine-day-old strike over pay and retirement conditions has crippled Elf's domestic network of three refineries with combined capacity of 440,000 barrels per day, a quarter of France's total.

Unions vote from 1300 GMT on Friday on proposals including a 1.5 percent pay increase.
