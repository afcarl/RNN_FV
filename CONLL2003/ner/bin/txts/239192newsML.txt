IPE Brent ends mostly higher as bulls charge on.

LONDON 1996-12-06

IPE Jan Brent crude, recovering from a 70-cent selloff, closed only slightly lower on Friday as the market shrugged off looming Iraqi oil sales and an end to the Elf refinery workers strike.

Brent futures for delivery after January ended higher.

"The oil sales do not seem to be a big deal at the moment because first of all, we've seen these comments before, and more importantly the market can absorb the barrels for a couple of months," said Leslie Nicholas, energy analyst at GNI Ltd in London.  

Traders said crude remained in a strong technical uptrend after tacking on $2 a barrel, or about nine percent, this week, and as demand was strong heading into the peak winter consumption period.

"It was overbought and the end of the French strike gave another reason for people to sell," said Jeff Potter, managing director of Univest Ireland in Dublin.

"We're still in an uptrend," he said.

Jan Brent settled nine cents lower at $24.54 after tumbling to as low as $23.92 and hitting a session high of $24.60, near its contract high of $24.65.  

Earlier, Dec gas oil settled $5.50 lower at $224 a tonne after workers at three Elf refineries voted to end their nine-day strike that had shut in about 440,000 barrels per day of total refinery capacity.

Dec gas oil still gained $3.75 from last Friday.

Oil experts charged with reviewing all oil contracts signed under the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food deal will return to New York early next week.

U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali must issue his own report to the Security Council to trigger the start of the oil deal that would allow Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months.

The aid plan would start at one minute past midnight New York time (0500 GMT) the day following Boutros-Ghali's clearance.

Senior U.N. officials said he would report on Monday, but the secretary refused to confirm the timing.
