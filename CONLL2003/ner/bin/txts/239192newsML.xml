<title>UK: IPE Brent ends mostly higher as bulls charge on.</title>
<headline>IPE Brent ends mostly higher as bulls charge on.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Jan Brent crude, recovering from a 70-cent selloff, closed only slightly lower on Friday as the market shrugged off looming Iraqi oil sales and an end to the Elf refinery workers strike.</p>
<p>Brent futures for delivery after January ended higher.</p>
<p>&quot;The oil sales do not seem to be a big deal at the moment because first of all, we've seen these comments before, and more importantly the market can absorb the barrels for a couple of months,&quot; said Leslie Nicholas, energy analyst at GNI Ltd in London.  </p>
<p>Traders said crude remained in a strong technical uptrend after tacking on $2 a barrel, or about nine percent, this week, and as demand was strong heading into the peak winter consumption period.</p>
<p>&quot;It was overbought and the end of the French strike gave another reason for people to sell,&quot; said Jeff Potter, managing director of Univest Ireland in Dublin.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still in an uptrend,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jan Brent settled nine cents lower at $24.54 after tumbling to as low as $23.92 and hitting a session high of $24.60, near its contract high of $24.65.  </p>
<p>Earlier, Dec gas oil settled $5.50 lower at $224 a tonne after workers at three Elf refineries voted to end their nine-day strike that had shut in about 440,000 barrels per day of total refinery capacity.</p>
<p>Dec gas oil still gained $3.75 from last Friday.</p>
<p>Oil experts charged with reviewing all oil contracts signed under the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food deal will return to New York early next week.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali must issue his own report to the Security Council to trigger the start of the oil deal that would allow Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months.</p>
<p>The aid plan would start at one minute past midnight New York time (0500 GMT) the day following Boutros-Ghali's clearance.</p>
<p>Senior U.N. officials said he would report on Monday, but the secretary refused to confirm the timing.</p>
