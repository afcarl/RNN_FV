LIFFE white sugar ends firmer.

LONDON 1996-12-06

London's nearby March white sugar contract gathered enough upside momentum to skirt resistance at $300 per tonne after languishing in tight ranges and thin volume for most of Friday.

March last traded up $1.40 at $299.80 after briefly touching $300.00 resistance. May was up $1.1 at $299.30. Total volume was a meagre 882 lots.

In physical news, Iran was thought to have purchased at least six cargoes of sugar for delivery in the first quarter of next year.

Traders said the cargoes were evenly split between January raws and March whites. The price paid for the raws was $268.00 per tonne, but the whites prices was yet to be determined.
