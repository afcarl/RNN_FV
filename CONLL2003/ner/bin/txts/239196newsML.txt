LME copper pares losses in late London.

LONDON 1996-12-06

London Metal Exchange (LME) three-months copper prices pared losses in late London inter-office trading.

Copper fell during Friday after another stock rise, of 6,400 tonnes, and a relaxation in spread premiums. Chart selling and sell-stops also kicked in.

Final three months business was at $2,138, down $41 from Thursday. But by the Comex close at 1900 GMT copper, which had found support and rallied late, was bid at $2,159.
