Commodities turn volatile, Greenspan helps gold.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Metals markets whipsawed on Friday as U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan propped a sagging gold bullion price and copper was hit by new volatility after news of a build in world stocks. Greenspan may have unnerved equities and bonds but, aside from gold and, to some extent, oil, his comments about "irrational exuberance" in asset markets did not make much impact on the commodity sector. Nobody as yet saw any big rush of "hot" money to a supposed safe haven in raw materials. "We've seen no major money flow into commodities so far, nor do we expect any before year end, as a result of the volatility in the stock and bond markets today," Merrill Lynch commodities strategist Bill O'Neill said.

The Goldman Sachs Commmodity Index actually was down 2.59 points at 225.17 points at the U.S. midday.

Speculators who saw a possible switch of money to gold rushed to cover short positions and that helped lift bullion just clear of three-year lows touched earlier this week amid rumours of central bank sales.

Gold ended in London after a wild day at $369.65 per ounce, although it eased in later U.S. trading. This compared with $366 touched on Tuesday but it was well below Friday's best of around $374.25. Some fresh money flowed in to the oil market, already firm on tight supply of winter heating fuel, to keep prices steady despite stronger prospects of an early easing of the U.N. Gulf War embargo against Iraq.

"Stock markets are under pressure and hot money is coming in to oil," a senior European trader said. The world marker crude, North Sea Brent Blend for January delivery on London's International Petroleum Exchange, traded late around $24.20 per barrel.

Copper prices managed a rally during afternoon London Metal Exchange (LME) trading, based on some short-covering, but the market still closed easier after a savaging earlier in the day.

Copper was around $2,160 in late London, down $15 per tonne.

Traders said copper's losses, which depressed nearly all base metals, followed another rise in LME-supervised warehouse stocks. Chart selling and sell-stops also kicked in.

Greenspan's remarks and subsequent wild trading in equity and bond markets were not a big factor, traders said.

Instead, a 6,400-tonne rise in copper stocks, the third successive increase, put the market under pressure.
