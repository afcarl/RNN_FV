NWE oil products finish lower, bar steady naphtha.

LONDON 1996-12-06

NWE oil products except naphtha were weaker on Friday, knocked by falling crude, traders said.

Gasoline ended slightly lower after striking Elf refinery workers voted to end their nine-day strike.

Naphtha ended unchanged, whipsawed by crude which rallied sharply late Thursday and then fell on Friday.

Gas oil fell $5.50 a tonne. Cargo premiums were steady but IPE contract expiry sales took $1 off barges.

Fuel oil lost up to $4 on high sulphur and $2 on low sulphur on weaker crude and the prospect of American barrels.
