NWE straight-run fuel-low sulphur falls with crude.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Straight-run fuel oil took something of a back seat on Friday as the market focussed on the end of the French Elf refinery strike and the spectre of extra American cracked barrels.

Dealers said low sulphur straight-run was down in line with crude's losses, but that the weaker numbers failed to entice buyers.

The slow but steady buying of Russian straight-run has thinned supplies and prices eased narrowly. Traders said there was no fresh news of any export tariff.
