<p>British Airways Plc, which was told it would have to meet certain conditions including giving up airport slots if its alliance with AMR Corp unit American Airlines is to be cleared, has said such a  move on slots would be unprecedented.</p>
<p>In a statement released late on Friday, BA chief executive Bob Ayling said he had informed the competition watchdog, the Office of Fair Trading about this. &quot;As has been made clear to the director general (of the OFT), the permanent unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and, if done, it must be on the basis of fair market value.&quot;  </p>
<p>BA said it was prepared to take &quot;reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition.</p>
<p>Ayling added that the proposed alliance on transatlantic routes was &quot;a competitive response to other alliances between European and US carriers...None of these alliances was investigated by the national competition authorities of the European countries concerned,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the alliance had also been negotiated on the basis of an open skies agreement on transatlantic flight access being clinched.</p>
<p>The UK airline giant said it would will respond to the government in due course. &quot;Any undertakings will be conditional on their being accepted by other relevant competition authorities,&quot; it said.</p>
