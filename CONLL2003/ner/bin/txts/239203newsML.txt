NWE naphtha ends steady, whipsawed by crude.

LONDON 1996-12-06

NWE naphtha prices ended steady on Friday after being whipsawed in the last 24 hours by crude oil, which first catapulted higher and then knocked off about half those gains.

The market was still balancing lacklustre end-user demand, strangled by higher crude prices, and some traders' expectations for higher values based on arbitrage interest to the U.S.

Dec swaps ended unchanged at $232/$233 while Jan gained about $1.50 to $228.50/$229.50. Feb swaps rose $2.25 to $220.25/$221.25, reflecting crude's sharp rally late Thursday.

Cargoes were notionally set at $232/$234 cif.
