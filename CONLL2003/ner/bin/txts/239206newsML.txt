NWE gasoline ends lower as Elf workers end strike.

LONDON 1996-12-06

NWE gasoline prices ended lower on Friday after striking Elf refinery workers voted to end their nine-day strike and buyers pulled back after a week of strong gains, traders said.

"It certainly will have some influence," said one trader, of the end to the French strike.

But traders said NWE supplies were tight after cargoes were sold to the U.S. this week and Elf was believed to have bought at least 100,000 tonnes of gasoline to meet production cuts at its three refineries.

Eurograde barges ended down $2 at $223/$225 fob ARA while regular unleaded held near unchanged at $219/$221, further narrowing that spread, possibly on talk refiners were boosting output to capitalize on rich margins.

Workers at Elf's Feyzin refinery followed two other plants back to work but only after pressing demands for strike pay and compensation.

The decision to return to work in coming days came despite an overwhelming vote to stay on strike and reject an Elf pay offer. A union official said the return to work was inevitable after workers at two other plants called off the strike.

Roughly 100,000 barrels per day of gasoline production was believed to have been lost by the strike, forcing Elf into the spot market at the same time an open arbitrage to the U.S. was sucking material out of NWE.

Cargoes were notionally valued down $3 at $225/$227 cif.
