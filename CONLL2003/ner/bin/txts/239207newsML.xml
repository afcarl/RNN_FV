<title>UK: NWE gas oil slows on screen plunge, barges down.</title>
<headline>NWE gas oil slows on screen plunge, barges down.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Tumbling futures prices triggered by the end of a French oil workers' strike drove nervous gas oil cargo traders to the sidelines on Friday but barges changed hands busily ahead of the IPE contract expury.</p>
<p>Heating oil cargo premiums were steady but volume was light with traders opting for caution in light of deep screen falls caused by the end of the Elf refinery strike. Lack of handy-sized vessel availability also restricted trade.</p>
<p>&quot;There was reluctance to commit because of the erratic screen,&quot; a trader said, also citing poor German demand.</p>
<p>Dec IPE futures fell $5.50 to $224 a tonne on the strike news and U.S. support for limited Iraqi oil sales.</p>
<p>Traders unwinding positions pushed barge premiums down $1 to Dec IPE -$1 and -$1.50 fob Rotterdam. Low sulphur diesel barges were around Dec +$11 fob ARA in thin trade.</p>
<p>&quot;People are just exiting the front spread (on barges). They've decided they really don't want to take the oil.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said the arbitrage to Asia was touch-and-go but saw the arb to U.S. opening provided large vessels were available. A French company seen seeking low sulhpur diesel into Bordeaux. Heating cargo premiums were steady at Dec IPE +$6/7.</p>
