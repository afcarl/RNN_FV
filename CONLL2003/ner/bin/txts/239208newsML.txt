Britain's Major loses parliamentary majority.

Prime Minister John Major, trying desperately to stem turmoil in his Conservative party over his policy towards Europe, suffered another serious blow on Friday when he lost his majority in parliament.

In a surprise move, Conservative MP Sir John Gorst said he was leaving the parliamentary party -- a move which wiped out the goverment's majority of one -- because of a row involving a hospital in his constituency.

"I am today withdrawing my cooperation from the government," Gorst told reporters, thereby leaving Britain with its first minority government since 1979.

Gorst, member of parliament for London's Hendon North area, told parliament Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell had broken a June promise to keep open Edgware hospital's casualty unit.

The main opposition Labour Party, far ahead in opinion polls, gleefully seized on the news but said it did not plan a vote of no-confidence in the government because it was not certain that it could win.

"The government is disintegrating before our eyes. It lurches from one crisis to the next," Labour leader Tony Blair said in a statement.

"This shambles cannot go on any longer and the sooner we get the chance to put them out of their misery, the better." In parliamentary terminology, Gorst has resigned the whip. This means that he is assumed to oppose the government, although in practice he will decide his position on individual issues and could back the government in a no-confidence vote.

Before Gorst's statement, Major had a one-seat majority in the 651-seat House of Commons lower house of parliament. Now he is considered to be in a minority of one.

Major does not have to call a snap election, since he can continue to rule with the help of minority parties in parliament, particularly pro-British Protestant parties in Northern Ireland. The election has to be called by May 22.

Labour stayed in power with a minority government in 1977 and 1978 thanks to the Liberals, who gave their support in exchange for consultation on draft laws.

When the Liberals scrapped the deal, Labour lost a no-confidence vote in March 1979, triggering an election and the start of an unbroken 17-year run in power for the Conservatives.

Major's minority looks set to increase to two next week after a by-election in the Labour stronghold of Barnsley East.

Gorst's resignation could hardly have come at a worse moment for Major, who is trying to calm Conservatives furious at his handling of European policy and calling for the sacking of finance minister Kenneth Clarke.

"Meltdown", "civil war" and "chaos" were some of the front page headlines describing Major's woes. An opinion poll showed the Conservatives were a staggering 37 points behind Labour with an election due within the next five months.

Major fought to play down the row, sparked by reports Chancellor of the Exchequer Clarke had faced down the prime minister by threatening to quit if there was any hardening of government policy against a European single currency.

But rank and file Conservative MPs, led by those on the "Eurosceptic" wing of the party opposed to any moves towards European integration, are furious at Clarke's bid to hold the line on Europe and what they see as Major's failure to resist.

The Eurosceptics want Major to rule out British entry into a single currency during the next parliament, a move opposed by Clarke who wants Britain to retain its "wait-and-see" policy.
