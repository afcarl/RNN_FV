IPE gas oil ends sharply lower, still up on week.

LONDON 1996-12-06

IPE gas oil futures ended sharply lower on Friday after striking Elf refinery workers in France voted to go back to work and traders took profits after a scorching rally this week.

Signs that Iraqi oil may flow next week, earlier than most expected, also hurt crude prices, even though the barrels were expected to be well absorbed heading into peak winter demand, traders said.

"It was very overbought and the end of the French strike gave another reason for people to sell," said Jeff Potter, managing director of Univest Ireland in Dublin.

He said the oil-for-food deal that would allow Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of crude over six months was well known in the market this week when crude rallied about $2 a barrel.

Dec gas oil ended $5.50 lower at $224 a tonne, versus its settlement a week ago of $220.25. The Dec/Jan spread tightened $2 to parity.

At 1819 GMT, Jan Brent was off 33 cents at $24.30 a barrel, trimming some of its losses after it fell to $23.92. Resistance is seen at its contract high of $24.65.

Potter said crude remained in an uptrend that served as support well below the market at $23.

"We're still in an uptrend we just needed a correction because it's overbought."
