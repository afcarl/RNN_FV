<title>UK: US Gulf/Japan grain trade lifts freight rates.</title>
<headline>US Gulf/Japan grain trade lifts freight rates.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>An overnight jump of $1.50 in the US Gulf/Japan grain rate for December loading and a strong performance from Panamaxes in the Far East were the principal features of a lively dry cargo freight market.</p>
<p>The shortage of early tonnage is apparent in nearly all areas and rates continue to rise fairly steadily, perhaps especially in the Atlantic grain trades. Following an active week the Caper market was relatively quiet and chartering for coal and ironore business was limited. The BFI increased 8 points to 1453, up 30 points for the week, but most brokers believe the index routes are conservatively marked and will show further gains next week.</p>
<p>Owners are naturally anxious that current market conditions survive the interruption of the end of the month holidays. The number of Panamax period charters reported this week and continued enquiry for tonnage for this type of business by charterers such as Shinwa and K Line certainly gives encouragement of fair prospects in this category.</p>
<p>GRAIN</p>
<p>Mitsubishi conceded a hefty $26.10 combo to Halla tonnage (probably Galene) for 52,OOO long tons soybeans US Gulf/Japan for Dec 17/25. Yesterday Hanjin were reported to have paid $24.15 no combo for the Continental-relet Scenery Sea for 54,000 heavy grain for similar dates. Trade in the other key grain route, US Gulf/Continent, was seen with Toepfer's fixture of the 1981-built Obo Atlantic Prestige of 2,990,000 cft Mississippi/Lisbon for Dec 20/30 at a lumpsum of $765,000.</p>
<p>This equates to $12.55 basis heavy grain and compares with $13.10 agreed yesterday for heavy grain by Cargill for Patmos to Hamburg. Allowing for the different port charges, steaming distances and the alleged advantage of Lisbon redelivery for an Obo, there may not be much to choose between these fixtures.</p>
<p>Cargill continue to quote business in this trade - 1.5 up to 3m cft grain for Dec 15/25. Shinwa introduced a fresh order of 52/54,000 heavy grain US Gulf/Japan for Jan 5/18. Europa 110,000 dwt open prompt Passero was rumoured fixed in grain, possibly by Dreyfus to Egypt and/or Turkey, and Geepee were believed to have booked a Panamax grain cargo US Gulf/China,but details were lacking.</p>
<p>E coast S America continued firm for Panamaxes and Handies, but details of fixtures by Pacnav of Vernal Spirit 54,000 dwt for short period in this area and by Pioneer of Panamax tonnage could not be verified. Elsewhere Andre covered 15,000 wheat Rouen/Angola for mid Dec and Toepfer Asia and Matco were involved in agriprods fixtures from S E Asia to the Continent.</p>
<p>MINERALS</p>
<p>Some firm levels for rounds and period timecharter were reported in the Far East. Pima 63,261 dwt, having failed with Nittetsu for an Australian round,as booked by Navix delivery Taiwan Dec 10/15 for a trip via Port Elizabeth to Japan at a strong $11,100 daily. Nittetsu fixed ludolf oldendorff 64,442 dwt for their Australian round at between $11,000 and 11,500 daily. Owners were particularly encouraged by NYK's fixture of Bunga Saga Tiga 72,338 dwt delivery Japan Dec 20/25 for 3-5 months, suggesting prevailing conditions may persist into the new year. In the Atlantic the Katrina-relet Anangel Enosis 73,500 dwt was rumoured fixed delivery utrip via Tampa with fertilizers to China at close to d14,000 daily. But caper news was less positive - Brazil Star 201,227 dwt for Roberts Bank/Le Havre coal with Kleimar, hrdra 168,937 dwt for w Australian ore to China with noble, and Iron Master for 110,000 coal Richards Bay/Wilhelmshaven for Preag were all said to have failed on subjects. Ostrako 125,000 dwt was rumoured fixed by Cobelfret Narvik/Misurata and Castillo de Belmonte 153,000 dwt open Fos end Dec for unknown business. In the Handy-sizes J Lauritzen booked Olevsk 39,000 dwt delivery Gibraltar for a trip via Brazil with ore to the Continent and Toepfer Asia fixed 20,000/10 fertilizers Pasadena/Ho Chi Minh, both at undisclosed rates.</p>
