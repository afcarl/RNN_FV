<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - British shares suffered their biggest one-day loss in four years as world markets tumbled following surprise anti-inflation comments from U.S. Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, yet shares had rallied from their earlier sharp decline by the close, as Wall Street steadied and a benign U.S. jobs report eased the market's interest rate fears. The FTSE 100 index closed 88.2 points lower at 3,963.0, falling 95.0 from last Friday.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The German DAX ended the bourse session down 4.05 percent with dollar down and following comments by Bundesbanker Jochimsen and U.S. Fed chief Alan Greenspan. The 30-share DAX index was down 117.96 points to 2,791.9, a drop of 53.56 on the week. In post-bourse trade the DAX index stood at 2,832.53.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares closed a dramatic trading day 2.26 percent down in a huge volume of 11.2 billion francs after a mass sell-off on remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. The sell-off brought the French market down from near historic highs and many fund managers took profits in order to hold on to the gains made so far. The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 51.78 points or 2.26 percent to 2,240.72, falling 74.94 from Friday week.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares closed two percent lower in nervous trade but well above the day's lows on the blue-chip Swiss Market (SMI) index. An early slump on Wall Street weighed on the shares but did not endanger the slight recovery in the afternoon, dealers said. The dealers were split on whether the current level would be considered a buy opportunity.</p>
<p>&quot;This depends on Wall Street&quot;, one trader noted.</p>
<p>Bourses around the world were pressured on Friday after U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's remarks about &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; on financial markets. The all-share Swiss Performance Index fell 47.37 points to 2,450.67.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo's key Nikkei index ended down more than three percent, the biggest one-day drop this year, participants were stunned by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments on the stock markets, which fueled worries over the recent euphoria on Wall Street and invited sales. The Nikkei 225 average shed 667.20 points or 3.19 percent to close at 20,276.70, down 743.66 from last week.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong's Hang Seng index posted its biggest point drop since March, as a resurgence in interest rate concerns sent the blue chip index tumbling more than 600 points at one stage during the day. The Hang Seng index closed down 388.83 points or 2.88 percent to 13,102.73, falling 291.20 from seven days ago.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Australian shares plunged after comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan spooked traders across Asian markets. By the close the All Ordinaries index was down 69.4 points or 2.9 percent to 2,313.9, dropping 74.7 from Friday week.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African shares buckled as worries of sharp losses on Wall Street gripped the market but stocks were able to claw back from their weakest levels shortly before the close on U.S. jobs data,  jitters, sparked by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve head Alan Greenspan which were interpreted by markets to mean the Dow was overheated. The Industrial index closed down 181.5 points at 7,795.2, down 202.3 on the week, the Overall index was down 116.4 points to 6,601.2, a drop of 112.7 from seven days ago and the Gold index finished 17.5 points firmer at 1,528.0, up 4.3 from last Friday.</p>
