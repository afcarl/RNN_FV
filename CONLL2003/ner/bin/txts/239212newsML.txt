LIFFE coffee fluctuates but still ends down.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Robusta coffee futures see-sawed throughout the day on early selling activity and late pre-weekend short covering but most prices still ended lower.

Traders said a brief bounce from early lows was short-lived and the market now looked set to consolidate at current levels if fund selling re-emerged.

"Now we are in no man's land again, consolidating maybe, but if the funds which have been absent from the market today decided to come back, we come down again," said one trader.

Anti-inflation remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan which had rattled the U.S. dollar and stock markets had no immediate impact on the coffee market.

By the close, front-month January was unchanged at $1,311 a tonne after testing a low of $1,303 and just above a key $1,300 support.

Most-active March, which accounted for half the day's turnover of 12,234 lots, was $11 lower at $1,238.

Traders said the March volume reflected heavy trades in Jan/March and March/May switches.

Some traders said the early selling interest was triggered by news Colombia would cut its internal coffee price by 14,000 pesos per 125-kg load to 221,500 pesos.

A forecast by a Brazilian agronomist of a fall in the 1997/98 Brazilian coffee crop from 1996/97 had no immediate market impact.

"Some are saying below 20 million bags, some are saying above 30 million and you won't get an accurate one until January. I think most sensibly it would be 25-28 million," one trader said.
