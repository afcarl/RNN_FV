<p>Robusta coffee futures see-sawed throughout the day on early selling activity and late pre-weekend short covering but most prices still ended lower.</p>
<p>Traders said a brief bounce from early lows was short-lived and the market now looked set to consolidate at current levels if fund selling re-emerged.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we are in no man's land again, consolidating maybe, but if the funds which have been absent from the market today decided to come back, we come down again,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Anti-inflation remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan which had rattled the U.S. dollar and stock markets had no immediate impact on the coffee market.</p>
<p>By the close, front-month January was unchanged at $1,311 a tonne after testing a low of $1,303 and just above a key $1,300 support.</p>
<p>Most-active March, which accounted for half the day's turnover of 12,234 lots, was $11 lower at $1,238.</p>
<p>Traders said the March volume reflected heavy trades in Jan/March and March/May switches.</p>
<p>Some traders said the early selling interest was triggered by news Colombia would cut its internal coffee price by 14,000 pesos per 125-kg load to 221,500 pesos.</p>
<p>A forecast by a Brazilian agronomist of a fall in the 1997/98 Brazilian coffee crop from 1996/97 had no immediate market impact.</p>
<p>&quot;Some are saying below 20 million bags, some are saying above 30 million and you won't get an accurate one until January. I think most sensibly it would be 25-28 million,&quot; one trader said.</p>
