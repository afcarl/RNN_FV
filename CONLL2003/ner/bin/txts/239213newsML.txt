LIFFE March cocoa ends below 950 after trade sales.

LONDON 1996-12-06

London cocoa futures lost their shine on Friday as trade-related liquidation shaved recent gains and sent March cocoa below the key 950 stg mark.

Traders, however, were not discouraged by the late bout of selling that reversed the market's bullish tone after hefty gains recorded on the heels of tumbling sterling on Thursday.

They cited good support below the market.

"It's not a bad close. It's still a weekly reversal," said one trader, referring to the second-month technical chart.

After absorbing an early dose of origin selling March cocoa managed to spent most of the session at the sensitive 950 level. It then backed off to end six stg lower at 946.

March traded from 956 to 941 in the afternoon while other contracts struck losses of up to nine on the day.

Volume was a mediocre 4,801 lots including switches, crosses and AAs, mainly centred around the benchmark March contract.

While technical hopes were not all lost below 950, with traders citing the possibility of fresh speculative covering if March spiked above 960, key industry buyers continued to show a marked reluctance to dabble in futures.

Players will watch sterling's gyrations next week but eyes will be mainly on new arrival figures out of Ivory Coast.

Traders were puzzled by the wide range of two forecasts for the 1996/97 cocoa deficit this week at 127,000 and 20,000 tonnes.

Options volume picked up sharply on Friday as a major trade house took a rare 12-month call spread, crossing 500 lots of May 975 and 1,000 calls each against 500 lots each of distant May 1,025 and 1,050 calls.

Elsewhere, Ivorian cocoa bean exports rose to 12,969 tonnes in October from 6,081 tonnes in September. But product exports declined, according to official data.

March cocoa has resistance at 950, then a chart gap between 954 and 956. -- Clelia Oziel, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8072
