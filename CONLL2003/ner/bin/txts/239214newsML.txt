Clean tanker rates steady to up for Mideast/Japan.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Clean tanker rates for 55,000 tonne vessels making Mideast/Japan voyages held their strength on Friday amid healthy fixing, shipping brokers said.

While the 50,000 tonne Maryann was heard to have been fixed for the route at W200, brokers said the market was higher at around W205. "This rate should stay at this level," one broker said.

Mediterranean markets were strong too as a steady stream of fixtures for naphtha cargoes making transatlantic voyages supported rates for the larger vessels.

Brokers assessed numbers for 30,000 tonners making cross-Med journeys at W170, and at W150 for the larger sized ships.

Caribs/upcoast U.S. voyages were looking robust and chartering continued in a steady stream. Vessels of 30,000 tonnes were assessed at around W200.

In the U.K./Cont region, gasoline continues to move transatlantic with one 60,000 tonner, the Kapitan Tchakenko, having moved at W130. But the European gasoline market has been tightened to the tune of some 150,000 tonnes so far because of the Elf refinery strike, which was fizzling out on Friday. This tightness may restrict arbitrage opportunities. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 8167
