<title>UK: Crude tanker rates weak for mideast/Japan VLCCs.</title>
<headline>Crude tanker rates weak for mideast/Japan VLCCs.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Rates for 250,000 tonne very large crude carriers (VLCCs) originating in the Middle East remained weak on Friday amid a relative dearth of enquiry for tonnage but rates in the Mediterranean for 80,000 tonne Aframaxes firmed, shipping brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The (Mideast-Japan VLCC) market has come off and there may be room for a little further softening next week,&quot; one broker said. Toktank fixed three vessels in December at W62.5 and these appeared to consolidate the market's recent fall. Rates from the Middle East to other destinations were also seen softening as dealers expected limited enquiries for tonnage.</p>
<p>But 80,000 tonne Aframax rates in the Med were firmer and suitable ships were scarce, while enquiries were steady. Repsol was heard having fixed an Aframax at W107.5 and brokers thought rates could be at least a couple of points higher next week.</p>
<p>Bad weather was adding another layer of support and brokers reported delays of five days at Fiumicino and Falconara, with possible delays too at Sidi Kreir and Zuetina.</p>
<p>West African markets were soft and chartering activity was rather lacklustre. &quot;These have softened and may come off further,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>One broker reflected the market consensus that the going rate for Suezmaxes was somewhere &quot;in the low 90s.&quot;</p>
<p>Caribbean rates were looking healthy and chartering activity has been good, with rates for 70,000 tonners making upcoast U.S. voyages working out at around W150.</p>
<p>Brokers saw continued room for upwards movement in that market in the coming week. &quot;The Caribbean and possibly even the Med look fairly set for rises although, in the former area we do not expect quite such a dramatic increase as in the last seven days,&quot; one broker said.</p>
