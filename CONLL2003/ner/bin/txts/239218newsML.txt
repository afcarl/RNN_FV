Brent crude oil market steady in thin business.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Deals on both paper and wet Brent markets were scarce as players focused on volatile outright values in a news-driven market, traders said.

January Brent paper traded twice at $24.45 a barrel before Brent futures came off on news about the likely timing of Iraqi crude exports and the end of Elf's French refinery strikes.

Intermonth spreads were slightly softer in the afternoon with Jan/Feb trading at +73 cts, a cent or two below earlier talk.

CFDs were unchanged in the absence of fresh physical deals. A roll of Dec 9-13 dates into Dec 16-20 was done at 31 cents.

Physical Brent was untraded on Friday with traders saying a cargo offered late on Thursday at Jan +40 cents failed to find bidders. The seller reported withdrawing the cargo for want of higher bids.

Dated Brent was notionally valued at between a premium of 35-40 cents over January paper. All four Brent dates which turned wet on Friday were kept.

Traders said the absence of a North Sea glut coming into the slow Christmas season was likely to keep differentials steady with only a handful of December barrels still looking for homes.

A cargo of Statfjord loading Dec 24-26 fetched Dated Brent +45 cents, up two cents from the last done deal. Duc loading early January traded at a 23 cent premium to Dated Brent.

Iraq said on Friday that it would be able to export crude starting Tuesday if the U.N. Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, submitted his final report as scheduled on Monday.

But Boutros-Ghali said later that he could not confirm the start date for the Iraqi oil-for-food accord, saying he must wait for a report from inspectors before issuing clearance.

A senior London trader said the additional Iraqi crude was not likely to have much impact on a tight market.
