<title>UK: Brent crude oil market steady in thin business.</title>
<headline>Brent crude oil market steady in thin business.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Deals on both paper and wet Brent markets were scarce as players focused on volatile outright values in a news-driven market, traders said.</p>
<p>January Brent paper traded twice at $24.45 a barrel before Brent futures came off on news about the likely timing of Iraqi crude exports and the end of Elf's French refinery strikes.</p>
<p>Intermonth spreads were slightly softer in the afternoon with Jan/Feb trading at +73 cts, a cent or two below earlier talk.</p>
<p>CFDs were unchanged in the absence of fresh physical deals. A roll of Dec 9-13 dates into Dec 16-20 was done at 31 cents.</p>
<p>Physical Brent was untraded on Friday with traders saying a cargo offered late on Thursday at Jan +40 cents failed to find bidders. The seller reported withdrawing the cargo for want of higher bids.</p>
<p>Dated Brent was notionally valued at between a premium of 35-40 cents over January paper. All four Brent dates which turned wet on Friday were kept.</p>
<p>Traders said the absence of a North Sea glut coming into the slow Christmas season was likely to keep differentials steady with only a handful of December barrels still looking for homes.</p>
<p>A cargo of Statfjord loading Dec 24-26 fetched Dated Brent +45 cents, up two cents from the last done deal. Duc loading early January traded at a 23 cent premium to Dated Brent.</p>
<p>Iraq said on Friday that it would be able to export crude starting Tuesday if the U.N. Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, submitted his final report as scheduled on Monday.</p>
<p>But Boutros-Ghali said later that he could not confirm the start date for the Iraqi oil-for-food accord, saying he must wait for a report from inspectors before issuing clearance.</p>
<p>A senior London trader said the additional Iraqi crude was not likely to have much impact on a tight market.</p>
