Panagora sees emerging market resurgence in 1997.

The emerging markets sector is set to make a comeback in 1997 as global liquidity rises and investors chase better returns, Panagora Asset Management says.

"We see generally favourable global economic conditions with investors seeking higher yields after some tremendous returns in 1995 and 1996 from the US," emerging markets fund manager Kristine Lino said in a presentation.

"Despite the setback with Mexico in 1994 people understand the growth and diversification arguments for emerging markets very well."

But she warned that players would have to have a clear country asset allocation process and keep a tight lid on costs, avoiding being in the wrong markets and churning portfolios.

Panagora sees three ways to add value to an investment: a clear country allocation, picking smaller countries, which offer faster growth within the screened asset class, and using a quantitative approach to stock selection.

"There is a huge divergence between the best performing markets and the worst," Lino said. "Emerging markets are highly prone to boom and bust cycles and sentiment about them is always exaggerated. The market choice is critical to outperformance."

Countries are first screened out for undue political risk, poor liquidity, poor foreign access, a narrow spread of companies and sectors in the local market and lack of "meaningful economic and financial data".

The "universe" is determined once a year and country allocations are adjusted quarterly. In 1997, Hungary and the Czech Republic are likely to be included but Russia and China still do not meet the house risk criteria.

She then equal-weights the countries in her emerging markets "universe" rather than relying on market capitalisation.

Other countries sometimes included in emerging market indices such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia are also regarded as "too developed" by Panagora.

Once the country spread has been decided, Lino says she uses certain valuation criteria to pick stocks -- price to book ratios, price/earnings, average company size calculations and dividend yield.

"Dividend yield comes in and out of favour depending which market you are in," Lino notes. "But other factors are more important for asset allocation."

She said it was vital to avoid turnover costs, which she said could be 200 basis points higher in emerging markets than developed ones.

The funds she manages for US and Canadian pension plan sponsors and consultants tend to invest in the top five or 10 blue chip stocks in each country. "Liquidity is a real issue beyond the top stocks and you have to deal with those issues," she said.

Lino said she is currently overweight Poland, Greece, Turkey, Portugal and Brazil and underweight South Africa, Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand.

Panagora, with offices in Boston and London, manages over $15 billion for clients worldwide.
