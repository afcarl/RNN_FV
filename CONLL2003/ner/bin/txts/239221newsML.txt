IPE oil futures extend losses on Iraq, France.

LONDON 1996-12-06

IPE oil futures tumbled to new session lows ahead of gas oil's close as the strike by Elf refinery workers loosened its grip and the U.S. voiced support for the Iraqi oil-for-food deal, traders said.

Profit taking ahead of the weekend and after Brent tacked on about $2 a barrel this week also slammed the market, they said.

"I think that helped the latest tweak down," said Charles Gray, energy analyst at Prudential, of the comment by Deputy American U.N. Ambassador Edward Gnehm that the U.S. fully supported the limited oil sales deal.  

But Gnehm also said full sanctions against Iraq were not going to be lifted any time soon.

At 1711 GMT, Jan Brent was off 60 cents at $24.03 and dropping to $23.92.

Dec gas oil traded $5.50 lower at $224 after reaching $222.25. The Dec/Jan spread also narrowed $2 to trade at parity after the French strike had propped up products prices due to a cut in refinery production.  

Unions confirmed that workers at the 210,000 barrels per day Donges refinery voted to return to work, changing their minds to reject an Elf pay offer after hearing that workers at the Grandpuits refinery had voted to go back to work.

The union also said that the third Elf French plant would resume work after strike pay talks.

"It's a Friday with the market having been up $2...so we have profit-taking," Gray said.

He put longer-term support at $23.50, roughly a 50 percent retracement of its gains this week.
