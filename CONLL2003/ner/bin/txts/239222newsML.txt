Options--Cocoa in rare spread trade, coffee active.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Cocoa options volume picked up sharply on Friday after a major trade house dabbled in a rare 12-month calendar call spread in cocoa, market makers said.

"We are trying to work out exactly what they were doing but it could be a 12-month calendar call spread," said one. "This is quite rare in cocoa."

Coffee options also saw renewed interest, with volume rising in the past few sessions as futures broke away from their recent tight $1,415-$1,475 range basis January.

In cocoa, options volume jumped to 2,006 lots on Friday from a light volume in the past few days after the trade house dealt in some spread trades.

The company crossed 500 lots May 1997 975 calls and 500 lots May 1,000 calls against 500 lots May 1998 1,025 calls and 500 lots May 1,050 calls.

"Personally, I prefer to buy the near May calls and sell the forward May calls," the trader said.

Prior to Friday, the March 950 puts was traded 200 lots this week in what was seen as directional selling with buyers being mainly volatility buyers.

A recommended strategy in the short-term was to do a strangle -- selling the March 950 calls and selling March 900 puts.

Cocoa volatilities were a bit better with puts bidding at 15 percent and calls at 18.5-19 percent. Cocoa futures started a new winning streak this week as the benchmark March position pierced nearby resistance of 950 stg in a rally led by sterling's fall against the dollar and mark.

March held its position at around 950 in an otherwise dull trade on Friday, but showed a marked inability to climb any further.

The main snag is lack of industry buyers. Traders said specculative short covering could only help up to a certain extent, and large specs were not interested below 975-980 level.

In coffee options, the market saw on a butterfly trade in March $1,150, $1,250 and $1,350 puts.

Overall volume reached over 2,000 lots against 800 to 1,200 lots in the last two days.

The fresh interest in options followed increased volatility in the futures market. Until early last week, the January futures were secured in the $1,415-$1,475 band.

The front-month position has fallen to close at $1,311 in on Friday, unchanged from Thursday's finish. The January $1,400 puts continued to hold a large open position of 1,364 lots with eight trading days to go before the expiry.

"We see a bit of short-covering on the calls ahead of the expiry," one trader said.

A recommended strategy for bears was to buy the put spread in March, traders said. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985
