<title>UK: Options--Cocoa in rare spread trade, coffee active.</title>
<headline>Options--Cocoa in rare spread trade, coffee active.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Cocoa options volume picked up sharply on Friday after a major trade house dabbled in a rare 12-month calendar call spread in cocoa, market makers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying to work out exactly what they were doing but it could be a 12-month calendar call spread,&quot; said one. &quot;This is quite rare in cocoa.&quot;</p>
<p>Coffee options also saw renewed interest, with volume rising in the past few sessions as futures broke away from their recent tight $1,415-$1,475 range basis January.</p>
<p>In cocoa, options volume jumped to 2,006 lots on Friday from a light volume in the past few days after the trade house dealt in some spread trades.</p>
<p>The company crossed 500 lots May 1997 975 calls and 500 lots May 1,000 calls against 500 lots May 1998 1,025 calls and 500 lots May 1,050 calls.</p>
<p>&quot;Personally, I prefer to buy the near May calls and sell the forward May calls,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Prior to Friday, the March 950 puts was traded 200 lots this week in what was seen as directional selling with buyers being mainly volatility buyers.</p>
<p>A recommended strategy in the short-term was to do a strangle -- selling the March 950 calls and selling March 900 puts.</p>
<p>Cocoa volatilities were a bit better with puts bidding at 15 percent and calls at 18.5-19 percent. Cocoa futures started a new winning streak this week as the benchmark March position pierced nearby resistance of 950 stg in a rally led by sterling's fall against the dollar and mark.</p>
<p>March held its position at around 950 in an otherwise dull trade on Friday, but showed a marked inability to climb any further.</p>
<p>The main snag is lack of industry buyers. Traders said specculative short covering could only help up to a certain extent, and large specs were not interested below 975-980 level.</p>
<p>In coffee options, the market saw on a butterfly trade in March $1,150, $1,250 and $1,350 puts.</p>
<p>Overall volume reached over 2,000 lots against 800 to 1,200 lots in the last two days.</p>
<p>The fresh interest in options followed increased volatility in the futures market. Until early last week, the January futures were secured in the $1,415-$1,475 band.</p>
<p>The front-month position has fallen to close at $1,311 in on Friday, unchanged from Thursday's finish. The January $1,400 puts continued to hold a large open position of 1,364 lots with eight trading days to go before the expiry.</p>
<p>&quot;We see a bit of short-covering on the calls ahead of the expiry,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>A recommended strategy for bears was to buy the put spread in March, traders said. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985</p>
