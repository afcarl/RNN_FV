Coconut oil gains in late thin trade, short supply.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Coconut closed firmly despite light volume trading as supply tightness remained the driving force behind this sector of the market.

"Very little coconut oil changed hands today but when you have an ongoing supply tightness, it doesn't take much to move the market, especially on a Friday afternoon," a trader said.

At the close coconut oil was $5 to $27.50 higher.

Trade ranged from $820 on Nov/Dec, $785 on Dec/Jan and $760/$770 Jan/Feb. Nov/Dec was further offered at $827.50, a rise of $27.50 from Thursday's close.

The palm oil sector ended mostly unchanged to $2.50 up.

Crude palm oil sold for $577.50 on Dec and $550 on Jan. A switch was also made from Dec in to Jan at a $32.50 premium. One other trade during the afternoon was for stearin at $370 on Jan.

Soy remained steady at 0.50 guilders higher following early gains on the Chicago soybean oil futures but only managed a couple of trades. Dec traded at 87.50 and Aug/Oct at 92.50.

Rape oil ignored the steady soy oil and drifted lower by 0.25 guilders. No trade was reported. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 8074
