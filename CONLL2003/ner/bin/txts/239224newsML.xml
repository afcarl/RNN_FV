<title>UK: Coconut oil gains in late thin trade, short supply.</title>
<headline>Coconut oil gains in late thin trade, short supply.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Coconut closed firmly despite light volume trading as supply tightness remained the driving force behind this sector of the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Very little coconut oil changed hands today but when you have an ongoing supply tightness, it doesn't take much to move the market, especially on a Friday afternoon,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>At the close coconut oil was $5 to $27.50 higher.</p>
<p>Trade ranged from $820 on Nov/Dec, $785 on Dec/Jan and $760/$770 Jan/Feb. Nov/Dec was further offered at $827.50, a rise of $27.50 from Thursday's close.</p>
<p>The palm oil sector ended mostly unchanged to $2.50 up.</p>
<p>Crude palm oil sold for $577.50 on Dec and $550 on Jan. A switch was also made from Dec in to Jan at a $32.50 premium. One other trade during the afternoon was for stearin at $370 on Jan.</p>
<p>Soy remained steady at 0.50 guilders higher following early gains on the Chicago soybean oil futures but only managed a couple of trades. Dec traded at 87.50 and Aug/Oct at 92.50.</p>
<p>Rape oil ignored the steady soy oil and drifted lower by 0.25 guilders. No trade was reported. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 8074</p>
