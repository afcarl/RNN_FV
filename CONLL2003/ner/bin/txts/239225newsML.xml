<p>British Prime Minister John Major's office said on Friday that rebel Conservative MP Sir John Gorst had not &quot;resigned the whip&quot; (quit the parliamentary party) and the government still had a majority in the 651-seat parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Gorst) isreserving the right not to cooperate, but he has not resigned the whip. The government still has a majority,&quot; a spokesman from Major's office in Downing Street said.  </p>
<p>Gorst's office said later the MP would not feel himself obliged to vote with the government. He said at one point during a press conference: &quot;I have seen my whip (party manager) for next week which, of course, doesn't mean very much to me now.&quot;</p>
<p>Before Gorst's statement, Major had a one-seat majority in the 651-seat House of Commons lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>In his formal statement, Gorst said: &quot;I am today withdrawing my cooperation from the government and shall not treat the &quot;whip' as either a summons to attend the House of Commons or as placing me under any obligation to vote as advised.&quot; Gorst resigned over a hospital closure in his constituency.</p>
