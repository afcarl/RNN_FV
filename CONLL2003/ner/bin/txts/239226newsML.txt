Sugar freight business slows, new enquiry scarce.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Business slackened on the sugar freight market at the end of the week with little firm business reported and only a couple of new orders, shipbrokers said.

The only fixture sighted on Friday came from Tate & Lyle, which covered an earlier enquiry and fixed 14,100/14,200 tonnes of bulk sugar from Maputo to London for mid-December dates at around stg 13.75.

Amerop quoted for about 8,000 tonnes in bulk from Salaverry to US Gulf/Atlantic to 23 December/5 January and Cargill was open for 14,000 tonnes of bagged sugar from Poland to Syria with options of Egypt and Tunisia for mid-December.

Elsewhere, Iran was reported to have bought at least six cargoes of white and raw sugar for January and March arrivals.

Details of the purchases were still unclear. Origins mentioned for the whites were the European Union and Thailand, while Cuba and Brazil are likely candidates for the raws.
