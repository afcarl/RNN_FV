Upland cotton prices surge on demand in Europe.

LIVERPOOL 1996-12-06

Central Asian origins led cotton prices up on Friday as sellers turned coy and fresh demand came from German and North African spinners, industry sources said.

Uncertainty over supply quality encouraged sellers of Central Asian descriptions to hold back. Trade sources also noted increased demand from Belgium and France for this origin, currently the most sought-after in Europe.

Other upland prices were pulled higher as spinners' fears over availability spread with Australian and U.S. descriptions gaining 0.75 cents a lb. Central Asian types saw increases of up to 0.50 cents and the "A' Index ended up 0.30.

Some spinners expressed concern that if the bullish trend continues, profit margins would suffer significantly unless the consumer market supports a commensurate increase in yarn prices.
