LIFFE March white sugar touches $300, edges back.

LONDON 1996-12-06

London's nearby March white sugar contract finally gathered enough upside momentum to touch resistance at $300 per tonne after languishing in tight ranges and thin volume for most of the session, traders said on Friday.

Mixed trade and broker buying stoked the spot value after a quiet morning but arbitrage activity was limited as the expected rally in the raws failed to materialise.

The March white/raw premium traded in a range between $70.50 and $71.50 but selling was still widely anticipated. "It's on the firm side after what it has been," said one broker.

Market sources have said short funds in the raws will have to cover their positions at some stage, inducing a rally that could push the March white premium to as narrow as $60.

"It (the arbitrage) will probably be a function of London staying reasonably pressured...and maybe New York rallying as we come into the start of the year," a trader said. At 1649 GMT March was up $1.30 at $299.70 after briefly touching $300.00 resistance. May was at almost the same level, up 80 cents at $299.00, and volume was light at 805 lots.

"I get the feeling that the buying was because they thought New York was going to have a little run," the broker said.

Some crosses were also noted in May/August.

Technically, March's value is starting to form a small upward channel dating from this week's tumble to $296.70, but the positions still faces heavy resistance from a cluster of short-term moving averages extending upwards from $307.50.

Momentum indicators have turned higher and are starting to approach the neutral zero line. March's slow stochastic indicators are poised to converge in oversold territory, suggesting a reversal to the upside after recent weakness.

Paris positions were slightly firmer in a light total volume of 306 lots. March was up $1.30 at $300.00 and May up 50 cents at $299.00.

In physical news, Iran was thought to have purchased at least six cargoes of sugar for delivery in the first quarter of next year.

Traders said the cargoes were evenly split between January raws and March whites. The price paid for the raws was $268.00 per tonne, but the whites prices was yet to be determined.
