<text>
<p>London's nearby March white sugar contract finally gathered enough upside momentum to touch resistance at $300 per tonne after languishing in tight ranges and thin volume for most of the session, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>Mixed trade and broker buying stoked the spot value after a quiet morning but arbitrage activity was limited as the expected rally in the raws failed to materialise.</p>
<p>The March white/raw premium traded in a range between $70.50 and $71.50 but selling was still widely anticipated. &quot;It's on the firm side after what it has been,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>Market sources have said short funds in the raws will have to cover their positions at some stage, inducing a rally that could push the March white premium to as narrow as $60.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the arbitrage) will probably be a function of London staying reasonably pressured...and maybe New York rallying as we come into the start of the year,&quot; a trader said. At 1649 GMT March was up $1.30 at $299.70 after briefly touching $300.00 resistance. May was at almost the same level, up 80 cents at $299.00, and volume was light at 805 lots.</p>
<p>&quot;I get the feeling that the buying was because they thought New York was going to have a little run,&quot; the broker said.</p>
<p>Some crosses were also noted in May/August.</p>
<p>Technically, March's value is starting to form a small upward channel dating from this week's tumble to $296.70, but the positions still faces heavy resistance from a cluster of short-term moving averages extending upwards from $307.50.</p>
<p>Momentum indicators have turned higher and are starting to approach the neutral zero line. March's slow stochastic indicators are poised to converge in oversold territory, suggesting a reversal to the upside after recent weakness.</p>
<p>Paris positions were slightly firmer in a light total volume of 306 lots. March was up $1.30 at $300.00 and May up 50 cents at $299.00.</p>
<p>In physical news, Iran was thought to have purchased at least six cargoes of sugar for delivery in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>Traders said the cargoes were evenly split between January raws and March whites. The price paid for the raws was $268.00 per tonne, but the whites prices was yet to be determined.</p>
