<title>UK: Copper ends with pared losses, LME stung.</title>
<headline>Copper ends with pared losses, LME stung.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Copper prices managed to stage a half-hearted rally during afternoon LME trading, based on some short-covering, but the market still closed easier after a savaging earlier in the session.</p>
<p>Traders said copper's losses, which depressed nearly all base metals, followed another stock rise and a relaxation in spread premiums. Chart selling and sell-stops also kicked in.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a bit of a rally afer it bottomed out (at $2,122), but this is another poor technical close, and it looks like the next number to be hit will be $2,100,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>The overnight remarks by U.S Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan warning about irrational exeburance in asset markets, and subsequent wild trading in equity and bond markets were not an LME factor, traders said.</p>
<p>Instead, the 6,400-tonne rise in copper stocks, the third successive increase, put the market under pressure from the outset. The stock data was doubly negative, as there was no significant build in Singapore.</p>
<p>Traders said the increases in the U.S. reflected arbitrage movements, but there are now some 10,000 to 20,000 tonnes of metal believed to be off-warrant in Singapore. Some fear that this will be registered &quot;en bloc&quot;, sending prices into another tailspin.</p>
<p>Final three months business was at $2,138, still down $41 from Thursday. Cash/threes ended at $150/155, having touched $135 earlier today. Concern over late December tightness has eased, with Dec/one day at a premium of just $3.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, aluminium was the exception to the trend, with a 3,325-tonne inventory fall and reports of rising physical premiums helping to stave off the copper-related pressure.</p>
<p>Support was evident on dips towards $1,500, and prices took advantage of a late flip up to close at $1,526, a $3 gain from yesterday.</p>
<p>The nickel market traded quietly, with a 444-tonne stock rise putting some pressure on prices, although losses were not large. Last kerb trade was at $6,860, against Thursday's close of $6,880.</p>
<p>The tin market paid little heed to news that Bolivia's 25,000 tonne a year Vinto smelter was on an indefinite strike, with prices trending lower throughout the session. Last business was at $6,020, down $70.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment it (tin) is a prisoner of copper, and on a day like today it was always going to fall,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Lead managed to hold above $680, but was softer after a 1,200-tonne stock increase and in line with the general trend. Last trade was at $680, a loss of $10.</p>
<p>Zinc was unable to deriver much succour from a healthy 3,050-tonne drawdown in stocks, with prices tumbling instead on some liquidation. The market held at $1,040, but still ended $17 easier at $1,048.</p>
<p>Aluminium alloy was mostly neglected, but prices held fairly steady, with business at $1,360 little different from Thursday's close of $1,360/65.</p>
