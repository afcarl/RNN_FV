Currency moves stifle UK grain futures markets.

LONDON 1996-12-06

LIFFE wheat and barley trading was largely stifled by currency uncertainties, despite moves elsewhere triggered by the EU's tenders, traders said.

"People just didn't want to play," one futures trader said, citing swings in sterling's value against continental currencies as the factor putting off potential market players. "They squared their positions and left it alone," he said.

The net effect was falls of up to 0.50 stg in wheat, which traders called no more than a downward drift.

There had been expectations that the market might firm today on the EU's larger-than-expected tender award Thursday and the French market response to it, another trader explained. The French market jumped on the EU's release of more than 400,000 tonnes of soft wheat.

But sterling's moves overshadowed fundamental grains news.

Volume was dismal, with just 318 lots of wheat changing hands during the day.

Front month January was most active on wheat, with 109 lots done, last traded down 0.40 stg at 94.80 stg per tonne. Biggest fall in wheat was for March, down 0.50 at 96.70 stg.

Just 15 lots of barley were traded, all at an unchanged 92.00 stg for January. --Christopher Lyddon, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7928
