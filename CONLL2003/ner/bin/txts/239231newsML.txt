FORECAST - Rising costs to depress Ashanti.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Rising costs will have depressed 12 month earnings at Ashanti Goldfields, the Ghanaian mine which will report results on Tuesday, analysts said.

Costs have spiralled since the company was floated two years ago, but recent management changes should bring about greater efficiencies in the near future, industry watchers added.

Their forecasts for net earnings for the period until September 30 range between $75 and $86 million compared with $105.8 million a year ago. "The operating management at the main mine at Obuasi really wasn't doing as well as it should have been doing," said Charles Kernot at Paribas Capital Markets.  

Hedging will have limited Ashanti's exposure to falling gold prices in the six months to September 30, analysts added.

Ashanti, one of the world's biggest gold mines, is 30 percent owned by British conglomerate Lonrho, which recently saw  South African mining house Anglo American becoming its biggest shareholder with a 28 percent holding.

Anglo is said to be keen to co-operate with Ashanti, but analysts rule out a bid which probably would be blocked by the Ghanaian government. Analysts believe Anglo will remain a quiet indirect shareholder in the near future, hoping for closer ties in some form or other in the long-term.
