British stocks seen jittery next week, eyeing Wall St.

British stocks will be hoping to catch their breath in the coming week after surprise anti-inflation comments from Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan sent a tremor through world markets on Friday.

Yet in a week packed with inflation indicators on both sides of the Atlantic, markets seem likely to remain in a jittery mood, worried about the outlook for interest rates and inflation through 1997.

And in the UK, the unstable political situation could also unsettle the markets, with Prime Minister John Major obliged on Friday to declare his full support for finance minister Kenneth Clarke after reports of policy disagreements between the two.

Markets are anyway likely to remain on edge in the run-up to the key December 17 meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's key policy-making Open Markets Committee (FOMC).

"The weekend press will be filled with speculation about splits, that the Tories will dump Clarke," said Andy Hartwill, strategist at brokerage SocGen, "and the markets will be volatile at least until the December 17 FOMC meeting."

On Friday Conservative party legislator John Gorst said he was leaving the ruling parliamentary party, wiping out the government's majority of one.

Some traders said the Friday fall-out was no more than a bout of profit-taking on the strong gains seen this year in equities on both sides of the Atlantic.

Friday's lower-than-expected U.S. employment report also helped calm fears that economic growth is poised to revive, boosting hopes that inflation is unlikely to become a problem anytime soon.

Yet others pointed out that Greenspan's comments about the "irrational exuberance" of markets seemed to have been aimed specifically at capping the rip-roaring market gains seen this year.

"With my hand on my heart I could not say I would be a buyer at these levels," said trader in UK stocks. "There is no point in being a hero in these markets."

UK economic reports this week include producer prices for November on Monday and retail prices on Thursday.

In the U.S., producer prices, consumer prices and retail sales reports are also released during the week.

In a sparse week for UK company results, groups reporting include Chubb Security Plc, British Land Plc, London Electricity Plc and Greenall Plc.

The FTSE 100 index of blue chip stocks on Friday tumbled more than 150 points at one stage, before rallying towards the close as Wall Street steadied after an expected early tumble.

The FTSE's decline took the index at one stage to its lowest level since September 6. The index set a record intraday level of 4,094.4 on November 26.
