NWE jet fuel barge premiums slip, demand weak.

LONDON 1996-12-06

NWE jet fuel barge premiums sagged on continuing thin demand on Friday but trade again was limited mostly to barge selling into cargoes to satisfy Scandinavian demand, traders said.

Benchmark Dec IPE futures shed $4 to $225.25 a tonne as workers at one Elf refinery voted to end their nine-day-old strike.

Barges traded at Dec IPE +$24 fob ARA, down $2, unable to shed persistent length. Cargo premiums were notionally Dec IPE +$36 cif NWE and two vessels were seen done into France.

The Med was notionally around fob Med high +$5/8.
