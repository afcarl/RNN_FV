UK November input prices are set to slide on the back of a dip in oil prices and a strong pound, while producer output prices will edge up with a resurgent manufacturing sector, economists said on Friday.

But they said producer price data, due on Monday at 0930 GMT, will have little impact on speculation over an interest rate rise.

A Reuters forecast showed that analysts expect seasonally adjusted input prices to decline 0.8 percent on the month, dipping 2.6 percent year-on-year. Output prices are projected to rise 0.1 percent on the month and 2.2 percent year-on-year.

Underlying output prices, excluding food, drink and tobacco, are forecast to rise 0.1 percent month-on-month and 0.8 percent annually.

HSBC Markets' Jonathan Loynes said oil prices, which drove October input prices higher, have declined significantly over the month and will drag November's prices down.

"But input prices normally rise sharply in November as the cold weather generally forces up oil prices. Accordingly, seasonally adjusted prices should fall even further," he said, forecasting a 2.0 percent month-on-month decline.

The annual rate of decline would then reach 3.6 percent, the greatest since March 1991, Loynes said.

Philip Uglow, economist at Union Plc, said a 9.6 percent decline in oil prices in November would more than offset a one percent rise in general commodity prices.

"All in all, we expect to see input prices fall 0.8 percent in November, leaving them 2.4 percent below levels a year ago," Uglow said.

Morgan Stanley economist Mark Miller said sterling's steady appreciation would also help push input prices lower.

"The fall in input prices is temporary to the extent of that factor. Commodity prices are starting to pick up a little bit now," Miller said.

"Output prices are still fully benign, but the trend might be starting to bottom out. There is probably a margins story coming through soon with a recovery in manufacturing, and we might expect to see producers' output prices go up soon."

October data released on Friday showed manufacturing output rose 0.5 percent, both month-on-month and year-on-year while industrial output grew 1.3 percent year-on-year but was flat over the month.

"The other implication is a strong story for corporate profits in 1997," Miller said. "If manufacturing picks up strongly, as we expect it will, average earnings will certainly trend upwards as unit wage costs drift down."

Economists said the growth in producer output prices would take time to filter through to retail prices, and was unlikely to affect interest rates in the short term.

"The upward trend in output prices will put upward pressure on interest rates next year. The main factor will, of course, be domestic demand," Miller said.
