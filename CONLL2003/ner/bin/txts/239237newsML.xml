<p>UK November input prices are set to slide on the back of a dip in oil prices and a strong pound, while producer output prices will edge up with a resurgent manufacturing sector, economists said on Friday.</p>
<p>But they said producer price data, due on Monday at 0930 GMT, will have little impact on speculation over an interest rate rise.</p>
<p>A Reuters forecast showed that analysts expect seasonally adjusted input prices to decline 0.8 percent on the month, dipping 2.6 percent year-on-year. Output prices are projected to rise 0.1 percent on the month and 2.2 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Underlying output prices, excluding food, drink and tobacco, are forecast to rise 0.1 percent month-on-month and 0.8 percent annually.</p>
<p>HSBC Markets' Jonathan Loynes said oil prices, which drove October input prices higher, have declined significantly over the month and will drag November's prices down.</p>
<p>&quot;But input prices normally rise sharply in November as the cold weather generally forces up oil prices. Accordingly, seasonally adjusted prices should fall even further,&quot; he said, forecasting a 2.0 percent month-on-month decline.</p>
<p>The annual rate of decline would then reach 3.6 percent, the greatest since March 1991, Loynes said.</p>
<p>Philip Uglow, economist at Union Plc, said a 9.6 percent decline in oil prices in November would more than offset a one percent rise in general commodity prices.</p>
<p>&quot;All in all, we expect to see input prices fall 0.8 percent in November, leaving them 2.4 percent below levels a year ago,&quot; Uglow said.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley economist Mark Miller said sterling's steady appreciation would also help push input prices lower.</p>
<p>&quot;The fall in input prices is temporary to the extent of that factor. Commodity prices are starting to pick up a little bit now,&quot; Miller said.</p>
<p>&quot;Output prices are still fully benign, but the trend might be starting to bottom out. There is probably a margins story coming through soon with a recovery in manufacturing, and we might expect to see producers' output prices go up soon.&quot;</p>
<p>October data released on Friday showed manufacturing output rose 0.5 percent, both month-on-month and year-on-year while industrial output grew 1.3 percent year-on-year but was flat over the month.</p>
<p>&quot;The other implication is a strong story for corporate profits in 1997,&quot; Miller said. &quot;If manufacturing picks up strongly, as we expect it will, average earnings will certainly trend upwards as unit wage costs drift down.&quot;</p>
<p>Economists said the growth in producer output prices would take time to filter through to retail prices, and was unlikely to affect interest rates in the short term.</p>
<p>&quot;The upward trend in output prices will put upward pressure on interest rates next year. The main factor will, of course, be domestic demand,&quot; Miller said.</p>
