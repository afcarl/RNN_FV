Hong Kong stocks in London down on bumpy trading.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Hong Kong stocks in London were down on Friday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's anti-inflation comments caused the market to nosedive in the morning and benign U.S. payroll figures later prompted a recovery, traders said.

The Hang Seng London Index closed down 190.07 points at 12,912.66 from Thursday's close of 13,102.73.

The Hang Seng Index ended at 13,102.73 from the previous close of 13466.02.

"There was actually some volume today and it looks quite stable now," said one trader shortly before the day's close.

The Hang Seng London Index dropped to low of 12,750.24 this morning and then rallied to the close.

"Guys were panicking to get out of stuff...and there was nobody on bid," said one marketmaker on the effect of Greenspan's comments on morning trade.

"The (U.S.) bond market recovered and everything went back up again in the afternoon," said the marketmaker.

The market will be all ears for Greenspan's next public engagement set for 1715 GMT, traders said.

"The Hong Kong stocks have been following the (U.S.) bond market tick for tick," said the marketmaker.
