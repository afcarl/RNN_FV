<title>UK: CLOSING DOLLAR REPORT.</title>
<headline>CLOSING DOLLAR REPORT.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The dollar ended more than a pfennig lower here compared with Thursday's close, caught in the crossfire of the sharp losses in both U.S. stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>Asset markets were roiled by comments late Thursday from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, who spoke of how central banks could manage to successfully puncture asset market bubbles. This raised concerns about an imminent U.S. interest rate rise and sent the bond martket into a tailspin.</p>
<p>News today, however, of a lower-than-expected rise 118,000 rise in U.S November non-farm payrolls calmed asset markets and allowed the dollar to recover half of its overnight losses.</p>
<p>&quot;The general backdrop of asset market uncertainty at this time of year is not good news for the dollar because it encourages a paring of extreme positioning in all markets at a time when funds are still net long of dollars,&quot; said Klaus Baader, currency strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>There also tends to be preference for low-inflation &quot;safe haven&quot; cash, traditionally marks and Swiss francs, during such market upheavals, as well as a drift away from the markets of large net debtor countries such as the U.S., Baader said.</p>
<p>At 1630 GMT, the dollar was trading 1.5450/55 marks compared with 1.5515/22 marks on Thursday and an intraday low at 1.5485.</p>
<p>Some economists said the softer-than-expected headline rise in U.S. payrolls was not as benign as the rest of the employment report suggested. Upward revisions to October and September payrolls and a rise in average hourly earnings helped offset any headline softness. This leaves the background risk of a rise in U.S. rates in the coming months very much alive.</p>
<p>Yet, while sharp losses in stocks and bonds would tend to undermine the currency in the short-term, expectations of a higher interest rates and a higher relative return on U.S. assets should also support it. Others say the U.S. will not be the currency market focus next week anyway.</p>
<p>To some extent, the dollar/mark moves over the past 24 hours are more indicative of repositioning on European currencies than the U.S. unit itself. The relative stability of dollar/yen today, for example, is a case in point.</p>
<p>Moreover, Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen said today that the recent dollar/mark gains were not to do with some renewed strength in the U.S. unit but rather a bout of weakness in the European currency bloc.</p>
<p>Bundesbank concern about any fresh mark appreciation was illustrated by reports of Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer's description of the dollar's retreat today as &quot;exaggerated.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think the story will return quickly to Europe ahead of the Dublin EU summit next weekend,&quot; said Julian Jessop, economist at Nikko Europe. &quot;Hopes of a budget stability pact at the meeting will increase EMU optimism again and weigh on the mark ultimately.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One thing that's for sure is that all ministers going to the summit will want to see the dollar higher and the mark weaker and any comments around the meeting will be spun that way,&quot; said Jessop, who said dollar/mark could well bounce back above 1.55 early next week.</p>
