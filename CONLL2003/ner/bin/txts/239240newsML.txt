Market could absorb more official gold sales.

LONDON 1996-12-06

The gold market could "just possibly" absorb a lot more bullion sales by central banks of the kind that have hurt gold prices recently, according to market researchers CRU International.

"For all the talk of central bank activity, sales from official sources have not been that large and they have barely offset the decline in gold exported by the Russian authorities," December's CRU Precious Metals Monitor said.

Gold coming on to the market from Russia, the central banks and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during the 1990s has little more than averaged that during the 1980s and is less than the figures seen in the 1970s.

"Whether it can absorb more talk of them (official sales) is another matter!" the report said.

CRU also noted that the range of central bankers apparently willing "to think the unthinkable and say so" was widening.

Most tellingly were recent comments from Swiss National Bank officials mildly questioning the role of gold.

"It was eight years ago this month that the Belgian National Bank formally ended the link with gold in a precursor to a series of big bullion sales," CRU noted.

It also highlight comments from a recent report on central bank intervention policy stating that the $215 billion of gold reserves held by the central banks had "virtually no value" in interventions in the foreign exchange market.

The gold market was insufficiently liquid to handle the volumes intervention would normally require.

"None of this is to suggest that a big mobilisation of Swiss or other reserves is not still a long way down the road. But it is clearly a road with only one destination," CRU said.

It also noted that most of the recent producer sales were coming from Australia after the cherished level of A$500 per ounce had not been achieved.

"With the average level of hedging down from 24 months to 12-15 mnonths, the danger is that currency weakness or a rally in gold will trigger yet another round of sales," it said.

With consumer interest still subdued, CRU forecast prices in a range "no better" than $355-$375 in the near term.

"In today's nervous market, psychology can turn quickly. The mere absence of bad news would allow prices to stablise, consumer confidence to rebuild and buyers to return," the report said.
