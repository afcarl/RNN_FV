WEEK AHEAD - Markets volatile as rate cut hopes dim.

Financial markets are likely to remain volatile next week after U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's salvo against "irrational exuberance", analysts said on Friday.

Ken Wattret, international economist at Paribas Capital Markets, said markets, especially in European bonds, were set to continue the erratic behaviour of this week, which has seen sharp sell-offs after strong rallies.

"This kind of thing often happens towards the end of the year, but this time we are looking for it to spread into 1997," he said.

"After the November U.S. non-farm payrolls data, the probability remains intact that Greenspan's comments hint at a tighter rather than looser monetary stance."

Wattret also cited Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen's comment that he saw no need for monetary policy to prop up economic growth as a further knock to lingering market hopes for lower German interest rates.

Stephen King, economist at HBSC James Capel, said Wednesday's November producer price index (PPI) and Thursday's consumer price index (CPI) and retail sales figures would give a crucial indication of the strength of the U.S. economy.

"Weak data next week could calm things down a bit, but if we get upturns in prices in CPI, PPI and retail sales that would be quite bearish from the point of view of the bond market," King said.

The European Union summit in Dublin on December 13/14 will be a main focus for markets next week as they look to the fate of a proposed stability pact to judge prospects for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).

"The big story will be political developments and the progress of the stability pact," said Julian Jessop, chief European economist at Nikko Europe in London.

The pact, on which Germany has appeared alone in taking a hard line, seeks to ensure continued budgetary discipline after the start of EMU in January 1999, so as to bolster the strength of the new euro single currency.

German Chancellor Helmut Kohl meets French President Jacques Chirac in Nuremberg on Monday to prepare for Dublin.

EU finance ministers meet on the eve of the summit, aiming for a full pact accord which eluded them in Brussels this week.

"(Failure) would mean a renewed mark fall on expectations the euro will be much weaker than the mark," said Jessop.

"Conversely, dollar strength would be good for the short end of some markets, particularly France," he said.

Jessop said the focus in Italy would be on interest rates. Following a call on Thursday by Prime Minister Romano Prodi for commercial banks to lower their rates, the chairman of the Italian Banking Association Tancredi Bianchi said he saw room for a drop in rates.

"The Bank of Italy is dragging its feet, and feels it's up to the commercial banks to cut," said Jessop. "But it's a chicken and egg situation. It will only happen if the commercial banks think another BOI cut is on the way."

King said Britain's retail price index (RPI) on Thursday and France's consumer confidence index on Wednesday would also be important for European markets.

Elsewhere markets would also be closely watching comments by Japanese officials about the yen rather than specific financial data, he said.
