<p>Financial markets are likely to remain volatile next week after U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's salvo against &quot;irrational exuberance&quot;, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>Ken Wattret, international economist at Paribas Capital Markets, said markets, especially in European bonds, were set to continue the erratic behaviour of this week, which has seen sharp sell-offs after strong rallies.</p>
<p>&quot;This kind of thing often happens towards the end of the year, but this time we are looking for it to spread into 1997,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;After the November U.S. non-farm payrolls data, the probability remains intact that Greenspan's comments hint at a tighter rather than looser monetary stance.&quot;</p>
<p>Wattret also cited Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen's comment that he saw no need for monetary policy to prop up economic growth as a further knock to lingering market hopes for lower German interest rates.</p>
<p>Stephen King, economist at HBSC James Capel, said Wednesday's November producer price index (PPI) and Thursday's consumer price index (CPI) and retail sales figures would give a crucial indication of the strength of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Weak data next week could calm things down a bit, but if we get upturns in prices in CPI, PPI and retail sales that would be quite bearish from the point of view of the bond market,&quot; King said.</p>
<p>The European Union summit in Dublin on December 13/14 will be a main focus for markets next week as they look to the fate of a proposed stability pact to judge prospects for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).</p>
<p>&quot;The big story will be political developments and the progress of the stability pact,&quot; said Julian Jessop, chief European economist at Nikko Europe in London.</p>
<p>The pact, on which Germany has appeared alone in taking a hard line, seeks to ensure continued budgetary discipline after the start of EMU in January 1999, so as to bolster the strength of the new euro single currency.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl meets French President Jacques Chirac in Nuremberg on Monday to prepare for Dublin.</p>
<p>EU finance ministers meet on the eve of the summit, aiming for a full pact accord which eluded them in Brussels this week.</p>
<p>&quot;(Failure) would mean a renewed mark fall on expectations the euro will be much weaker than the mark,&quot; said Jessop.</p>
<p>&quot;Conversely, dollar strength would be good for the short end of some markets, particularly France,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jessop said the focus in Italy would be on interest rates. Following a call on Thursday by Prime Minister Romano Prodi for commercial banks to lower their rates, the chairman of the Italian Banking Association Tancredi Bianchi said he saw room for a drop in rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank of Italy is dragging its feet, and feels it's up to the commercial banks to cut,&quot; said Jessop. &quot;But it's a chicken and egg situation. It will only happen if the commercial banks think another BOI cut is on the way.&quot;</p>
<p>King said Britain's retail price index (RPI) on Thursday and France's consumer confidence index on Wednesday would also be important for European markets.</p>
<p>Elsewhere markets would also be closely watching comments by Japanese officials about the yen rather than specific financial data, he said.</p>
