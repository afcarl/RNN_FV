<headline>FORECAST - Scottish Hydro looks to future.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Vertically-integrated electricity company Scottish Hydro-Electric should see half year profits up 10 percent or so on December 12 and raise its dividend, but analysts will want details on future strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;The big story really is what Scottish Hydro will do with its money,&quot; said one analyst who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>The company has around 500 million stg to spend, analysts said, and could choose investments, shareholder benefits or a mixture of the two.  </p>
<p>Pre-tax profits for the six months are expected to come in between 63 and 70.7 million stg compared with 61.7 million stg a year ago while the dividend should be around 5.2 pence, up from 4.75 pence previously.</p>
<p>&quot;The vision thing, that is what the market will look for,&quot; said the analyst.</p>
<p>Scottish Hydro saw the supply business of British Gas in Scotland and northern England slip through its hands when talks between the two companies broke down in September.</p>
<p>But analysts said these might not be ruled out as British Gas moves towards demerging its supply business.  </p>
<p>Scottish Hydro has ruled out buying a regional electricity company (Rec) or water and sewerage company and analysts said it was likely to focus on investment in generating assets.</p>
<p>It has discussed taking full control of the Keadby power station near Scunthorpe, north east England, which it currently owns in a 50:50 joint venture with United Utilities.</p>
<p>Analysts said the company might invest more in independent power projects and combined heat and power (CHP) schemes as a means of increasing its presence in generation.  </p>
<p>At the same time, it might decide to return some cash to shareholders through special dividends or a buyback, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;But it might want to hang on to some funds in case those British Gas talks light up again,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
