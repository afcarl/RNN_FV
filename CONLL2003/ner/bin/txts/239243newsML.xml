<headline>&quot;Missing&quot; Brent Walker man gets 2 years -SFO.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Donald Anderson, former finance director of film and TV company Goldcrest, has been sentenced to two years imprisonment, Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said on Friday.</p>
<p>An SFO official told Reuters that Anderson, who on Thursday was found guilty by a London court of perverting the course of justice, had also been disqualified from acting as a company director for five years.</p>
<p>Anderson was finance director when Goldcrest was a subsidiary of leisure and entertainment group Brent Walker, then led by boxer-turned-entrepreneur George Walker.  </p>
<p>New Zealander Anderson was paid a total of 700,000 stg to cover up the creation of 19 million stg of bogus Goldcrest profits recorded in the accounts of Brent Walker.</p>
<p>This involved a complex route taking in the U.S., Switzerland and the Isle of Man.</p>
<p>He collected the payments in bearer bonds and cash in Geneva, including sums laundered through the Bahamas and Lichenstein.</p>
<p>Anderson, 43, fled Britain in 1992 but surrendered to British police in November 1995. He was not in Britain in the summer of 1994 during the trial of Walker, who was cleared of a fraud charge concerning the same false profits.</p>
<p>While Walker was cleared of fraud, Wilfred Aquilina, former finance director of Brent Walker, was convicted of a false accounting charge involving 4.5 million stg.</p>
