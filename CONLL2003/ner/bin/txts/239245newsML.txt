FTSE 100 closes with biggest point loss since 1992.

LONDON 1996-12-06

UK shares suffered their biggest one-day loss in four years on Friday as world markets tumbled following surprise anti-inflation comments from U.S. Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan.

Yet shares had rallied from their earlier sharp decline by the close, as Wall Street steadied and a benign U.S. jobs report eased the market's interest rate fears.

The FTSE 100 closed 88.2 points lower at 3,963.0, the biggest one-day loss since October 1992, wiping some 15 billion stg off its value.
