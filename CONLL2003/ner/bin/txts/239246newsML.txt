UK Exchange to start electronic trading in Oct '97.

LONDON 1996-12-06

The London Stock Exchange said on Friday it planned to launch electronic trading for FTSE 100 stocks on October 20, 1997.

The outline schedule includes a period for practical simulation and market testing and the target date is to be reconfirmed three months ahead of implementation.

The market is expected to begin a comprehensive programme of testing in May and member firms will be required to have participated in full dress rehearsals by September 1997.  

"On the basis of our discussions with members, we have set a working launch date which we believe is challenging but achievable. It is essential, however, that the process leading to introduction of the order book is thorough and comprehensive," the Exchange said.

To that end, it said, it had identified a series of milestones through which it could monitor progress and reconfirm the target date in the light of market readiness.

The launch date is geared to meet the market's need for nine months preparation time after publication of the final specification for the new trading service.  

Revised rules for the new trading structure will be circulated for comment later this month and final rules confirmed to the market together with a final service description and technical specification in January.
