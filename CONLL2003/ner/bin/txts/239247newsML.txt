UK lacks price stability credibility - EIB president.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Financial markets have yet to be convinced about Britain's ability to maintain price stability, the European Investment Bank president told Reuters on Friday.

"The United Kingdom is performing well now but it is a comparatively recent achievement. As we look back over the past 20 to 30 years, there's a credibility problem," EIB president Brian Unwin said in an interview.

Unwin, who unreservedly expected European economic and monetary union to begin in 1999 with an unspecified number of countries, said nations such as Italy and Spain seeking to join in 1999 had gained credibility and were benefiting from it.

"The markets continue to find EMU credible and are making judgments on the basis EMU will go ahead," Unwin said, noting government bond yield differentials over Bunds for Italy and Spain had narrowed very substantially in the past year.
