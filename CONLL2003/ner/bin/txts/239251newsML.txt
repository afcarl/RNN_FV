Prism Rail promises 24.8 mln stg to OPRF.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Prism Rail said on Friday that it would be able to make a premium payment of 24.8 million stg to the franchising office in 2004 by operating the West Anglia/Great Northern rail franchise.

Prism Rail, a company specifically formed to tender for passenger rail services being privatised in Britain, had confirmed the contract early on Friday.

Prism needs capital of around 19 million stg which it said would be partly funded out of a proposed rights issue with the balance being met out of bank facilities.

The company said it would receive support of 52.9 million stg from the franchising director.

This represents an average support payment of 12.7 million stg per annum over the life of the franchise.

Prism Rail said it had committed to spend around 14 million stg improving station customer facilities, information systems and refurbishing rolling stock.

Franchising director John O'Brien said that as on Friday 72 percent of the country's rail network, in passenger revenue terms, had been awarded to private operators.
