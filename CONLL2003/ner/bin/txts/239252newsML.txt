Korean corporations increasingly target EU - UNCTAD.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Korean trans-national corporations (TNCs) are looking more to Europe as an investment destination, hoping to secure market share and access new technology, a report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said.

UNCTAD said foreign direct investment (FDI) from Korea into Europe stood at $611 million in 1995 against $144 million in 1992.

"While North America remains their main investment location beyond Asia, the European Union has gathered momentum as a target for their activities," UNCTAD said.

About 10 percent of Korean FDI is now located in Europe and Korean firms have also started big projects in Central and eastern Europe which are not yet reflected in available data.

Most Korean FDI abroad is undertaken by large industrial conglomerates "which are among the most globalised TNCs from Asian developing economies", UNCTAD said.

The UK is the most favoured destination in the EU, with two projects recently announced in Wales.

Sectorally, Korean investment has shifted over the last couple of years from trading activities to specific manufacturing industries. Nearly three quarters of its FDI in Europe is in electrical and electronic products, UNCTAD noted.

A detailed analysis of Asian FDI in Europe is to be released by UNCTAD in January.
