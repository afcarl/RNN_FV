Northern Electric rejects increased CE offer.

LONDON 1996-12-06

British regional electricity company Northern Electric on Friday advised shareholders to reject an increased offer at 650 pence per share from predator CE Electric of the U.S.

In a statement, Northern said CE Electric's new bid, 20 pence above its first offer, "represents an inadequate premium for control."
