Japanese stocks fall in aggressive London trading.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Leading Japanese shares in London fell on Friday in rollercoaster trading, but recovered slightly by the afternoon from the effect of the downtrend in world stock markets.

At 1615 GMT London's Nikkei 50 index was down 41.01 points at 1443.31, a 2.76 percent slide which cancelled out Thursday's gains. Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed down 667.20 points at 20,276.70.

Dealers reported aggressive selling of blue chip stocks like Toyota, Sony and Canon in the morning.

They said although the market opened bearish sparked by Tokyo's weak opening, there was some buying back in the afternoon after the U.S. job figures were released and Wall street's fall proved less steep than anticipated.

"We didn't get the crash we expected," said one dealer. "The U.S. figures were seen as fairly non-inflationary which rescued the situation after lunch.
