<p>The European Investment Bank's role as a lender may grow after monetary union, given the financing needs of regions and countries not at its economic core, the EIB's president told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The need for investment after EMU will be no less. In fact it could even be greater and our role (as a lender) could be enhanced,&quot; EIB president Brian Unwin told Reuters in an iterview.</p>
<p>Unwin unreservedly expected European economic and monetary union to begin in 1999 with an unspecified number of countries.</p>
<p>&quot;One effect could be a greater concentration of economic activity in certain areas within EMU countries from the periphery towards the centre.&quot;</p>
<p>Unwin said latest studies by the European Commission found that disparities between regions within the same countries were still increasing in some cases.</p>
<p>&quot;In that situation I can see the EIB might be called on to a greater extent to help finance investment in those areas...to some degree to offset the absence of grant finance.&quot;</p>
<p>The whole European Union structure of regional grants will be under review for the next two or three years as present agreements come to an end. Huge sums of grants to the regions will have to be renegotiatied. &quot;Poorer countries will press hard but larger countries, especially net payers, are unlikely to agree as generous a regime particularly when they look ahead at the potential needs of (possible future EU candidates) Slovakia, Poland and Slovenia,&quot; Unwin said.</p>
<p>Aside from lower grant-aid, Unwin said reduced government spending might require the EIB to lend more after EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;Governments are reining back their public spending and their public investment to reduce their borrowing requirement at the moment in order to meet the Maastricht criteria, but also because they think that's the right economic policy anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>Looking to countries not in EMU, Unwin said: &quot;Depending on how many are in, there is the likelihood of greater need for those outside to need help in productive investment to come up to scratch and be able to join (EMU).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The extreme example is Greece which is trying very hard but acknowledges it has a long way to go. By any standard there is a huge backlog of investment and improvement needed in Greece.&quot;</p>
