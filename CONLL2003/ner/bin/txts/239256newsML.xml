<headline>FORECAST - Electricity firms eyed for benefits.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>British regional electricity companies (Recs) Yorkshire and London should see half year profits hit by price reviews when they report next week but dividends should be strong with some extras possible.</p>
<p>Yorkshire Electricity should see half year pre-tax profits dip to between 76 and 95 million stg from 110.6 million stg previously at results on December 10, analysts said.</p>
<p>But it promised a full year dividend of 52.66 pence in August, a rise of 34 percent, which analysts are expecting to boost the interim dividend to around 15.9 pence from 11.88 pence.  </p>
<p>London Electricity should turn in half year pre-tax profits between 61.7 and 86 million stg, compared to 84.5 million, and pay out a dividend of around 13.9 pence, compared with 11.5 pence.</p>
<p>Both companies will also be eyed for a special dividend or share buyback although extras are seen more likely from Yorkshire, which has a low gearing ratio.</p>
<p>&quot;The market feels with Yorkshire it is a question of when not if they will give more benefits to shareholders, with London the situation is less clear,&quot; said one analyst who asked not to be identified.  </p>
<p>Yorkshire might also give some updates on its stake in radio telephony company Ionica, analysts said.</p>
<p>London and Yorkshire have also felt the swirl of recent bid speculation after East Midlands agreed to a 670 pence per share bid from Dominion Resources of the U.S. and Northern battles to fend off CE Electric.</p>
<p>Bid talks between London and U.S.-based Entergy Corp were called off last month but the Americans said they would be keeping an eye on the sector, while Yorkshire has made it clear it would not be averse to a bid, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Any further offers in the sector might wait for the UK government to decide whether to approve the current bids, analysts said, which should be later this month.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically at these results, no-one is interested in the businesses of these companies, they are only eyeing dividends and bids,&quot; said the analyst.</p>
