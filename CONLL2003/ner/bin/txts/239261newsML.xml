<p>MELBOURNE TO HOST 1999 WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS</p>
<p>The International Sailing Federation has decided Melbourne will host the world championship for at least nine of the 10 Olympic yachting classes on Port Phillip in January 1999.</p>
<p>It means that most of the international sailors aiming for Olympic selection will not only sail at Sail Melbourne '99 but also compete in the Sydney Pre-Olympic Regattas in 1998 and 1999 on the actual Olympic courses in Sydney.</p>
<p>All but the Tornado class will hold their world championships on Melbourne's Port Phillip with the Solings expected to run the fleet racing on the bay but then move to Sydney for the match-racing finals on Sydney Harbour.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be world championships for four other international classes conducted at the same time by yacht clubs around Port Phillip.</p>
<p>At a launch beside a windswept Port Phillip last Friday, Victorian state premier JEFF KENNETT predicted the championships would bring more than 5,000 sailors and support teams to Melbourne, sailing some 2,500 yachts, and would be worth A$30 million to the state's economy. In return, he said Victoria would spend A$1.8 million towards the organisation of the event.</p>
<p>The launch, which also marked 40 years since the 1956 Melbourne Olympics yachting was headquartered at the adjacent Royal Melbourne Yacht Squadron, was attended by Victorian members of the team which sailed at Savannah during the recent Atlanta Games. These included women's 470 skipper JENI LIDGETT and men's 470 skipper TOM KING, along with PAUL McKENZIE who finished fourth in the Finn class at Savannah.</p>
<p>PAUL, a senior accountant with KMPG, gave an exhilarating sailing display in the class in which he has won two world championships, the A-class catamaran, an international but non-Olympic class. He was also celebrating his employer's decision to continue their sponsorship of him.</p>

<p>SPONSOR FOR PORT PHILLIP REGATTA</p>
<p>The Victorian Yachting Council received more good news this week with the announcement that Hewlett-Packard will sponsor the Port Phillip Regatta in January, 1997.</p>
<p>Now in its 19th year, the Port Phillip Regatta is Victoria's premier keelboat regatta and an event in which I played a role in establishing many years back.</p>
<p>It now attracts more than 200 boats ranging from grand prix ocean racers, maxi yachts, cruising keelboats, trailable yachts and the traditional couta boats.</p>

<p>HARD CHOICE FOR AUSTRALIAN YACHTING AWARDS</p>
<p>Judges of the 1996 Australian Yachting Federation/Ronstan Australian Yachting Awards face a daunting task in selecting the winners, to be announced at a luncheon at Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron next Monday.</p>
<p>Nominations for the Australian Yachtsman of the Year cover a wide range of sailing, including several world champions in dinghy, one-design keelboat and catamaran classes, the Olympic medal winners, and skippers of the winning Kenwood Cup ocean racing team.</p>
<p>In an Olympic year, the final vote probably will be between the silver medallists in the Tornado catamaran class, MITCH BOOTH and ANDREW LANDENBERGER, and the Star class bronze medallists COLIN BEASHEL and DAVID GILES. As this was the second Olympic medal for BOOTH, although with a different craw, this could swing the ballot his way.</p>
<p>The Youth Award is also difficult and underlines the standard of our young sailors and the excellent training schemes conducted by yacht clubs around Australia.</p>
<p>Apart from the awards, it will be an interesting luncheon with speakers including GLENN BOURKE, the Olympic sailor and coach, and competition manager for sailing at the 2000 Olympics.</p>

<p>STRONG ENTRIES FOR BIG OFFSHORE RACES</p>
<p>Entries have officially closed for the three major ocean races in eastern Australian waters over the Christmas-New Year period, although each conducting club is expecting the odd late entry and late withdrawal.</p>
<p>The Cruising Yacht Club of Australia's fleet for the Telstra Sydney-Hobart has ended at 95 yachts, with a couple of late entries and several late decisions not to compete.</p>
<p>Although down on last year, the fleet sailing under the IMS (International Measurement System) must rank among the best in the world, equal to the Kenwood Cup in Hawaii except for a couple of yachts.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for the smaller Sydney-Hobart fleet is that so many Victorian yachts are contesting the Ocean Racing Club of Victoria's 25th annual Melbourne-Hobart, with 74 yachts entered for the West Coaster.</p>
<p>In Sydney, the Royal Prince Alfred Yacht Club has so far received more than 80 entries for its 225 nautical mile warm water alternative race from Pittwater to Coffs Harbour. Sponsored by Strathfield Car Radios, it starts on December 27.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, SYD FISCHER's Farr 50, Ragamuffin, has strengthened her position as favourite for IMS handicap honours in the Sydney-Hobart with a consistent performance to win the IMS racer division of last week's hard-fought Bruce &amp; Walsh regatta conducted by Middle Harbour Yacht Club.</p>
<p>However, the yacht to beat if the Sydney-Hobart turns out to be a light weather race could be the little Victorian 30-footer Atria, which her designer ROBERT HICK sailed into first place in the opening two races of the regatta. Also impressive were the Queensland champion No Fearr, owned by Townsville businessman CAREY RAMM, which won the IMS cruiser/racer division narrowly from the revamped IAIN MURRAY-designed Zoe, by Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron member IVAN WHEEN.</p>
<p>Zoe had America's Cup sailor PETER GILMOUR at the helm for the first two races, in which she gained a first and a second, and GILMOUR is expected to be steering in Sydney's offshore regatta starting on December 17.</p>

<p>LEADING SAILORS JOIN AYF BOARD</p>
<p>The Australian Yachting Federation has taken significant steps towards streamlining its administrative structure with the appointment of three well-known sailors - LEIGH MINEHAN, IAIN MURRAY and GRANT SIMMER - to its seven-member board.</p>
<p>They will join the four members already elected by state yachting authorities - BRUCE DICKSON (NSW), BOB LUCAS (Vic), DON NICKELS (WA) and DAVID TILLETT (SA).</p>
<p>DICKSON has been appointed president but will continue his honorary role as acting executive officer until the new board chooses a new general manager for Australia's governing body of sailing. This will happen before the end of the year.</p>
<p>DICKSON, a past commodore of the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron, and LUCAS, a former commodore of the Royal Geelong Yacht Club, along with NICKELS and TILLETT, come from the traditional club and state yachting authority administration background, as does MINEHAN, a past commodore of the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia.</p>
<p>However, MINEHAN, a senior partner in Coopers Lybrand, who has been elected as treasurer, brings to the board wide experience in sponsorship negotiations and, of course, financial management.</p>
<p>MURRAY and SIMMER will make an important hands-on approach as active international sailors and in the field of state-of-the-art yacht design and sailmaking techniques.</p>
<p>MURRAY, who has won 11 world championships and competed in four America's Cups, heads the successful design firm, Iain Murray &amp; Associates and is a director of the sports marketing and management company, The Kookaburra Group. He has designed the winners of the last two Sydney-Hobart races and many other inshore and offshore yachts.</p>
<p>SIMMER, who was navigator of America's Cup winner Australia II in 1983, has remained one of Australia's leading one-design and offshore sailors. He is a director of North Sails (Aust).</p>
<p>His appointment to the AYF board is significant in that he has been a prominent member of Australian Offshore, a group formed last year to represent ocean racing yacht owners and leading crew who were dissatisfied with the AYF's administration of offshore yachting.</p>
