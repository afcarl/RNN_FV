Motor Racing-Jordan excited ahead of 1997 GP seaso.

DUBLIN 1996-12-06

Team chief, Eddie Jordan, said on Friday he was excited at the prospect of 1992 world champion Nigel Mansell driving for Jordan Grand Prix in 1997.

"I am excited by the thought. He (Mansell) at the end of the day has won 31 Grand Prix races. He is a very big name and a very good draw," Jordan said.

"I hope that he enjoys his couple of days with us next week. It is too early to say if anything will come out of it, I'm just pleased that he has asked Jordan to allow him drive the car," he added.

After a six-hour meeting at Jordan's headquarters involving the driver and Jordan on Wednesday, the parties issued a statement saying Briton Mansell would test drive a car in Spain on December 11 and 12. Mansell, 44 next year, has not driven a Formula One car in earnest since his short-lived spell with the McLaren team in 1995.

Jordan have already signed Ralf Schumacher, 21, younger brother of double world champion Michael of Germany, as one of their drivers for next season, but have yet to decide on a second driver.

If the test goes to plan, Mansell could be considered as a rival to fellow-Briton Martin Brundle for the second-seat.

"We have a very young driver, he is just 21, in Ralf Schumacher. We have to be very careful to nurture him. He is, if you like, our pensioner," Jordan said. "To support that, what you don't need, in my opinion, is a very young other driver who is either crashing the car or is doing things that is draining the efforts or the time, funding or whatever of the overall project. We need a relatively experienced driver," he added.
