Horse Racing-Imperial Call set for seasonal bow.

DUBLIN 1996-12-06

Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Imperial Call will make his eagerly-awaited seasonal bow in the Grade One MMI Stockbrokers Steeplechase at Punchestown, County Kildare, on Saturday.

Ireland's Gold Cup hero was slightly injured in a gallop at Clonmel, southern Ireland, in November but he has fully recovered.

Imperial Call, the 7-4 favourite, faces stiff competition for honours in the 35,000 Irish pounds two-and-a-half miles (4-km) presentation from Arthur Moore's Klairon Davis (5-2) winner of the Queen Mother Champion Chase at Cheltenham in March.

Klairon Davis was beaten by Enda Bolger-trained Fiftysevenchannels on his seasonal debut at Leopardstown last month but Moore said he was happy with the performance then and he expects his stable-star to have come on for that run.

The six runner field for Saturday's feature race also includes Jim Dreaper-trained Merry Gale (3-1). Dreaper will be looking for a big-run from his stable-star after two indifferent performances, at Clonmel and Naas respectively, already this season.

The remainder of the field is made up by Royal Mountbrowne (10-1), Time For A Run (14-1) and Love The Lord (25-1)
