Cricket-Pakistan set New Zealand tough target. [CORRECTED 14:11 GMT]

SIALKOT, Pakistan 1996-12-06

Helped by a record opening stand between Saeed Anwar and Zahoor Elahi, Pakistan's batsmen set New Zealand a tough victory target of 278 in the second one-day international on Friday.

Pakistan, one up in the three-match series, scored 277 in 47 overs at 5.92 runs an over after Wasim Akram won the toss, chose to bat and watched his openers put on a fluent 177 (corrects from 178) in 29 overs.

The 50-overs game was reduced by three overs after the start was delayed by a wet outfield following heavy overnight dew.

Saeed made an excellent 91 (corrects from 90), hitting 11 fours off 114 balls. Elahi hit his top one-day score of 86 (corrects from 87) as the pair gave their side a brilliant start on a flat wicket.

Elahi, playing only his third one-day international, smashed five sixes and seven fours in a whirlwind knock of 84 balls.

The partnership broke the previous best of 97 between Aamir Sohail and Anwar in East London in the 1994 triangular series in South Africa.

The other main scorer was Ijaz Ahmad who cracked a robust 59 off 47 balls with two sixes and four fours.

Medium-pacer Chris Harris sliced through Pakistan's middle order to finish with five for 42 for his best one-day figures.
