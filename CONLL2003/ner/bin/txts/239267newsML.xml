<p>Helped by a record opening stand between Saeed Anwar and Zahoor Elahi, Pakistan's batsmen set New Zealand a tough victory target of 278 in the second one-day international on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan, one up in the three-match series, scored 277 in 47 overs at 5.92 runs an over after Wasim Akram won the toss, chose to bat and watched his openers put on a fluent 177 (corrects from 178) in 29 overs.</p>
<p>The 50-overs game was reduced by three overs after the start was delayed by a wet outfield following heavy overnight dew.</p>
<p>Saeed made an excellent 91 (corrects from 90), hitting 11 fours off 114 balls. Elahi hit his top one-day score of 86 (corrects from 87) as the pair gave their side a brilliant start on a flat wicket.</p>
<p>Elahi, playing only his third one-day international, smashed five sixes and seven fours in a whirlwind knock of 84 balls.</p>
<p>The partnership broke the previous best of 97 between Aamir Sohail and Anwar in East London in the 1994 triangular series in South Africa.</p>
<p>The other main scorer was Ijaz Ahmad who cracked a robust 59 off 47 balls with two sixes and four fours.</p>
<p>Medium-pacer Chris Harris sliced through Pakistan's middle order to finish with five for 42 for his best one-day figures.</p>
