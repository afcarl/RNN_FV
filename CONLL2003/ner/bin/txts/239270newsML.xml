<p>Canadian financial markets posted sharp declines for a second straight session Friday, although many markets pared losses by the close of trade, following Thursday's so-called &quot;made-in-Canada meltdown.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said Friday's losses stemmed mainly from weak U.S. markets, which weighed on Canadian bonds, stocks and currency.</p>
<p>&quot;The negative sentiment that's occurring in the U.S. is clearly the big catalyst today,&quot; said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist with Bank of Montreal.</p>
<p>Canadian stocks, bonds and the currency all opened sharply lower Friday, extending losses from Thursday's broad-based sell-off.</p>
<p>Although Canadian bonds experienced the most severe losses Thursday, Canadian saw the worst declines early Friday.</p>
<p>The benchmark Toronto Stock Exchange 300 index fell more than 1 percent at the open, then lost almost 3 percent of its value. Leading the index lower was the heavily weighted interest-sensitive financial services subgroup.</p>
<p>The TSE index closed down 31.69 points at 5,810.06 after falling as much as 170 points earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar also weakened severely Friday morning, falling past C$1.3600 (73.53 cents) and prompting the Bank of Canada to buy the Canadian dollar on currency markets for the third time this week. The dollar closed at C$1.3590 (73.59).</p>
<p>Canadian bonds dropped sharply at the open. The benchmark 30-year bonds fell C$1.75 to C$109.10 to yield 7.224 percent in early trade, after experiencing its biggest one-day loss in more than two years Thursday.</p>
<p>Canadian bonds rallied during the session to close stronger, with the benchmark 30-year bond up C25 cents to C$110.95 to yield 7.078 percent at the end of trading.</p>
<p>Unlike Thursday's session, in which various causes were blamed for the sell-off, analysts attributed much of Friday's early weakness to comments Thursday night by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. In a speech, Greenspan commented on &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in financial markets.</p>
<p>Canadian stocks and the dollar were especially hurt by Greenspan's remarks, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think everybody rushed for the exit (from Canadian stocks) at the same time,&quot; said Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc. investment strategist Michael Metz. &quot;Greenspan's remarks suggested the markets are inflated.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada's dollar weakened overnight after the speech. The dollar's overnight weakness prompted the Bank of England to intervene on currency markets on behalf of the Bank of Canada.</p>
<p>Greenspan's comments sparked concerns that the Fed could soon raise U.S. rates, which would make Canadian Treasury bills less attractive and likely weaken the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Economists and analysts attributed much of the rebound in Canadian financial markets to the fact that the country's positive fundamentals, such as low inflation and improving government finances, remained in place.</p>
<p>The fundamentals for the currency and bonds were particularly positive, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe Canada represents a great opportunity,&quot; said Thomas Juterbock, managing director of government bond trading at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Inc. &quot;Canada represents a fabulous opportunity to be long relative to the U.S.&quot;</p>
<p>Equity analysts also said that despite the roller coaster ride in Toronto's stock market, its key index would resume its upward march and continue to outperform Wall Street in the new year.</p>
