----------------------MARKET COMMENT--------------------------

* The Canadian dollar ended weaker again Friday at C$1.3590 (US$0.7359) from Thursday's close at C$1.3563 (US$0.7373) in volatile and thin trading, dealers said.

* The currency weakened sharply overnight and this morning along with poor performance in the Canadian and U.S. bond markets, but was able to recover slightly in the afternoon.  

The Bank of England intervened on behalf of the Bank of Canada as the Canadian dollar weakened past C$1.3600 (US$0.7353), dealers said.

The currency was able to regain some strength later in Friday's session after U.S. non-farm payroll numbers came in weaker than expected.

The U.S. Labor Department said that November non-farm payrolls rose by 118,000 against a revised 224,000 in the previous month. Experts had expected payrolls to advance by 179,000 in November. The payroll numbers were seen as positive by currency traders.  

"It (the jobs data) allowed the Canadian dollar to come back from the high we saw last night," Wateridge said.

But he expected the currency to soften again in European and Asian markets before Monday's open in North America, as investors test the Bank of Canada's resolve to intervene.

"We're not out of the mire," he said.

On the crosses, the Canadian dollar dropped to 1.1371 marks from Thursday's close at 1.1425 marks, but rose to 83.06 yen from Thursday's 82.74 yen.
