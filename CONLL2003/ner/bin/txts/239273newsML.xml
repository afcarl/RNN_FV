<p>----------------------MARKET COMMENT--------------------------</p>
<p>* The Canadian dollar ended weaker again Friday at C$1.3590 (US$0.7359) from Thursday's close at C$1.3563 (US$0.7373) in volatile and thin trading, dealers said.</p>
<p>* The currency weakened sharply overnight and this morning along with poor performance in the Canadian and U.S. bond markets, but was able to recover slightly in the afternoon.  </p>
<p>The Bank of England intervened on behalf of the Bank of Canada as the Canadian dollar weakened past C$1.3600 (US$0.7353), dealers said.</p>
<p>The currency was able to regain some strength later in Friday's session after U.S. non-farm payroll numbers came in weaker than expected.</p>
<p>The U.S. Labor Department said that November non-farm payrolls rose by 118,000 against a revised 224,000 in the previous month. Experts had expected payrolls to advance by 179,000 in November. The payroll numbers were seen as positive by currency traders.  </p>
<p>&quot;It (the jobs data) allowed the Canadian dollar to come back from the high we saw last night,&quot; Wateridge said.</p>
<p>But he expected the currency to soften again in European and Asian markets before Monday's open in North America, as investors test the Bank of Canada's resolve to intervene.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not out of the mire,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On the crosses, the Canadian dollar dropped to 1.1371 marks from Thursday's close at 1.1425 marks, but rose to 83.06 yen from Thursday's 82.74 yen.</p>
