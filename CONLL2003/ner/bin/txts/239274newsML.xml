<p>Arakis Energy Corp. said Friday long-awaited joint venture deal to develop its oil concessions in Sudan, valued at more than $1 billion, will proceed without a U.S.-based oil company as a partner.</p>
<p>Arakis Chief Executive John McLeod said in an interview that political tension between Sudan and the United States was the main reason behind the potential U.S. partner, which was widely seen to be Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp., being absent from the roster of international players.</p>
<p>&quot;In the end, politics won,&quot; McLeod said.</p>
<p>Arakis's joint venture deal drew mixed reviews from analysts. Analysts said the absence of a U.S.-based company in the consortium would be viewed by some investors as a loss of potential increased credibility for the project.</p>
<p>Also, the 25 percent stake for the Canadian company -- it had hoped for 40 percent to 50 percent -- means a decreased portion of the project's estimated huge oil reserves.</p>
<p>However, a roster without U.S. participation may have averted future negative political ramifications for the project amid increasingly tense relations between the United States and strife-torn Sudan.</p>
<p>&quot;It's perhaps perceived as negative that there's no American company or major company in there that might have moved more quickly with the project,&quot; said Bill Magee, analyst with Toronto-based Credifinance Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The good news for Arakis is that they're required to put up no more money for an extended period of time, so they're extremely strong now financially.&quot;</p>
<p>Magee also welcomed the acceleration of exploration on the 12.2 million-acre Heglig and Unity Concession in southern Sudan, where Arakis has collected seismic data on only about a third of the lands.</p>
<p>Arakis said it formed a consortium to proceed with exploration and development of its oil concession in Sudan and construction of a 950-mile pipeline to the Red Sea from the Heglig and Unity fields in the North African country.</p>
<p>The partners included Arakis with 25 percent, China National Petroleum Corp. with 40 percent, Malaysia state-owned oil company Petronas Caligali with 30 percent and Sudan's government with 5 percent.</p>
<p>More than 12 million Arakis shares traded Friday, and the stock went on a wild ride after the announcement, climbing as high as $6.6875 and as low as $4.875 before closing unchanged at $5.5625.</p>
<p>Arakis has tried for a year to set up a conventional industry joint venture for the project after a financing deal collapsed in 1995, sending its shares into a tailspin and forcing previous management out.</p>
<p>McLeod has said he was confortable with estimates of the concession's reserves of 600 million barrels and said Friday the total could be many times that.</p>
<p>Magee said his firm's judgment was that the total could be &quot;several times 1.5 million&quot; barrels because of the lack of extensive seismic and the current exploration focusing just on shallow areas.</p>
