<p>The Toronto stock market ended weaker on Friday, but recovered most of its losses after sinking nearly three percent on comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.</p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index fell 31.69 points to close 5810.06 after experiencing its worst intra-day decline in nine years.</p>
<p>The key index sank 171 points, the most severe fall since a 176.5-point decline on October 22, 1987.</p>
<p>Trading was moderate with 80.8 million shares changing hands worth C$1.4 billion (US$1.03 billion).</p>
<p>&quot;For a volatile market that has been looking for a reason, any reason, to correct, last night's comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan were just the ticket,&quot; RBC Dominion Securities analyst Dunnery Best said in a report.</p>
<p>In a speech Thursday night, Greenspan warned that &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; was infecting financial markets, sparking heavy selling in equities markets worldwide.</p>
<p>By the end of Friday's session, Toronto recovered most of its losses, while the Dow Jones average lost 55.16 points.</p>
<p>Analysts said mutual fund institutions were bargain hunting on the TSE today.</p>
<p>&quot;Canadian institutions came in late in the day and established themselves for the RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) season,&quot; said Jim Doak, investment research director of ScotiaMcleod Inc.</p>
<p>Despite Toronto's steep decline, analysts expect the Canadian market to resume its upward march and outperform Wall Street in 1997.</p>
<p>All of Toronto's 14 sub-indices lost ground except pipelines and industrial products. Declining stocks outnumbered advances 705 to 320, while 259 traded flat.</p>
<p>Among hot stocks, Bre-X Minerals Ltd. rose C$0.15 to C$20.15 in heavy trading.</p>
<p>Barrick Gold Corp. is in the midst of finalizing a deal with Bre-X over ownership of Bre-X's massive gold deposit in Busang, Indonesia.</p>
<p>Barrick closed down C$0.05 at C$40.20.</p>
<p>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada's second largest bank, fell C$0.85 to C$56.15 on 1.8 million shares.</p>
<p>Fuelled by record earnings and low interest rates, bank stocks have soared to new heights since September.</p>
