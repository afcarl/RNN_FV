Guatemala seeks Canadian help to implement peace.

OTTAWA 1996-12-06

Canada is ready to help Guatemala implement its peace agreement, with troops or police if necessary, Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said on Friday.

Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein asked Axworthy for help during a meeting in Ottawa.

Canadian help could include arranging the turning in of arms and, in the longer term, in setting up such things as land registries, Stein told reporters.

A final peace accord ending Guatemala's civil war is scheduled to be signed on Dec. 29 in Guatemala City.

Axworthy said Canada was ready to help the country "show some quick results" after the agreement and to contribute troops or police if necessary.

Stein said it was important to move quickly from demobilization of armed groups to reintegrating former combatants into the economy.
