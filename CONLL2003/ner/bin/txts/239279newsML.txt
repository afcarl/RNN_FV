Placer denies in Bre-X talks.

TORONTO 1996-12-06

Placer Dome Inc has not relaunched negotiations with Bre-X Minerals Ltd for rights to the huge Busang gold deposit in Indonesia, a company spokesman said on Friday.

"We are in periodic contact with Bre-X, but there are no negotiations going on," spokesman Hugh Leggatt said in a phone interview from Vancouver.

He said a report from Jakarta that said Placer was negotiating with Bre-X to buy a 25 percent stake was "not true."  

He said his company broke off its negotiations with Bre-X last week when it became clear the Indonesian government wanted Barrick Gold Corp to control Busang.

Barrick is in the midst of finalizing a deal with Bre-X for title to the massive Busang deposit, estimated to contain at least 57 million ounces of gold. The company has a horde of lawyers and executives at work on the deal, sources said.

Barrick and Bre-X said earlier this week they had reached agreement on some issues, but other issues remain outstanding.

The Indonesian government asked Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick, the world's third largest gold company.  

The government advised Bre-X to keep keeping a 25 percent stake and Barrick to get 75 percent.

The request prompted Bre-X shareholders and Placer Dome to cry foul about the lack of an open bidding process.

But Barrick and Bre-X failed to reach an overall agreement by a December 4 deadline set by the Indonesian government.

That could leave the door open for other companies, Roland Horst, chief executive officer for Minorca Resources Inc said in an interview. Minorca has a seven percent interest in net profit from Busang production through an agreement with one of Bre-X's Indonesian partners.  

"I think there's scope for other parties to become involved," Horst said, adding he is in daily contact with company associates in Indonesia.

"If I were Placer, I'd still be talking to them (Bre-X)."

Bre-X would not comment about the bidding process.

Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said Barrick was negotiating with Bre-X in good faith and the company's status had not changed since the government-imposed deadline passed earlier this week.

Barrick and Bre-X are talking about forming a joint-venture company to operate Busang, where Barrick would offer some combination of cash, special shares and funding of the development of the mine, Borg said.

But the future of the deal depends on Indonesian mining and government officials, who are out of the country until Monday, sources said.
