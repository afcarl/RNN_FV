<headline>Placer denies in Bre-X talks.</headline>

<p>Placer Dome Inc has not relaunched negotiations with Bre-X Minerals Ltd for rights to the huge Busang gold deposit in Indonesia, a company spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in periodic contact with Bre-X, but there are no negotiations going on,&quot; spokesman Hugh Leggatt said in a phone interview from Vancouver.</p>
<p>He said a report from Jakarta that said Placer was negotiating with Bre-X to buy a 25 percent stake was &quot;not true.&quot;  </p>
<p>He said his company broke off its negotiations with Bre-X last week when it became clear the Indonesian government wanted Barrick Gold Corp to control Busang.</p>
<p>Barrick is in the midst of finalizing a deal with Bre-X for title to the massive Busang deposit, estimated to contain at least 57 million ounces of gold. The company has a horde of lawyers and executives at work on the deal, sources said.</p>
<p>Barrick and Bre-X said earlier this week they had reached agreement on some issues, but other issues remain outstanding.</p>
<p>The Indonesian government asked Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick, the world's third largest gold company.  </p>
<p>The government advised Bre-X to keep keeping a 25 percent stake and Barrick to get 75 percent.</p>
<p>The request prompted Bre-X shareholders and Placer Dome to cry foul about the lack of an open bidding process.</p>
<p>But Barrick and Bre-X failed to reach an overall agreement by a December 4 deadline set by the Indonesian government.</p>
<p>That could leave the door open for other companies, Roland Horst, chief executive officer for Minorca Resources Inc said in an interview. Minorca has a seven percent interest in net profit from Busang production through an agreement with one of Bre-X's Indonesian partners.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think there's scope for other parties to become involved,&quot; Horst said, adding he is in daily contact with company associates in Indonesia.</p>
<p>&quot;If I were Placer, I'd still be talking to them (Bre-X).&quot;</p>
<p>Bre-X would not comment about the bidding process.</p>
<p>Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said Barrick was negotiating with Bre-X in good faith and the company's status had not changed since the government-imposed deadline passed earlier this week.</p>
<p>Barrick and Bre-X are talking about forming a joint-venture company to operate Busang, where Barrick would offer some combination of cash, special shares and funding of the development of the mine, Borg said.</p>
<p>But the future of the deal depends on Indonesian mining and government officials, who are out of the country until Monday, sources said.</p>
