<p>Despite the Toronto Stock Exchange's steep decline this week, analysts expect Canada's biggest equity market to resume its upward march and continue outperforming Wall Street in the New Year.</p>
<p>Early on Friday, Toronto's key 300 Composite Index posted its largest intraday drop in nine years, losing 171 points or almost three percent to 5670.</p>
<p>It was Toronto's biggest intraday fall since a 176.5 point slide on October 22, 1987, a few days after the Black Monday market crash of October 19, 1987.</p>
<p>The index has slid from a record of 6018 on November 28.</p>
<p>Toronto stocks recovered partly by Friday afternoon, when they were down 40.55 points to 5801.20.</p>
<p>Toronto's losses on Friday were sparked by comments late Thursday by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that were interpreted as suggesting that U.S. equity markets may be overvalued.</p>
<p>Profit-taking also hit Toronto stocks this week as investors cashed in on recent spectacular gains.</p>
<p>Montreal-based investment adviser Ron Meisels forecast more weakness in the next few weeks, before a return to strength.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Toronto will probably outperform New York in the first quarter of 1997,&quot; Meisels said.</p>
<p>Meisels said Toronto stocks traditionally outpace Wall Street in the late stages of a bull market as investors flock to Toronto's natural resource sector.</p>
<p>This year's boom has been fueled by U.S. economic growth and declining interest rates that prompted low returns on bonds and other fixed-income instruments, analysts said.</p>
<p>Toronto's key index has jumped almost 28 percent this year, versus a 23 percent gain by New York's Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p>
<p>Meisels said Toronto should also benefit later this year as Canadians make their annual contributions to tax-sheltered pension funds, many of which include mutual funds.</p>
<p>&quot;There's an enormous amount of mutual fund money being committed to the market,&quot; ScotiaMcLeod's director of investment research Jim Doak said.</p>
<p>In the near term, Toronto could extend this week's 4.3 percent decline, some analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we're looking at at least a (total) 10 percent correction,&quot; said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie.</p>
