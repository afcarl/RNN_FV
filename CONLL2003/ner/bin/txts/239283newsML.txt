From April 1, Canadian lumber exports which exceed quarterly or annual quotas are subject to export fees. Exports above 14.7 billion board feet annually or 4.226 billion board feet quarterly are subject to US$50 fee for every 1,000 board feet. If such excess exports exceed 650 million board feet, they are subject to a US$100 fee for every 1,000 board feet.

Export quotas are allocated for each province on a company-by-company basis. Shippers who have not been given an allocation are subject to the US$100 fee for any lumber they export.

This export data is based on Canadian export permits. There is a one-week lag between the entry of softwood lumber into the United States and the application for a Canadian permit.
