Canada agricultural exports up 5-11 percent in 1996 - Goodale.

WINNIPEG 1996-12-06

Canadian agricultural exports should exceed last year's record of C$17.5 billion by five to 11 percent as more processed food was shipped abroad, Canada's Agriculture Minister Ralph Goodale said.

"I don't yet have the final figures for the last quarter so just to be on the cautious side, I'm estimating a range that will probably be for the year at least five or six percent, maybe 10 or 11 percent," Goodale said.

Agriculture accounts for eight percent of Canada's gross domestic product and employs 1.9 million people, or 15 percent of the national labour force, he said.

"In the first nine months of (calendar) 1996 our export rate was nine percent ahead of the same point the previous year," Goodale told reporters after speaking to the Canadian Club of Winnipeg.

The rise in value of exports comes from higher prices and sales of processed livestock and oilseed despite a decline in prices for bulk commodities such as wheat, he said.

"There are some other countries which could potentially be bigger and better markets for canola oil but their tariff regimes discriminates against the value-added product," Goodale said.

Half of Canada's agricultural exports went to the United States in 1995 and Canada needs to wean itself from the U.S. and develop markets offshore, he said.

"One thing I want to be wary of is the need for greater diversification in our export markets, roughly half of that C$17.5 billion in 1995 went to the U.S.," he said.

One key to expanding to other export markets in processed foods is reducing and eliminating import tariffs, he said.

Japan's tariffs on canola oil are C$180 a tonne for crude oil and C$220 a tonne for refined oil, Canadian Oilseed Processors Association figures show.

Mexico has a seven percent tariff on crude oil and 14 percent on refined oil. China's canola oil tariff is 20 percent, South Korea's is 15 percent, India's is 22 percent and the European Union's is 9.4 percent, COPA figures show.

Asia-Pacific and Latin America show the most robust economic growth in the world and should be the focus of any such market development, he added.
