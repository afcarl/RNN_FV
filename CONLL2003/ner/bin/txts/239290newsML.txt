Canada's unemployment rate stays at 10 percent in November.

OTTAWA 1996-12-06

Canada's unemployment rate remained unchanged at 10.0 percent in November, the same as October, as the economy created almost no jobs, Statistics Canada said on Friday.

The government agency said only 7,000 new jobs were created in the month, bringing the number of employed Canadians to 13.73 million from 13.72 million in October.

Economists called the numbers disappointing, saying the stubbornly high unemployment rate suggested Canada's economy was still sluggish.

"I would say the report is definitely on the disappointing side. I would say it's even a little bit weaker than the sluggish headline number suggests, given that most of the growth was in part-time (work)," Doug Porter, senior economist at Nesbitt Burns said.

A Reuters survey of economists had forecast the unemployment rate to drop to 9.8 percent and employment to grow by 39,000 in November.

Part-time employment rose by 30,000 from the month before, but most of the gains were erased by declines in full-time employment.

Statistics Canada said employment had risen 35,000 since April, compared with 202,000 in the first four months of the year.

Employment in the service sector grew by 44,000 in November, the strongest monthly increase so far this year. But on a year-over-year basis, it rose only 0.7 percent, or 70,000.
