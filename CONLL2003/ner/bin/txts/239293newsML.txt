Canada says 700,000 refugees have now left Zaire.

OTTAWA 1996-12-06

More than 700,000 refugees have now returned to Rwanda from Zaire, Canadian Defense Minister Doug Young said on Friday.

"There has been a great deal of success because something like 700,000 refugees have been repatriated from Zaire to Rwanda, something never seen in history," he told Parliament.

Previous reports had spoken of 600,000 having gone back out of the original figure of more than one million who aid agencies said had fled to eastern Zaire in 1994 after a massacre of about a million people in Rwanda.

Nonetheless both he and Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy sought to give assurances that, though the need for airdrops and major military intervention would probably not be needed in eastern Zaire, the international mission still was on.

"Nobody indicated yesterday that we were ending our mission in Zaire," Young said. "Canada is not acting unilaterally. It will not leave this area unilaterally."

Canada is leading the multinational force designed to help refugees return to Rwanda and to allow aid agencies help refugees and displaced people in Zaire.

Axworthy said the coalition partners wanted to be able to respond when needed. He said, for example, that UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy told him on Friday there were lots of needy children among the displaced Zairians.

He said she advocated that rather than focusing on the numbers of refugees, "we should be focusing on what's within those numbers, and she said there's a lot of children that she believes still are in need of assistance."

Whether they need military help, he said, was being examined by the force commander, Canadian Lt. Gen. Maurice Baril, and the humanitarian agencies.

"They (the soldiers) will come home when the job is done. You want to make sure that it is done well," Axworthy told reporters.
