DBRS confirms St. Lawrence Cement rating.

TORONTO 1996-12-06

Dominion Bond Rating Service said on Friday it confirmed the rating on St. Lawrence Cement Inc's senior debt at BBB(high), with a stable trend.

DBRS said improving market conditions in Ontario and the United States have helped St. Lawrence to achieve higher earnings during the first nine months of 1996, although the performance in Quebec remained weak.

The bond rating service said productivity gains from St. Lawrence's recent restructuring efforts should support future earnings growth.

The company's balance sheet remains reasonable with seasonal factors accounting for the higher debt at the end of September 1996, DBRS said. It said operating cash flow is expected to improve in line with earnings growth and should help to strengthen the balance sheet through 1997.
