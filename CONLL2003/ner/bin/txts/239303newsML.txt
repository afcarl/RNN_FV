Arakis Energy Corp's long-awaited joint venture deal to develop its oil concessions in Sudan, valued at more than US$1 billion, will proceed without a U.S.-based oil company as a partner, the company revealed on Friday.

Arakis chief executive John McLeod told Reuters in an interview that political tension between Sudan and the United States was the main reason behind the potential U.S. partner, which was widely seen to be Occidental Petroleum Corp, being absent from the roster of international players.  

"In the end, politics won," McLeod said.

An executive order signed recently by U.S. President Bill Clinton to halt the granting of visas to Sudanese officials wanting to enter the United States came at a crucial time in the intense negotiations, he said.

"Pushed, walked, shoved, the government was not going to approve them as a consortium partner," he said.

Analysts have long said a U.S. partner would lend credibility to the Sudan deal, which had a long and controversial lead up to Friday's announcement.  

"We don't really have cash requirements for a significant period of time. The key thing here is that this consortium has the financial capacity to make this pipeline happen and they are committed to go ahead with the pipeline," McLeod said.

He said Arakis foresees cash flow from the project beginning in 1999. The pipeline's construction in the project, which will also include a ramped-up drilling program employing four rigs instead of the current two, was slated to start in early 1997. McLeod said costs of Khartoum's five-percent stake in the 150,000 barrel per day project would be carried by the other partners and repaid from its share of the oil.

"It would probably be considered a loan to them until they actually start getting cash flow," he said.

McLeod earlier this year said he was comfortable with a reserve estimate for the concession of 600 million barrels.

"When these fields are fully developed, I'm comfortable we've got 600 million there," he said. "The potential here, though, really is many times that," he said.

Arakis shares were near the top of Nasdaq's most-active list, falling 3/32 to 5-15/32 on volume 10.01 million shares. ((Reuters Calgary Bureau (403) 531-1624))
