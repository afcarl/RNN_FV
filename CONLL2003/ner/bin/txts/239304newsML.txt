Arakis forms Sudan consortium.

CALGARY 1996-12-06

Arakis Energy Corp said on Friday it has formed a consortium to proceed with an accelerated program of exploration and delineation of recent discoveries and development on Arakis' Sudan concession, together with immediate construction of an export pipeline.

Arakis said the consortium interests will be held 25 percent by Arakis through its wholly-owned subsidiary, State Petroleum Corp, 40 percent by the China National Petroleum Corp, 30 percent by Petronas Carigali, a subsidiary of the National Petroleum Co of Malaysia, and five percent by a company formed by the Sudan government.  

Arakis said the consortium will recognize both the audited capital contribution and the appraised value added to the concession by State. The company said it consequently does not expect to have further capital requirements in the Sudan for "a considerable period of time."

State will continue as operator of the US$1 billion Sudan project until formal agreements are signed, Arakis said.

It said operation of the project will likely be assumed by a joint operating company in which State will maintain a significant participating role.

The consortium plans to initially transport 150,000 barrels of oil per day to export markets by 1999.

McLeod said the Chinese partner "incorporated additional benefits to the Sudan government, which essentially got them their participation."

He also said that the U.S. firm was looking for a major role in the project, which it was not likely to negotiate successfully.

Under the deal, Arakis will get financial recognition for the money already spent developing the fields over the last two years, he said.

Its partners will have to make capital expenditures on the project until funds equal what Arakis has spent, he said. ((Reuters Toronto Bureau (416) 941-8100))
