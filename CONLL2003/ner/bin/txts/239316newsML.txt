RESEARCH ALERT - Comercial del Plata cut.

-- Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said on Friday it had cut its rating on Argentina's Sociedad Comercial del Plata SA to sell from hold.

-- Analyst Carlos de Leon said in a report he downgraded the stock because "substantial asset sales ... have continued to be absent," and debt will continue to grow with current investment plans.

-- The late opening of the Parque de la Costa theme park in April 1997 "means that the company will miss out on the peak summer season ... and is likely to report another loss during fiscal 1997," he said.
