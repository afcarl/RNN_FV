RESEARCH ALERT - Philip Morris raised.

-- Salomon Brothers analyst Diana K. Temple said she raised her rating on Philip Morris Cos Inc to trading buy from hold and raised her 1997 earnings per share estimate to $9.05 from $8.85.

-- "We are upgrading Philip Morris to a trading buy, believing the absence of litigation news (until the April 7 Wilner trial) in the face of a strong market and perception of low inflation will drive the stock higher," Temple said in a research note.  

-- She said that U.S. cigarette sales may rise by three percent to 229 billion, four billion better than expected due to strength in full priced brands like Marlboro, with a one percent gain for 1997.

-- "We project a 12 percent U.S. profit increase for 1996 (versus 10 percent previously) and 10 percent for 1997," temple said. "International profits are forecast to be up 20 percent in 1996 (on 11 percent volume growth to 652 billion) with 18 percent growth for 1997 (versus 15 percent projected)."

-- Shares were up 1-5/8 at 109-5/8.
