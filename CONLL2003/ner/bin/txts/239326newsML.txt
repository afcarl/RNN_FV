Founder proposes spin-off of Figgie unit.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

A group led by Harry Figgie Jr., founder of Figgie International Inc, has proposed that the company spin-off 80 percent of its Scott Aviation unit to shareholders, the group said in a regulatory filing.

The group, which has long been pressing Figgie International to reconsider its "deconglomeration" strategy, said the remaining 20 percent of Scott's stock should be sold to the public in an initial public offering.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said its financial adviser, Batchelder & Partners, presented the proposal to the Figgie board on December 4.  

In the presentation, the group also proposed that Figgie spin-off to shareholders, or divest Figgie's Interstate Electronics unit "as soon as feasible."

It also proposed that the company operate its Snorkel unit unless unless an attractive divestiture opportunity arises."

In making the proposals, the group said the Figgie board's continuing delay in taking steps to enhance shareholder value "is damaging to shareholders." It added that operating Figgie as a conglomerate is not likely to yield in the foreseeable future value to shareholders that equals the peak market price of the  company's common A shares achieved earlier this year.
