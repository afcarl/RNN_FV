White House opposes Intelsat Asian TV satellite.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

The White House said Friday that it opposed the acquisition of satellite television capacity in the Asia-Pacific region by international consortium Intelsat.

The Intelsat board of governors earlier Friday approved the procurement of a specialized satellite to provide direct- to-home television in the region, the White House National Economic Council said in a statement.

"The United States strongly opposes the proposed procurement by Intelsat of (the) satellite capacity," the statement said.

Private industry is fully capable of providing the services that the satellite would offer, it added.
