Tele-TV, partners say working on '97 plan.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Tele-TV, the interactive television venture belonging to Bell Atlantic Corp, NYNEX Corp and Pacific Telesis Group, said it and its partners are finalizing a 1997 business plan.

In a joint statement, the venture and its partners said they were discussing the most efficient way to manage the work.  

They also said Howard Stringer, the chairman and chief executive of Tele-TV, and Sandy Grushow, Tele-TV Media president, would continue under contract.

"Many important deliverables were produced in 1996, including key programming agreements and operating support systems that put Tele-TV in good position for delivering video packages to its customers, and more work remains for 1997," the companies said.

The statement comes in the wake of news reports that the venture would be shut down or folded into Bell Atlantic.

The companies were not immediately available to detail alternatives they may be considering for the entertainment programming venture meant to serve the video networks that the Bells planned to build.

Funding for Tele-TV was trimmed earlier this year from $480 million a year to $300 million, split evenly among the three partners.

PacTel said earlier Friday that Tele-TV would continue with its funding unchanged over three years.
