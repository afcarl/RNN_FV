<headline>Tele-TV, partners say working on '97 plan.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Tele-TV, the interactive television venture belonging to Bell Atlantic Corp, NYNEX Corp and Pacific Telesis Group, said it and its partners are finalizing a 1997 business plan.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the venture and its partners said they were discussing the most efficient way to manage the work.  </p>
<p>They also said Howard Stringer, the chairman and chief executive of Tele-TV, and Sandy Grushow, Tele-TV Media president, would continue under contract.</p>
<p>&quot;Many important deliverables were produced in 1996, including key programming agreements and operating support systems that put Tele-TV in good position for delivering video packages to its customers, and more work remains for 1997,&quot; the companies said.</p>
<p>The statement comes in the wake of news reports that the venture would be shut down or folded into Bell Atlantic.</p>
<p>The companies were not immediately available to detail alternatives they may be considering for the entertainment programming venture meant to serve the video networks that the Bells planned to build.</p>
<p>Funding for Tele-TV was trimmed earlier this year from $480 million a year to $300 million, split evenly among the three partners.</p>
<p>PacTel said earlier Friday that Tele-TV would continue with its funding unchanged over three years.</p>
