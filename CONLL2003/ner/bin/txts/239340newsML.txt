Florida offical scales back windstorm rate changes.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 1996-12-06

Florida's insurance commissioner said on Friday that the proposed windstorm insurance rate changes to reduce the rate burden in seven counties was scaled back.

Bill Nelson, Florida's insurance commissioner, said in a statement he cut by half rate rate changes that would have increased rates in 12 counties and cut rates in seven counties under a proposal from the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association.  

In a rate filing, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association sought higher increases for Dade, Broward and 10 other counties in a proposal to reduce premiums in seven north florida counties that historically have proved less likely to be hit by a hurricane, Nelson said.

Homeowners in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach will pay yearly windstorm premiums of $300 a year on a $150,000 home instead of $326 a year, Nelson said. The increase is about 9.5 percent instead of the proposed 19 percent, Nelson said.

Homeowners will be buying separate windstorm coverage for the first time in Palm Beach and Pasco Counties and their homeowners policies will be reduced to reflect this change, Nelson said.

The windstorm insurance pool was created in 1970 to provide coverage in hurricane-prone coastal areas where insurers were refusing to insure against windstorm losses, Nelson said.
