<headline>Florida offical scales back windstorm rate changes.</headline>

<p>Florida's insurance commissioner said on Friday that the proposed windstorm insurance rate changes to reduce the rate burden in seven counties was scaled back.</p>
<p>Bill Nelson, Florida's insurance commissioner, said in a statement he cut by half rate rate changes that would have increased rates in 12 counties and cut rates in seven counties under a proposal from the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association.  </p>
<p>In a rate filing, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association sought higher increases for Dade, Broward and 10 other counties in a proposal to reduce premiums in seven north florida counties that historically have proved less likely to be hit by a hurricane, Nelson said.</p>
<p>Homeowners in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach will pay yearly windstorm premiums of $300 a year on a $150,000 home instead of $326 a year, Nelson said. The increase is about 9.5 percent instead of the proposed 19 percent, Nelson said.</p>
<p>Homeowners will be buying separate windstorm coverage for the first time in Palm Beach and Pasco Counties and their homeowners policies will be reduced to reflect this change, Nelson said.</p>
<p>The windstorm insurance pool was created in 1970 to provide coverage in hurricane-prone coastal areas where insurers were refusing to insure against windstorm losses, Nelson said.</p>
