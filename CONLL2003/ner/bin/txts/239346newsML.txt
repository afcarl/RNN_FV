Signal Apparel replaces president.

CHATTANOOGA, TENN. 1996-12-06

Signal Apparel Co said on Friday that it replaced its president as part of a restructuring that would involve the sale of its Heritage sportswear business.

The apparel company said in a statement it was phasing out its non-core operations to concentrate on its traditional strengths, which include license agreements with sports personalities.

The company said Barton Bresky, formerly the president of its Signal Artwear unit, replaced Bruce Krebbs as president. Bresky will also assume the title of chief executive.

The company said it would assess the viability of its LaGrange, Georgia, and Tazewell, Tennessee, plants, as part of the restructuring.

Officials from the company were not immediately available for further comment.
