US Treasuries trim sharp losses to end mildly off.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

U.S. Treasuries fell modestly on Friday, recovering from sharp early losses spurred by bearish remarks from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.

A weaker-than-expected November employment report allowed for the dramatic rebound, traders said.

The 30-year bond closed at 99-27/32, down 2/32 from Thursday, but above the 1-1/2 point drop seen at the day's open. Its yield held steady at 6.51 percent.

Early in the session, the long bond's yield had risen to 6.61 percent -- a far cry from Wednesday's 6.40 percent.  

Traders said activity was highly volatile, as Treasuries see-sawed throughout the day.

One trader at a large primary dealership said he expects the volatility to continue. "Part of it is being contributed by the year-end as people take profits," he said. "But the fundamental news hasn't changed materially. So, we should trade in a wide range, but a choppy range."

But it is not likely the long bond will trade much below 6.50 in the near future, traders said.  

"Trading is going to be more range-bound in (the rest of) December," said Brett Benza, senior trader at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. "It will be more two-way, rather than just grinding up like in November."

Benza added that Friday's action could mean the end of the recent buy-on-dips scenario. "People seemed more comfortable selling on strength than they had been in a month," he said.

That was evidenced Friday when every time the market tried to rally, it was met by selling. Traders said that U.S. retail accounts did most of the buying, but selling by foreign accounts outpaced the buying.  

And the selling was heavy and started early, primarily due to Greenspan's remarks made Thursday night in Washington.

Greenspan said that while inflation has been low, its "future course remains uncertain." Traders said that took all talk of a near-term easing out of the market.

Greenspan also shocked stock markets worldwide when he suggested that asset prices are too high. He said the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock prices, because it could do damage to the economy.  

But despite being down almost 1-1/2 points at the New York open, bonds staged a furious comeback Friday morning as nonfarm payrolls rose just 118,000 in November, well below the 179,000 Reuters consensus, and below the market's worst fears of a ris well above 200,000. The market also liked the increase in the unemployment rate to 5.4 percent from October's 5.2 percent.

Yet, the average workweek rose and average hourly earnings soared, tempering the market's enthsiasm.

"There was something in the report for everybody," said a trader.  

The market edged higher through the morning, erasing all of the day's losses at one point, before the selling knocked prices back down another 3/8 of a point. But by the end of the day most of the damage had been erased.

Benza said all the selling overseas was too much of a negative psychlogocal factor to overcome completely.

"Moves like last night you can't survive unless you have a strong level of positions," added another trader.

He said that Friday's move may have been the wakeup call the complacent bond market needed.  

He said much of the "bad longs have been rinsed" and the market "is technically better."

The lone area that prospered Friday were bills, as investors fled global stock and bond markets for short Treasuries. The three-month bill was down two basis points at 4.90 percent, although it had traded to 4.86 -- its lowest level since April.

Both the six-month and one-year bills were down one basis point each to 5.02 percent and 5.16 percent, respectively.
