ST. LOUIS 1996-12-06

Trans World Airlines Inc said Friday its load factor fell to 58.8 percent in November from 63.7 percent a year ago.

This year's number was hurt because the Sunday after Thanksgiving, usually the heaviest travel day of the year, came in December, TWA said.  

Available seat miles were 3.12 billion, up from 2.97 billion a year ago, while revenue passenger miles were 1.84 billion, down from 1.90 billion a year ago.

For the year through November, load factor was 66.9 percent, up from 66.0 percent a year ago.

Available seat miles were 37.33 billion, up from 34.80 billion, while revenue passenger miles rose to 24.96 billion from 22.97 billion, TWA said.
