Web access planned for securities fraud cases.

PALO ALTO, Calif. 1996-12-06

The Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday it was joining Stanford Law School and federal judges in northern California in a bid to provide public access to securities lawsuits via the Internet.

As part of the effort, Stanford Law School said it created a site on the Internet's World Wide Web that could serve as a clearinghouse for information on securities fraud cases. The site was to be unveiled at a San Francisco news conference on Friday.

Institutional investors with more than $1 trillion in assets under management have already registered for automatic updates of the Stanford Law School site.

The move follows the defeat last month of Proposition 211, a California ballot issue that would have made it easier to file class-action securities lawsuits in the state.

"We would have done this without regard to 211," said Stanford Law School Professor Joseph Grundfest, adding that a new rule would be adopted to foster electronic filing.

The SEC said judges of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California have proposed a rule that would require attorneys in securities fraud cases to post major litigation documents on the Internet.

The proposed rule would not oblige attorneys to post the documents on any particular site, however, and the SEC said it would provide on its home page a list of qualified Internet sites for such data, of which Stanford would be the first.

This would be similar to the way in which publicly traded corporations disclose financial information through the SEC's Edgar site, which was started as a university project.

SEC Commissioner Steve Wallman said in a statement that, like the electronic access to financial disclosures, investors "will now start to have the same access to information about federal securities fraud class action litigation."

Thelton Henderson, chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, said the court was seeking comments from attorneys and others on the proposal.

The Northern District of California is home to Silicon Valley, and the venue for more class action securities fraud litigation than any other federal court in the nation.

Henderson said securities class-action lawsuits often require communication with thousands of people.

"In a world of paper-based correspondence that process is often slow and expensive," Henderson said. "The Internet may help alleviate this problem by creating a cheap and efficient means of providing class members in securities cases with detailed and timely information about litigation."
