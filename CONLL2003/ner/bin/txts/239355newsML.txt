US stock index futures end down, but mood lightens.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

U.S. stock index futures ended lower, but the negative mood lightened as most contracts managed to trade substantially above the day's lows, traders and analysts said.

"You have to perceive the break as constructive," one Standard & Poor's 500 futures trader said.

Many traders revised their gloomy forecasts for continued declines as Decmeber S&P 500s briefly turned higher in the afternoon. By that time, the trading frenzy in the pits calmed down. S&P 500 futures traded in fast-market conditions for most of the morning, market sources said.  

Traders said December S&Ps fell nearly 20 points in a kneejerk reaction to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments that the U.S. central bank should consider U.S. asset prices when setting monetary policy.

Greenspan spoke again on Friday afternoon, but declined to comment on the stock market's reaction to his comments.

Greenspan did say there was a limit to how long the U.S. can depend on foreign capital to fund growth, and said he sees great market tension if Social Security funds are put into stocks.  

After his latest comments, December S&Ps dipped below the key technical area of 737.00.

"Greenspan's comments were totally inappropriate," one floor trader said. "I think we will recover nicely from them."

"This is all perceived as an opportunity to rebase," another trader said. "We have quarter-end and year-end buying ahead of us."

In addition, the market is entering into a strong seasonal period.

However, some technical analysts believe more declines are imminent before the market can consolidate and continue higher.  

There are also concerns that mutual fund managers may nail down profits into the last trading day of the December contract on Thursday, December 19.

One major U.S. firm sold about 6,000 December S&P contracts throughout the day. The firm reportedly sold the contracts, even while December was bouncing higher.

Arbitrage sell and buy programs were noted throughout the day, underscoring the volatility of the market, traders said. Buy programs came in at about 2.20 points over cash, while sell programs were touched off when December's premium to cash narrowed to about 0.50.  

Fair value was quoted by several floor traders at 1.00 to 1.25 points over cash.

At the end of pit trade, December S&Ps were off 4.85 at 740.50, New Composites were off 2.35 at 390.85, Value Lines fell 4.50 to 679.25, Nikkeis were 405 lower at 20,495, Midcaps were down 2.35 at 253.85 and Nasdaqs were 9.00 lower at 830.25.
