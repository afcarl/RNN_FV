CHICAGO 1996-12-06

UAL Corp's United Airlines said Friday its total passenger load factor in November fell to 66.4 percent from 68.6 percent a year ago.  

Available seat miles rose to 13.23 billion in November from 12.66 billion a year ago. Revenue passenger miles were 8.78 billion, up from 8.68 billion a year ago.

"Domestically, our November domestic traffic was negatively impacted this year because of the late date of Thanksgiving," president and chief operating officer John Edwardson said in a statement.

He added that the late Thanksgiving date should boost traffic in December. "Thanksgiving traffic for the period, however, was strong," he said. "United set a single-day boarding record on Sunday, December 1, carrying 282,024 passengers."

For the year through November, load factor was 71.9 percent, up from 70.8 percent a year ago.

Available seat miles were 148.90 billion, up from 144.96 billion a year ago. Revenue passenger miles were 107.06 billion, up from 102.58 billion a year ago, the airline said.

UAL shares fell 2-1/8 Friday to 57-7/8.
