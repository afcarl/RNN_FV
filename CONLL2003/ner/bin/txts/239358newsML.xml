<headline>Dlr recovers to end wild US session sharply higher.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Cheered by a dramatic recovery in U.S. stock and bond markets, the dollar rebounded from a sharp overseas slide to end a topsy-turvy session significantly higher against other major currencies on Friday.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to lows of 1.5280 marks and 111.73 yen in European trade after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan spooked investors by warning against &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in booming U.S. asset markets in a speech late Thursday.</p>
<p>The greenback began U.S. trade near these lows, but by the end of the day, the dollar had recovered to 1.5460/70 marks, sharply higher than its opening level of 1.5305/10.  </p>
<p>And against the yen, the dollar ended at 112.85/95, up from 112.15/25.</p>
<p>The U.S. central bank chief's remarks sparked fears that the U.S. stock market bubble could soon burst and sent foreign stock markets reeling in sympathy. In anticipation of a similar meltdown once trading began in the U.S., the dollar slid sharply overnight.</p>
<p>As expected, both bonds and stocks stumbled badly in early U.S. dealings, with the 30-year Treasury bond falling close to a point-and-a-half and the Dow Jones Industrials shedding over 140 points.  </p>
<p>&quot;Initially the dollar definitely followed the meltdown in stocks and bonds,&quot; said Doug Lee, assistant vice president and corporate dealer at Sakura Bank Ltd. &quot;The timing of the Greenspan remarks was key because the markets had run up so high in the last week and people saw an opportunity to take profits.&quot;</p>
<p>But weak U.S. employment data proved to be a savior for bonds, which in turn helped stocks erase a good deal of their early losses and sparked gains in the dollar.  </p>
<p>The U.S. Labor Department reported that non-farm payrolls expanded by 118,000 in November, a far weaker advance than most Wall Street economists had anticipated. The report also showed that the unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent in November from 5.2 percent in the prior month, allowing bonds to rebound to near flat on the day.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond closed down 2/32 at 99-27/32 to yield 6.51 percent. The Dow Jones Industrials ended the day down 55 points at around 6,382.  </p>
<p>&quot;The payrolls report helped to stabilize the bonds and that helped to stabilize the dollar,&quot; said Mike Malpede, senior foreign exchange analyst at Refco Group Ltd in Chicago.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on Friday, the resignation of a British Conservative parliament member wiped out the one seat majority of Prime Minister John Major's government, hurting the British pound in late-morning trade.</p>
<p>But sterling recovered some of its luster in the afternoon, ending the day slightly higher at $1.6470/80, up from $1.6460/70 at the open.  </p>
<p>In other trade, the dollar rose sharply to 1.3150/60 Swiss francs from 1.2945/55 at the open. It ended the day lower at Canadian $1.3588/93 against C$1.3630/35.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar finished at $0.7968/73, little changed from $0.7965/70 at the open.</p>
