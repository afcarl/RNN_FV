ConEd to shut 1,000 MW NY power unit today.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Consolidated Edison Co of New York (ConEd) Friday said it will shut a 1,000 megawatt (MW) unit at its Ravenswood generating complex later today for scheduled maintenance.

The unit in Long Island City, N.Y., was planned to resume operation December 16 following the "winter firm-up outage," said a company spokesman.

The Ravenswood's unit 1 remained shut for an extensive maintenance program until next year, and unit 2 stayed in reserve shutdown, he said.  Units 1 and 2 have combined capacity of 742 MW.

ConEd is the operator and sole owner of the Ravenwood units, which use fuel oil and/or natural gas to generate electricity.
