<title>USA: NYMEX electric futures plunge in line with natgas.</title>
<headline>NYMEX electric futures plunge in line with natgas.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>NYMEX electricity futures ended sharply lower Friday, plunging in tandem with similar tumbles in physical power and natural gas prices.</p>
<p>&quot;It took a pretty good hit today,&quot; a New York broker said.</p>
<p>The electricity contracts crashed along with the natural gas market just as they surged to new highs with it earlier this week, brokers and traders said.</p>
<p>The power contracts managed to trim their losses midday. Then, the recovery fizzled when a avalanche of late selling in the gas market spilled into the electricity complex.</p>
<p>Gas prices, which leaped on storage concerns and forecasts of cold weather in eastern U.S., were overtaken by profit-taking and revised weather outlook that called for above-normal temperatures in the eastern half of the country.</p>
<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures settled down 29.7 cents at $3.487 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>January natural gas delivered to the San Juan/Blanco Hub finished near $3.35, down from Thursday's $3.45.</p>
<p>In late over-the-counter (OTC) business, January 1997 California-Oregon Border deliveries were talked near $25.75 a megawatt hour (MWh) and January Palo Verde (PV) near $26.50.</p>
<p>January COB futures settled down $3.01 or 10.4 percent at $25.79, just off its session low of $25.75.</p>
<p>February COB finished down $2.58 at $19.80 after traded between $21.85-$19.50. Deferred COB months ended 55 cents to 1.25 lower.</p>
<p>January PV futures settled down $2.93 or 10.1 percent at $26.00, its session low.</p>
<p>February finished down $3.15 at $19.75. Outer PV contracts mostly ended 50 cents to $2.50 lower.</p>
<p>Natural gas, which some traders and analysts expected to decline next week, would continue to lead western electricity prices, market sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Gas will be driving them lower,&quot; the broker said.</p>
<p>A Houston marketer predicted January COB and PV would hit the low $20.00s if gas prices were to extend today's dive.</p>
<p>The latest forecast showed another storm system could push into the Pacific Northwest next week, and bring snow from Washington State east to Montana. Rainfall would be heavy, as would snowfall over northern Rockies.</p>
<p>During the same period, temperatures in the Northwest and Southwest would average normal to above-normal.</p>
<p>NYMEX estimated 517 COB and 200 PV contracts were sold.</p>
