<p>Next year's Atlantic hurricane season should be slower than this year's, but a noted forecaster said Friday it would be busier than usual and could be the beginning of a cycle of increased hurricane activity.</p>
<p>Prof. William Gray of Colorado State University, whose research team has won an international reputation for storm prognostication, said another busy year in 1997 could mean the Atlantic hurricane zone -- the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico -- was entering a new, active cycle.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears that we have left the period of lessened hurricane activity and it is possible we could be seeing a basic change in the long-term global circulation patterns,&quot; he said. &quot;This change could result in increased hurricane activity.&quot;</p>
<p>For the 1997 June through November season, Gray and his team Friday predicted 11 tropical storms, of which seven would intensify into hurricanes and three would become killer storms. Gray does not predict where hurricanes will make landfall.</p>
<p>In an &quot;average&quot; season there are 9.3 tropical storms, of which 5.8 become hurricanes -- with maximum sustained winds of 74 mph (119 kph) or higher -- and 2.1 intense hurricanes of Category 3 or higher.</p>
<p>Category 3 storms, with maximum sustained winds of 111 mph (179 kph) or higher, cause 75 percent of all hurricane-spawned damage. But heavy rains of a storm with relatively weak winds, like Hurricane Hortense that doused Puerto Rico this year, can cost many lives and millions in damage.</p>
<p>Hortense claimed at least 22 lives in September when it drenched Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Earlier that month, Hurricane Fran was the costliest storm to hit the mainland United States during the 1996 season, causing widespread flooding after coming ashore in North Carolina in September, claiming at least 34 U.S. lives and chalking up an estimated $1.6 billion in insured property damages.</p>
<p>Even an average 1997 year would make 1995-1997 the busiest three years of hurricane activity ever.</p>
<p>There were 32 named storms in 1995 and 1996 combined. The 19 storms in 1995 made that near-record year the busiest in six decades. Of the 13 tropical storms in the 1996 season that ended last week, nine became hurricanes and six of those reached Category 3 or higher.</p>
<p>Gray, who has been issuing hurricane-season predictions for 14 years, bases his forecasts on a complicated analysis of world weather patterns, including ocean temperature and surface pressure, wind patterns and rainfall, as well as analysis of past years' storm activity.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the globe as one interconnected unit, there are surprising forecasting signals that allow you with some skill to predict what will occur months in advance,&quot; Gray said.</p>
<p>In August, Gray and his team had predicted that 11 tropical storms would form and evolve into seven hurricanes and three intense hurricanes. But fewer actually formed. He said Friday that his missing the mark for 1996 could be an indication that there will be an upswing in activity for the next 25 years or so.</p>
