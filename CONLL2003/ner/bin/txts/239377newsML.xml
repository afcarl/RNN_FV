<headline>EMERGENCY WEATHER CONDITIONS -  WSC - 06-DEC					     .</headline>
<text>
<p>Tropical Cyclone 08B continues to dissipate as it heads towards the southeast coast of India. Landfall is expected near Madras in less than 12 hours. Top winds near landfall should be less than 50 mph. Locally heavy rains may still lead to flooding along the coastal plain but we do not expect this to be a major problem. Shipping near the coast is still at risk until the system moves inland. It should weaken rapidly after making landfall.  </p>
<p>Tropical Cyclone Daniella is a major threat to shipping in the South Indian Ocean. It is centered near 15s/55e, moving west southwest at 6 mph. Top winds are near 130 mph and will remain steady or weaken slightly during the next 24 hours. Winds diminish to about 100 mph in 48 hours as the system continues to track towards east-central Madagascar. The system may threaten eastern Madagascar in about 72 hours.  </p>
<p>THERE ARE NO FURTHER EMERGENCY STATEMENTS AT THIS TIME</p>
