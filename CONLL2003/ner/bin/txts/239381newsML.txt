Cole Taylor bank spinoff delayed.

WHEELING, Ill. 1996-12-06

Cole Taylor Financial Group Inc said Friday the proposed spinoff of its Cole Taylor Bank unit is now targeted for January rather than the end of the year.

Cole Taylor president Bruce Taylor said due to year-end schedules, it did not appear feasible that the deal would be completed by the end of the year.  

Cole Taylor said earlier this year it would spin the bank off to a group of shareholders headed by the Taylor family.

The remaining company would be renamed Reliance Acceptance Corp, which will be publicly traded and focus on auto financing.

Cole Taylor shares were down 1/4 at 27-3/4 Friday.
