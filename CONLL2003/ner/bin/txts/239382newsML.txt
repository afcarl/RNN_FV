Possis terminates Bard distribution deal.

MINNEAPOLIS 1996-12-06

Possis Medical Inc said Friday it sent a notice terminating its supply and distribution agreement with C.R. Bard Inc for the Possis Perma-Seal Dialysis Access Graft.

Possis said it is in negotiations with Bard concerning settlement and the terms of separation. Possis said Bard breached the agreement and has 30 days to correct it.

On August 5, Possis said Bard purchased IMPRA Inc, a supplier of synthetic vascular grafts and vascular access grafts for kidney dialysis patients.

"The impact of Bard's purchase of IMPRA Inc, a direct competitor for sales of the Perma-Seal Graft, and placing IMPRA in control of marketing the Perma-Seal Graft, made it impossible for Possis to keep Bard/IMPRA as its distributor," Possis said in a statment.

The agreement, signed on December 30, 1994, granted Bard worldwide rights to sell Perma-Seal Grafts manufactured by Possis, the company said.
