<p>Mild temperatures forecast for much of the U.S. next week were likely to keep natural gas prices on the defensive near-term, but most saw only limited downside with storage low and winter still ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of concern over the weather forecasts, but there's enough support in the market to keep things fairly stable. I don't think anyone wants to sell it too aggressively right now,&quot; a Texas trader said.</p>
<p>After a soft opening this week, colder Midwest weather and a bullish American Gas Association (AGA) stock report helped drive spot futures up 16 percent before profit taking Friday took some of the steam out of the rally.</p>
<p>On the New York Mercantile Exchange Friday, January Henry Hub natgas futures tumbled 29.7 cents to close at $3.487 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). The contract hit a new high Thursday of $3.80.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service 6-10 day forecast released Friday said more than half the nation will experience above-normal temperatures during the Dec 12-16 period.</p>
<p>While prospects for milder weather in the Midwest early next week forced some utilities to turn back gas, few expected prices to buckle this early in the heating season.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we're in for a little weakness next week. Everyone knows there's no (extreme) weather, but if it does show up, the sky could be the limit again,&quot; said one Houston-based risk manager.</p>
<p>A Midwest trader agreed. &quot;We could be on the defensive next week, but below $3.40 (basis January NYMEX), I think you'll see some scale down buying.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said funds rolling length out of January next week to beat higher, pre-expiry margins also could translate into lower up front prices near-term. The spot month expires Dec 24.</p>
<p>But most traders agreed concerns about low U.S. gas inventories, fueled by Wednesday's storage report which showed an unexpectedly-large 104 billion cubic feet (bcf) decline, should be enough to temper any slide. U.S. gas inventories at 77 percent of capacity were 217 bcf, or eight percent, below last year's relatively low levels.</p>
<p>&quot;With normal weather in December, we could go into January with storage 15 to 20 percent below-normal,&quot; said Chris Eades, gas analyst at UBS Securities in New York, adding he expected formidable support at Henry Hub this month in the $3.25 area.</p>
<p>While drawdowns this month will not likely match last December's weekly average of 142 bcf, traders said an uncertain winter also should be enough to keep the bears at bay, at least until the year-on-year gap was trimmed.</p>
<p>And though Eastern stocks, still at 86 percent full and slightly above last year, appeared in relatively good shape, traders noted western and producing region inventories at about 65 percent of capacity continued to significantly lag year-ago levels.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, weather will remain the key to direction and varied forecasts promise little certainty and a lot more volatility.</p>
