First Comm'l OKs 1-for-125 reverse split.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. 1996-12-06

First Commercial Bancorp Inc said Friday that its shareholders approved a one-for-125 reverse stock split.

"The company's low per share stock price would have failed to comply with the proposed new rules for trading on the NASDAQ SmallCap Market," First Commercial said in a release.

"The board of directors believes that the reverse stock split will increase the per share market price of the company's common stock, thereby allowing it to satisfy those requirements."  

First Commercial shares closed Friday at 3/32.

The company said it filed an amendment to its certificate of incorporation that becomes effective today, and as a result, each share of its common stock will be converted into 1/125th of a share.

First Commercial said it will not issue fractional shares, but will exchange them for cash.

The reverse split became effective 1700 EST Friday, the company said.
