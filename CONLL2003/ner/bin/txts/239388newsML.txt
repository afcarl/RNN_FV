Exogen adopts shareholder rights plan.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Exogen Inc. said it adopted a shareholder rights plan -- commonly known as a poison pill -- to guard against a hostile takeover bid for the company.

The plan allows the company to distribute one preferred stock purchases right for each outstanding share of the company's common stock owned at an exercise price of $30 per right.

The company said it will distribute the rights to holders of its common stock of record on December 19, 1996, as a dividend. The rights will expire, unless earlier redeemed, on December 19, 2006, the company added.
