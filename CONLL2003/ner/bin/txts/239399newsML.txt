U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Arakis news seen as non-event.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

Trading in shares and options of Canadian oil company Arakis Energy Corp got a jolt Friday as the company finally outlined details of its joint venture deal to develop its oil concessions in Sudan.

But options traders said the news had largely been anticipated.

"It was the world's worst-kept secret," said a trader at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. "It looks like really a non-event."

But that didn't slow the heavy trading in Arakis options seen over the last couple of weeks.  

By late trade, the Arakis January 5 call had traded roughly 8,850 contracts on the CBOE, making it the most heavily traded equity option around.

Combined with 2,220 contracts traded on the American Stock Exchange, the January 5 calls traded more than 11,000 contracts.

The April 5 call traded around 3,600 contracts on both exchanges.

The company's stock traded in the U.S. was down 5/16 at 5-1/4 in late trading on heavy volume of about 11.6 million shares.  

The company said it formed a consortium to proceed with an accelerated program of exploration and development for its 12.2 million acre oil concession in Sudan and construction of a 950 mile pipeline.

It said the deal is worth more than $1 billion.

The company's share of the consortium is 25 percent, less than some had expected, options traders said.

The trader at the CBOE said volatilities in the Arakis options declined sharply after the news.

Traders said volatilities had gotten pumped up in anticipation of news on the oil deal.  

Another high-volume situation was seen in Bankers Trust New York Corp options, where the December 80 call traded about 2,600 contracts and the January 80 call traded about 2,760 contracts.

Michael Schwartz at Oppenheimer & Co said the activity could be investors rolling a position out to January.

In other activity, several options on General Instrument Corp were active.

The General Instrument December 20 call traded more than 1,500 contracts, the December 22-1/2 call traded 1,400 and the December 25 traded 1,650. The January 25 call traded 2,530.  

None of the General Instrument volume crossed as spreads and Schwartz said it could be a large order from an investor using options to facilitate a stock position.

General Instrument shares rose two to 24-1/4 on consolidated volume of 3.5 million shares.

Elsewhere, the Bombay Co Inc March 5 call traded about 7,430 contracts. The stock was unchanged at five.
