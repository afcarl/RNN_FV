<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Arakis news seen as non-event.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Trading in shares and options of Canadian oil company Arakis Energy Corp got a jolt Friday as the company finally outlined details of its joint venture deal to develop its oil concessions in Sudan.</p>
<p>But options traders said the news had largely been anticipated.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the world's worst-kept secret,&quot; said a trader at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. &quot;It looks like really a non-event.&quot;</p>
<p>But that didn't slow the heavy trading in Arakis options seen over the last couple of weeks.  </p>
<p>By late trade, the Arakis January 5 call had traded roughly 8,850 contracts on the CBOE, making it the most heavily traded equity option around.</p>
<p>Combined with 2,220 contracts traded on the American Stock Exchange, the January 5 calls traded more than 11,000 contracts.</p>
<p>The April 5 call traded around 3,600 contracts on both exchanges.</p>
<p>The company's stock traded in the U.S. was down 5/16 at 5-1/4 in late trading on heavy volume of about 11.6 million shares.  </p>
<p>The company said it formed a consortium to proceed with an accelerated program of exploration and development for its 12.2 million acre oil concession in Sudan and construction of a 950 mile pipeline.</p>
<p>It said the deal is worth more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>The company's share of the consortium is 25 percent, less than some had expected, options traders said.</p>
<p>The trader at the CBOE said volatilities in the Arakis options declined sharply after the news.</p>
<p>Traders said volatilities had gotten pumped up in anticipation of news on the oil deal.  </p>
<p>Another high-volume situation was seen in Bankers Trust New York Corp options, where the December 80 call traded about 2,600 contracts and the January 80 call traded about 2,760 contracts.</p>
<p>Michael Schwartz at Oppenheimer &amp; Co said the activity could be investors rolling a position out to January.</p>
<p>In other activity, several options on General Instrument Corp were active.</p>
<p>The General Instrument December 20 call traded more than 1,500 contracts, the December 22-1/2 call traded 1,400 and the December 25 traded 1,650. The January 25 call traded 2,530.  </p>
<p>None of the General Instrument volume crossed as spreads and Schwartz said it could be a large order from an investor using options to facilitate a stock position.</p>
<p>General Instrument shares rose two to 24-1/4 on consolidated volume of 3.5 million shares.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Bombay Co Inc March 5 call traded about 7,430 contracts. The stock was unchanged at five.</p>
