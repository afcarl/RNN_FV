Americas Growth Fund sued by investors.

MIAMI 1996-12-06

The Americas Growth Fund Inc said on Friday an investor group that says it owns 10 percent of the company filed a shareholders' lawsuit.

The suit alleges breach of fiduciary duty by the company for ending a proposed merger with Advanced Electronic Support Products Inc on November 8.

The group consists of Kevin King, Herbert Hill -- as general partner of Double H Investment Co and Bargelt Investments -- Bonnie Hayes and Ronald Hayes. It seeks unspecified damages.

The company said it did not know whether the group owned 10 percent of Americas Growth Fund stock.

Americas Growth Fund said it would fight the suit.
