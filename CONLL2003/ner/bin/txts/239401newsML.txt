U.S. March T-bonds end down but up from day's lows.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

U.S. debt futures ended slightly lower and off the day's lows in a recovery from fallout from comments Thursday by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan.

In a speech in Washington Thursday night, Greenspan said the Fed must be wary of "irrational exuberance" in U.S. stocks and other asset markets. Greenspan's comments revived fears about the outlook for 1997 inflation and interest rates and sent reverberations through world markets.

March T-bond futures callapsed to 112-8/32 overnight on the news, but recovered in day trade on November jobs data.  

Weaker than expected jobs growth in November took the market's mind off the Greenspan panic-selling and allowed debt futures to rally off their lows. November payrolls rose 118,000, below the 179,000 forecast and the revised 224,000 in October.

Trading was extremely heavy. Chicago Board of Trade bond futures volume was estimated at 750,000 contracts, just shy of the 760,885 record set on February 17, 1994, an exchange source said.

Thursday's volume was the tenth-heaviest on record, with 683,533 contracts traded, the CBOT source said.  

Some traders said the sell-off Thursday and early Friday was a much-needed correction of the rally to 9-1/2 month highs. They said the medium and long term bullish trends were intact, with the market set to consolidate in December.

"I think we'll be choppy through the rest of this month," agreed Michael Boss, futures analyst with Aubrey G. Lanston.

"Overall it's healthy for the market," he added. "For seven weeks we had almost no pullbacks."

"There's profit-taking but not panic," Boss added. "Overall I think (Greenspan) is probably pretty pleased with the way this worked out."  

Others said the market was putting in a near-term top and could be headed for a retest of the 112-00 downside target many technicians had set for a correction.

"We've put in a top, people are taking profits for year-end, foreigners are selling the market and we didn't get a coupon pass," another T-bond trader said. He said bearishness from Greenspan's comments would likely linger into next week, even though the market recovered well Friday.

"He had something to say and he said it," the trader added. "He doesn't want equity or bond prices up here."  

At settlement, March T-bonds were down 8/32 at 113-27/32, 10-year notes fell 8/32 to 110-6/32, five-year notes were down 13/64 at 107-22/64, March T-bills ended flat at 95.01 and March Eurodollars were down one at 94.47.
