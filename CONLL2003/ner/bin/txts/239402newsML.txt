Nasdaq ends down but off lows.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Nasdaq stocks closed on the downside on Friday, but managed to rise off their early morning lows due to some recovery in bonds and scattered strength in some high technology issues.

The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 12.44 points, or 0.86 percent, at 1287 at its unofficial close, while declines led advancing issues by 2988 to 1516 on volume of about 657 million shares.

Analysts said tech stocks declined amid growing concerns that profits do not justify their high valuations.  

The overall retreat in the stock market was in response to cautionary comments on the inflation and the markets late on Thursday by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, which sparked interest rate fears.

Saving Nasdaq from a total drubbing was a rally in shares of Dell Computer Corp, which reversed its earlier drop and ended up 2-1/4 at 113-1/2. SoundView initiated coverage of Dell with a short-term hold and a long-term buy.

Informix Corp also did better, closing up 1-3/8 at 25-1/8. Oppenheimer & Co raised its rating on Informix to buy from market performer.
