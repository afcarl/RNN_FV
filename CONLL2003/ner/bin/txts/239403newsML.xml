<p>IMM currency futures ended pit trading mixed on Friday as morning excitement over remarks by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan subsided and the dollar and stock and bond markets recovered on U.S. payrolls data.</p>
<p>Traders said bonds and stocks over-reacted to Greenspan's comment Thursday night that the Fed needs to beware of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in asset markets. Currency futures did not follow bonds and stocks over the falls, trading in fairly narrow ranges on the session.</p>
<p>&quot;The currencies were a little more rational than the other markets throughout the day,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>The dollar and European stocks fell overnight on the Fed chief's remarks, and U.S. bonds and stocks followed suit.</p>
<p>Greenspan's impact was blunted by mid-morning, however, by payrolls data that markets viewed as inflationary, but only mildly so and not enough to convince the Fed to raise interest rates at its December 17 policy-making meeting.</p>
<p>One currency futures analyst dissented, saying he still looks for a quarter-point rate hike before Christmas, but said that the payroll data argued against such a possibility.</p>
<p>Traders eagerly awaited additional remarks from Greenspan at a luncheon in Philadelphia on Friday, but were let down.  </p>
<p>The Fed chief said nothing of immediate consequence for the markets and refused to answer questions afterward.</p>
<p>November U.S. non-farm payrolls rose 118,000, less than the 179,000 forecast and lower than a revised October figure of 224,000, it was reported Friday. November average hourly earnings were up 0.8 percent and the average work week was 34.5 hours, both above analysts' forecasts, the government said.</p>
<p>December yen fell on Friday to finish just above the intraday low of $0.008859. December Swiss francs opened higher, then reversed to end near their pivot point. Both reflected an intact long-term dollar uptrend, traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;I'm looking for the dollar to get back in its range. It really never came out,&quot; one trader said. &quot;The dollar's back really comfortably.&quot;</p>
<p>December marks opened strongly but gave ground all day to finish up slightly above Thursday's settlement of $0.6452.</p>
<p>Traders said they were surprised by sterling's resilience Friday in the face of developments in Parliament that ended Conservative Prime Minister John Major's governing majority.</p>
<p>Buoyed by bottom-fishing and expectations of a possible future hike in U.K. interest rates, December sterling ended pit action up well above Thursday's pit trading high of $1.6340.  </p>
<p>December Canadian dollars slid again Friday despite further intervention by the Bank of Canada and closed just six ticks above a nine-week low of $0.7348 set Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;You're just seeing an evacuation out of the Canadian dollar. I'm not sure exactly where, but I think it's going to be a good buy soon,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Commented another, &quot;They've just had a blood bath in the bonds. I don't think fundamentally it's justified.&quot;</p>
<p>At the end of pit trading, December yen were off $0.000051 at $0.008860, marks were up 0.0015 at $0.6467, Swiss francs were off $0.0013 at $0.7606, sterling was up 0.0138 at $1.6458, Canadian dollars were off $0.0016 at $0.7354, Australian dollars were off $0.0018 at $0.7961 and Mexican pesos were off 0.000575 at $0.125375.
