<p>Oppenheimer &amp; Co chief investment strategist Michael Metz has urged traders to warn investors the current bull market is running into trouble.</p>
<p>Metz, who describes himself as a long-time bear, said he advised traders at a meeting on Thursday to &quot;tell clients the bull market's underpinnings are deteriorating. I see the risks (in the market). I just don't see the rewards.&quot;</p>
<p>Metz said this week's third quarter productivity report and November payroll data showed a margin squeeze was about to begin and corporate earnings estimates for 1997 were too optimistic.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Dow Industrials underwent a wild ride after cautionary comments by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan sparked interest rate fears. The Dow was down 55.16 points, or 0.86 percent, at 6381.16 at its unofficial close. The long bond was down 4/32 to yield 6.52 percent.</p>
<p>Metz said the bond market was in a tough environment too, adding that last week flows into large cap mutual funds ended.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the bond market has problems. You've overshot on the downside on interest rates because of all the billions of dollars that have gone into leveraged positions in all debt markets the world over,&quot; he said.</p>
