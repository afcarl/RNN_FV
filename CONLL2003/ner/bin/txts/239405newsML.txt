ALTON, Ill. 1996-12-06

Argosy Gaming Co said Friday the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers gave final approval for construction of a riverboat casino and entertainment complex in Lawrenceburg, Ind., near Cincinnati.

Next Tuesday, the company plans to launch a 367-foot-long riverboat casino offering 21,000 square feet of gaming space. Construction will also begin immediately on a docking facility, said Argosy.

The permit allows construction of a 300-room luxury hotel and a parking structure.

Argosy Gaming is a developer of riverboat casinos and related entertainment complexes in the Midwest and South.
