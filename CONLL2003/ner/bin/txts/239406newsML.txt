Wall Street stocks suffered a broad sell-off on Friday after cautionary comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan about "irrational exuberance" in the financial markets raised the specter that the Fed might raise short-term interest rates.

The Dow Industrials unofficially closed down 55.16 to 6381.95, but plunged as much as 144.23 to 62.92.87 in the first 30 minutes of trading, said the New York Stock Exchange.

The Dow index finished the week down about 140 points, the first negative week since late October.  

Losers routed winners by a rate of four to one, with about 65 new lows and 50 new highs. Volume was moderately heavy at about 505 million shares.

"Greenspan tried to put cold water on the parade here," said Harvey Hirschhorn, chief economist and investment strategist at Stein Roe. "He was trying to temper the enthusiasm in the marketplace."

Greenspan said in a speech on Thursday night to the American Enterprise Institute that "irrational" market exuberance could damage the economy.  

Greenspan's comments shook up traders, who feared he was suggesting the possibility of higher interest rates.

"People are reading what he said as...the chairman believes there is excessive speculation in the marketplace today...and therefore, the Fed may move toward (interest rate) tightening," said Eugene Sit, chairman of Sit Mutual Funds.

The Greenspan comments sent overseas markets plunging on Friday, including the FTSE 100 Index, which skid more than two percent and the Nikkei, which dropped more than three percent.  

The comments also sent shudders through the bond markets. U.S. Treasuries fell 3/32 to yield 6.51 percent. But the long bond, which had fallen sharply overnight, was down almost a point-and-a-half in initial trading.

The 30-year bond cut most of its losses after the government reported weaker than expected U.S. jobs growth for November.

"The overall payroll data indicated that economic growth is moderate and employment gains were weaker than expected," said Hirschhorn.  

Instead of the 179,000 new jobs that the consensus forecast had predicted, the economy created just 118,000 new jobs during the month.

The unemployment rate rose as well, climbing to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent in October. Average hourly wages rose by nine cents, but did so after a one-cent decline to $11.90 an hour in October from $11.91 in September.

Some analysts expressed surprise at the Fed chairman.

"In all of my career, I can't remember a chairman of the Federal Reserve doing this kind of jawboning at the stock market," said Gerard Klauer Mattison bank analyst George Salem.  

"And it was rather heavy-handed, it wasn't subtle," he added.

Hirschhorn said that Greenspan's "non-verbal options are pretty limited at this time, given the lackluster economic environment, quiescent inflationary pressures and the continued favorable trend in the U.S. budget deficit."

Some strategists said the sharp market reaction to Greenspan's comments reflected a deeper fear that equities are reaching unsupportable highs.

"There's sort of a disguised bearish sentiment in the market," said Peggy Farley of Amas Securities.  

"The feeling is there's no reason for it to go up," Farley said. "People are afraid there's going to be a correction."

Bank stocks gyrated wildly. Salem noted that, when some of the higher-priced issues fell about $3 apiece at the lows, the stocks had corrected eight or nine percent from highs set only a few weeks ago.

He said traders who took profits recently, then jumped back in as buyers. Citicorp rose 1-7/8 to 103-1/2, and Chase Manhattan added 1/2 to 89-3/8.

Philip Morris posted a third straight day of gains, closing up 1-1/2 to 109-1/2.  

Analysts were bullish on U.S. cigarette consumption, believe the disposition of various tobacco litigation will be favorable to tobacco companies.

Advanced Micro Devices rose 2-1/2 to 26-1/8. Cowen & Co upgraded the rating on the stock to buy from neutral.

Among other indices, the S&P 500 fell 4.78 to 739.60; the Nasdaq Composite slid 12.44 to 1287.68, the NYSE Composite lost 2.60 to 390.15 and the broader Russell 2000 shed 3.55 to 355.50.
