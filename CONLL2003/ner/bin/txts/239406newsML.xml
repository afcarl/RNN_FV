<headline>U.S. stocks in broad fall on Greenspan caution.</headline>

<p>Wall Street stocks suffered a broad sell-off on Friday after cautionary comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan about &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in the financial markets raised the specter that the Fed might raise short-term interest rates.</p>
<p>The Dow Industrials unofficially closed down 55.16 to 6381.95, but plunged as much as 144.23 to 62.92.87 in the first 30 minutes of trading, said the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Dow index finished the week down about 140 points, the first negative week since late October.  </p>
<p>Losers routed winners by a rate of four to one, with about 65 new lows and 50 new highs. Volume was moderately heavy at about 505 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan tried to put cold water on the parade here,&quot; said Harvey Hirschhorn, chief economist and investment strategist at Stein Roe. &quot;He was trying to temper the enthusiasm in the marketplace.&quot;</p>
<p>Greenspan said in a speech on Thursday night to the American Enterprise Institute that &quot;irrational&quot; market exuberance could damage the economy.  </p>
<p>Greenspan's comments shook up traders, who feared he was suggesting the possibility of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;People are reading what he said as...the chairman believes there is excessive speculation in the marketplace today...and therefore, the Fed may move toward (interest rate) tightening,&quot; said Eugene Sit, chairman of Sit Mutual Funds.</p>
<p>The Greenspan comments sent overseas markets plunging on Friday, including the FTSE 100 Index, which skid more than two percent and the Nikkei, which dropped more than three percent.  </p>
<p>The comments also sent shudders through the bond markets. U.S. Treasuries fell 3/32 to yield 6.51 percent. But the long bond, which had fallen sharply overnight, was down almost a point-and-a-half in initial trading.</p>
<p>The 30-year bond cut most of its losses after the government reported weaker than expected U.S. jobs growth for November.</p>
<p>&quot;The overall payroll data indicated that economic growth is moderate and employment gains were weaker than expected,&quot; said Hirschhorn.  </p>
<p>Instead of the 179,000 new jobs that the consensus forecast had predicted, the economy created just 118,000 new jobs during the month.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate rose as well, climbing to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent in October. Average hourly wages rose by nine cents, but did so after a one-cent decline to $11.90 an hour in October from $11.91 in September.</p>
<p>Some analysts expressed surprise at the Fed chairman.</p>
<p>&quot;In all of my career, I can't remember a chairman of the Federal Reserve doing this kind of jawboning at the stock market,&quot; said Gerard Klauer Mattison bank analyst George Salem.  </p>
<p>&quot;And it was rather heavy-handed, it wasn't subtle,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Hirschhorn said that Greenspan's &quot;non-verbal options are pretty limited at this time, given the lackluster economic environment, quiescent inflationary pressures and the continued favorable trend in the U.S. budget deficit.&quot;</p>
<p>Some strategists said the sharp market reaction to Greenspan's comments reflected a deeper fear that equities are reaching unsupportable highs.</p>
<p>&quot;There's sort of a disguised bearish sentiment in the market,&quot; said Peggy Farley of Amas Securities.  </p>
<p>&quot;The feeling is there's no reason for it to go up,&quot; Farley said. &quot;People are afraid there's going to be a correction.&quot;</p>
<p>Bank stocks gyrated wildly. Salem noted that, when some of the higher-priced issues fell about $3 apiece at the lows, the stocks had corrected eight or nine percent from highs set only a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>He said traders who took profits recently, then jumped back in as buyers. Citicorp rose 1-7/8 to 103-1/2, and Chase Manhattan added 1/2 to 89-3/8.</p>
<p>Philip Morris posted a third straight day of gains, closing up 1-1/2 to 109-1/2.  </p>
<p>Analysts were bullish on U.S. cigarette consumption, believe the disposition of various tobacco litigation will be favorable to tobacco companies.</p>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices rose 2-1/2 to 26-1/8. Cowen &amp; Co upgraded the rating on the stock to buy from neutral.</p>
<p>Among other indices, the S&amp;P 500 fell 4.78 to 739.60; the Nasdaq Composite slid 12.44 to 1287.68, the NYSE Composite lost 2.60 to 390.15 and the broader Russell 2000 shed 3.55 to 355.50.</p>
