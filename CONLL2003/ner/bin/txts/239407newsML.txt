Sofamor seen up on Acromed settlement.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Shares in Sofamor DaSofamor Danek Group Inc rose sharply on Friday and a company executive attributed the rise to a liability settlement involving Acromed Corp, another maker of spinal implant devices.

Sofamor Danek shares were up 2-3/4, or 9.65 percent, to 31-1/4 in late afternoon. Volume was 367,100 shares.

"If things were going any better, I couldn't stand it," chief operating officer James Gallogly told Reuters when asked about the increase. He said the rise probably stemmed from a possible $100 million settlement involving Cleveland's Acromed, which faces about 4,000 liability cases involving spinal implant screws. An Acromed spokesman said the tentative settlement was reached in federal court in Philadelphia.

Gallogly said the Acromed settlement would set a rough limit of about $25,000 apiece for each plaintiff. Sofamor itself faces about 1,000 suits involving 2,500 plaintiffs over similar devices.

If each of the Sofamor cases were settled for $25,000, the total would be far less than the $300 million or $400 million that had been foreseen.
