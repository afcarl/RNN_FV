SEMINOLE, Texas 1996-12-06

Texas Equipment Corp said Friday it will buy three John Deere dealerships in Texas that should raise its annual revenues to $40 million.

The company said it is seeking to make more acquisitions and expects "strong growth in revenues and net income, both from farm equipment sales and from acquisitions in coming quarters."

"The farm equipment distribution and sales industry is ripe for consolidation," company President Paul Condit said in a release. "Texas Equipment's goal is to be a leading consolidator in our part of the country."  

The company said it presently has about $25 million in annual revenues. The acquisitions announced Friday are valued at $3.2 million and would be bought for a combination of cash and stock, the company said.

Texas Equipment reported net loss of $360,294 for nine months ended September 30, but said its farm equipment subsidiary had nine-month earnings of $431,786 on revenues of $19.5 million.

The company said it has filed for Nasdaq listing and expects approval sometime early in the first quarter 1997.

Texas Equipment was unchanged Friday afternoon at 3-1/8.
