<p>Texas Equipment Corp said Friday it will buy three John Deere dealerships in Texas that should raise its annual revenues to $40 million.</p>
<p>The company said it is seeking to make more acquisitions and expects &quot;strong growth in revenues and net income, both from farm equipment sales and from acquisitions in coming quarters.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The farm equipment distribution and sales industry is ripe for consolidation,&quot; company President Paul Condit said in a release. &quot;Texas Equipment's goal is to be a leading consolidator in our part of the country.&quot;  </p>
<p>The company said it presently has about $25 million in annual revenues. The acquisitions announced Friday are valued at $3.2 million and would be bought for a combination of cash and stock, the company said.</p>
<p>Texas Equipment reported net loss of $360,294 for nine months ended September 30, but said its farm equipment subsidiary had nine-month earnings of $431,786 on revenues of $19.5 million.</p>
<p>The company said it has filed for Nasdaq listing and expects approval sometime early in the first quarter 1997.</p>
<p>Texas Equipment was unchanged Friday afternoon at 3-1/8.</p>
