R.O.C. Taiwan won't make 1996 payout.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

The R.O.C. Taiwan Fund said on Friday it will not be making a dividend distribution to shareholders for 1996.

Since the Fund has a capital loss carry forward from previous years that exceeds the sum of its 1996 realized capital gains and had no net investment income, it is not required to make a distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the investment fund said.

The fund's last dividend of $0.75 a share was paid in January 1992, a company spokeswoman said.
