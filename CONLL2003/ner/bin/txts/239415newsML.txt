BOTHELL, Wash. 1996-12-06

CellPro Inc said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved its Ceprate SC Stem Cell Concentration system for purification of stem cells in bone marrow transplants.

The Ceprate system separates human stem cells from other cells in the bone marrow or peripheral blood. Stem cells are typically removed from the bone marrow of cancer patients, and then restored following high-dose chemotherapy, to reconstitute the patient's blood and immune system.
