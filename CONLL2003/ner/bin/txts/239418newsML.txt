Ingles markets to redeem notes due in 2000.

ASHEVILLE, N.C. 1996-12-06

Ingles Markets Inc said it will redeem its convertible subordinated debentures, due October 15, 2000, on January 20.

The company said it issued the debentures on October 15, 1988, as an indenture between it and the Connecticut National Bank -- which is now Fleet National Bank.

Holders of the debentures can convert them at any time before the close of business on January 16 into shares of the company's Class A common stock.

For each 1,000 principal of debentures, the conversion ratio would be 90.90, the company said.
