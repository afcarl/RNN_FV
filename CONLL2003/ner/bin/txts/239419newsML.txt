STUDIO CITY, Calif. 1996-12-12

Cinema Ride Inc said on Friday it expects revenues for the year ending December 31 to exceed $3.0 million, an increase of about 35 percent over 1995 sales.

Earlier, the company reported a third quarter net profit of $2,281, or nil per share, on revenue of $1.0 million versus a net loss of $513,936, or $0.11 a share, on revenue of $665,208 one year ago.

"We just opened our third location -- in the heart of Times Square in New York City -- and revenues from our Las Vegas location continue to excel," Mitch Francis, chief executive officer, said in a statement.

"Early indications are that revenues from our Times Square location will be comparable to those from our Las Vegas location," he added.

Francis also noted the company has been able to cut operating costs at each of its locations and is in discussions to obtain additional financing.
