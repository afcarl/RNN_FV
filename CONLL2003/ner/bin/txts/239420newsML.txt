CHICAGO 1996-12-06

Illinois Superconductor Corp said it knew of no reason for activity in its stock Friday, which traded as high as 17-1/4 during the day and hit an intra-day low of 14-3/4.

Shares in the early afternoon were up 3/4 at 17.

"There have been no announcements or corporate developments that would account for today's volatility," said Stephen Wasko, the company's chief financial officer.

"It's not unusual to see (the company's shares) down a dollar or a dollar and a quarter early in the day and then finish up one at the end of trading," said Wasko. "It doesn't happen every day, but this is not an unusual situation."

H.C. Wainwright & Co analyst Theodore O'Neill agreed.

"I've seen these types of wild swings (in Illinois Superconductor shares) during a day before," he said, "so this isn't something new."

Illinois Superconductor, which makes filters for the cellular telephone industry, announced a $3.2-million loss in the third quarter of fiscal 1996 in spite of a six-fold increase in overall sales to $25,000. (Corrects Q3 sales)

The company's shares were up 1/2 to 16-3/4.
