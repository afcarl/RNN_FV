U.S. mortgage-backeds lower after bumpy Fri ride.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

U.S. mortgage-backed securities cut some of their early losses late Friday afternoon after being pushed around by economic data and central bank comments, traders and analysts said.

Mortgages traded in line with Treasuries throughout much of the session. At 1520 EST/2020 GMT, pass throughs were off 1/32 to 6/32 overall. Spreads were little changed.

Mortgage banker selling dominated the activity throughout the day, traders said. There was "very little retail flow," one New York trader said.  

Current-coupon Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5 percent paper was off 4/32 at 100-11/32, yielding 123 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note. Comparable Fannie Maes were off 4/32 at 100-02/32, and Freddie Macs were off 5/32 at 100-09/32.

Ten-year Treasuries were off 7/32 at 101-25/32, yielding 6.25 percent.

The fixed-income markets had opened lower on comments Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made Thurday night at an American Enterprise Institute dinner, analysts said.  

Some analysts thought Greenspan's speech suggested the central bank chief sees potential inflation--and possibly higher interest rates as a result.

Early Friday morning, the November employment report caused further interest-rate concern when it showed average hourly earnings jumped 0.8 percent last month against a 0.1 percent decline the previous month.
