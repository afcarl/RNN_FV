<p>U.S. mortgage-backed securities cut some of their early losses late Friday afternoon after being pushed around by economic data and central bank comments, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Mortgages traded in line with Treasuries throughout much of the session. At 1520 EST/2020 GMT, pass throughs were off 1/32 to 6/32 overall. Spreads were little changed.</p>
<p>Mortgage banker selling dominated the activity throughout the day, traders said. There was &quot;very little retail flow,&quot; one New York trader said.  </p>
<p>Current-coupon Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5 percent paper was off 4/32 at 100-11/32, yielding 123 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note. Comparable Fannie Maes were off 4/32 at 100-02/32, and Freddie Macs were off 5/32 at 100-09/32.</p>
<p>Ten-year Treasuries were off 7/32 at 101-25/32, yielding 6.25 percent.</p>
<p>The fixed-income markets had opened lower on comments Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made Thurday night at an American Enterprise Institute dinner, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Some analysts thought Greenspan's speech suggested the central bank chief sees potential inflation--and possibly higher interest rates as a result.</p>
<p>Early Friday morning, the November employment report caused further interest-rate concern when it showed average hourly earnings jumped 0.8 percent last month against a 0.1 percent decline the previous month.</p>
