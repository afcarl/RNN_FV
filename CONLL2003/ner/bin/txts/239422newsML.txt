Angeion blames Q1 losss on research costs.

MINNEAPOLIS 1996-12-06

Angeion Corp said Friday its nearly $4-million net loss in its first quarter of fiscal 1997 can primarily be attributed to its research, development and manufacturing activities in the period.

The company also reported sales of $1.7 million, up from $155,330 a year ago. The latest figure was derived from original-equipment-manufacturer sales, clinical sales and initial direct market sales in Europe, Angeion said.

Angeion lost $3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 1996, mainly because of research and development costs.

Angeion makes equipment to treat irregular heartbeats.
