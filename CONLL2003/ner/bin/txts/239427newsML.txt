Motion to dismiss Orange County suit vs S&P denied.

SANTA ANA, Calif. 1996-12-06

A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge has rejected a motion by Standard & Poor's Corp to dismiss a $500 million lawsuit by Orange County, Calif., against the rating agency for its alleged role in the county's financial crisis.

In a written decision released on Friday, Judge John Ryan said S&P's "broad-based argument for dismissal of the complaint based on alleged First Amendment protections is without merit. The motion to dismiss based on the First Amendment is, therefore, denied."

County attorneys said the decision was a major victory.  

Earlier this year, Orange County sued McGraw-Hill Cos Inc's S&P for breach of contract, professional negligence and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.

The lawsuit alleged that S&P's ratings had assured the county and the public that former county Treasurer Robert Citron was "conservatively and safely" managing county funds.

In late August, S&P filed court papers seeking dismissal of the county claims in the suit on the grounds that its credit ratings were protected by the First Amendment.

Judge Ryan took the matter under submission after he was briefed by both sides and heard oral arguments in Santa Ana.  

In his long-awaited opinion, released Friday, Ryan said "the county has successfully pled both a breach of contract action and a professional negligence action against S&P."

But the judge said that the motion to dismiss the county's claim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty was granted.

S&P had argued in court that the "central defect with the county's complaint is that it disregards the constitutional requirements that must be observed by any party trying to recover on such claims against a publisher."  

S&P asserted that because it is a financial publisher, it is entitled to certain First Amendment protections.

S&P contended that the county must plead that the rating agency acted with "actual malice" -- that S&P either knowingly published false information or published this information with reckless disregard for the truth.

The county argued that the First Amendment does not insulate publishers from liability for breach of contract.

"I agree with the county that S&P's publisher status does not provide First Amendment protection as to all S&P's activities," Ryan wrote in his opinion.  

"Under the circumstances here, the county does not have to plead actual malice in order to maintain its claims," the judge wrote. "S&P's argument is off target."

An S&P spokesman said the rating agency was pleased that the judge granted its motion to dismiss the county's claim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.

"However, we will be renewing our motion to dismiss the important First Amendment and related issues before the federal District Court in the near future," S&P said.

County attorneys said they were pleased with the decision. "We are very pleased that the court properly rejected S&P's claim that the First Amendment gave it protection against the county's claims," said county attorney Michael Swartz.

Ryan's opinion on the motion to dismiss was expected to be his last in this case because the county's lawsuit against S&P was recently moved to the U.S. District Court.

Orange County filed for protection under Chapter 9 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code on Dec. 6, 1994, after sustaining investment losses of more than $1.6 billion.

The county emerged from bankruptcy in June.
