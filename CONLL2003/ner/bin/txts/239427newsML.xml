<headline>Motion to dismiss Orange County suit vs S&amp;P denied.</headline>
<dateline>SANTA ANA, Calif. 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge has rejected a motion by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp to dismiss a $500 million lawsuit by Orange County, Calif., against the rating agency for its alleged role in the county's financial crisis.</p>
<p>In a written decision released on Friday, Judge John Ryan said S&amp;P's &quot;broad-based argument for dismissal of the complaint based on alleged First Amendment protections is without merit. The motion to dismiss based on the First Amendment is, therefore, denied.&quot;</p>
<p>County attorneys said the decision was a major victory.  </p>
<p>Earlier this year, Orange County sued McGraw-Hill Cos Inc's S&amp;P for breach of contract, professional negligence and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleged that S&amp;P's ratings had assured the county and the public that former county Treasurer Robert Citron was &quot;conservatively and safely&quot; managing county funds.</p>
<p>In late August, S&amp;P filed court papers seeking dismissal of the county claims in the suit on the grounds that its credit ratings were protected by the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Judge Ryan took the matter under submission after he was briefed by both sides and heard oral arguments in Santa Ana.  </p>
<p>In his long-awaited opinion, released Friday, Ryan said &quot;the county has successfully pled both a breach of contract action and a professional negligence action against S&amp;P.&quot;</p>
<p>But the judge said that the motion to dismiss the county's claim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty was granted.</p>
<p>S&amp;P had argued in court that the &quot;central defect with the county's complaint is that it disregards the constitutional requirements that must be observed by any party trying to recover on such claims against a publisher.&quot;  </p>
<p>S&amp;P asserted that because it is a financial publisher, it is entitled to certain First Amendment protections.</p>
<p>S&amp;P contended that the county must plead that the rating agency acted with &quot;actual malice&quot; -- that S&amp;P either knowingly published false information or published this information with reckless disregard for the truth.</p>
<p>The county argued that the First Amendment does not insulate publishers from liability for breach of contract.</p>
<p>&quot;I agree with the county that S&amp;P's publisher status does not provide First Amendment protection as to all S&amp;P's activities,&quot; Ryan wrote in his opinion.  </p>
<p>&quot;Under the circumstances here, the county does not have to plead actual malice in order to maintain its claims,&quot; the judge wrote. &quot;S&amp;P's argument is off target.&quot;</p>
<p>An S&amp;P spokesman said the rating agency was pleased that the judge granted its motion to dismiss the county's claim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.</p>
<p>&quot;However, we will be renewing our motion to dismiss the important First Amendment and related issues before the federal District Court in the near future,&quot; S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>County attorneys said they were pleased with the decision. &quot;We are very pleased that the court properly rejected S&amp;P's claim that the First Amendment gave it protection against the county's claims,&quot; said county attorney Michael Swartz.</p>
<p>Ryan's opinion on the motion to dismiss was expected to be his last in this case because the county's lawsuit against S&amp;P was recently moved to the U.S. District Court.</p>
<p>Orange County filed for protection under Chapter 9 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code on Dec. 6, 1994, after sustaining investment losses of more than $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>The county emerged from bankruptcy in June.</p>
