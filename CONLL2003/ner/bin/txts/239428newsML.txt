CSCE world sugar ends higher in consolidation.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

CSCE world sugar prices ended firmer and near the day's highs after a dull session centered mainly on short covering by speculators and the trade, brokers said.

The market continued to consolidate from its steep, 37-point slide posted early in the week, but industry-type selling once again emerged toward the highs. The trade was a good buyer early in the day, with commission houses helping to push the market higher ahead of the close.

Key March delivery rose 0.09 cent a lb on the day, to 10.40 cents, while May gained 0.07 to close at 10.52. The outer months rose between 0.04 and 0.06 cent.

Despite the gains of the past fews session, traders said the market's hold on the upside was tenuous.

"The overall fundamental picture remains quite bearish," said one. "There hasn't been any good offtake for some time."

Technically, a potentially bearish upward flag formation was emerging on the charts, dealers said, signaling a brief correction before resuming the downtrend. Resistance looked fairly solid at 10.50 cents basis March, with key support seen in the 10.23-10.21 range.

With little fresh news to inspire the market, turnover was fairly light. An estimated 8,671 lots changed hands, including 488 against actuals.
