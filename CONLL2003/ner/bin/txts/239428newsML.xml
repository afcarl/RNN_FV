<title>USA: CSCE world sugar ends higher in consolidation.</title>

<p>CSCE world sugar prices ended firmer and near the day's highs after a dull session centered mainly on short covering by speculators and the trade, brokers said.</p>
<p>The market continued to consolidate from its steep, 37-point slide posted early in the week, but industry-type selling once again emerged toward the highs. The trade was a good buyer early in the day, with commission houses helping to push the market higher ahead of the close.</p>
<p>Key March delivery rose 0.09 cent a lb on the day, to 10.40 cents, while May gained 0.07 to close at 10.52. The outer months rose between 0.04 and 0.06 cent.</p>
<p>Despite the gains of the past fews session, traders said the market's hold on the upside was tenuous.</p>
<p>&quot;The overall fundamental picture remains quite bearish,&quot; said one. &quot;There hasn't been any good offtake for some time.&quot;</p>
<p>Technically, a potentially bearish upward flag formation was emerging on the charts, dealers said, signaling a brief correction before resuming the downtrend. Resistance looked fairly solid at 10.50 cents basis March, with key support seen in the 10.23-10.21 range.</p>
<p>With little fresh news to inspire the market, turnover was fairly light. An estimated 8,671 lots changed hands, including 488 against actuals.</p>
