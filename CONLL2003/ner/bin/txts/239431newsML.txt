Ecuador convertibility to aide reform -- de la Torre.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Ecuador's plan to peg its currency, the sucre, to the dollar at a four-to-one ratio will act as a catalyst for its broader reform, said Augusto de la Torre, manager of Ecuador's central bank.

"My sense is that there is a lot of truth in political economy arguments that convertibility can be a form of discipline that represents some kind of a short-cut to clean up a lot of institutions," de la Torre told a Latin American investment conference here.  

"What you will see is people who want credit are going to have to be deserivig of it, as the central bank (will be) no longer a convenient solution to their problem," he added.

De la Torre outlined four pillars of reform, covering the fiscal and financial sectors, the labor market and the partial privatization of strategic sectors, including mining, electricity and petroleum.

But de la Torre cautioned, "There is no explicit statement of preconditions that convertibility won't go through if you don't have the reforms."

Ecuadorean President Abdala Bucaram on Sunday announced the plan to peg the sucre to the dollar and enforce strict fiscal discipline and said the plan will begin July 1, 1997.
