First American asks court to reconsider.

ROSEMEAD, Calif. 1996-12-06

First American Bank of Rosemead said on Friday that it filed a motion requesting a federal court to reconsider a $6.87 million judgment against the company won by the Resolution Trust Corp (RTC) in November.

A hearing on the motion is scheduled for December 23.

The ruling, issued in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, granted the RTC the judgment plus 10 percent annual interest from October 30.

The dispute centered on a claim that the RTC was owed certain amounts by First American for its 1989 acquisition of First California Savings, a failed savings and loan.
