<title>USA: TRO Learning down after audit delay news.</title>
<headline>TRO Learning down after audit delay news.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Shares of TRO Learning Inc were down Friday after the company said its financial results for fiscal 1996, ended October 31, would be delayed about two weeks because its audit was taking longer than expected.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a bit unsettling,&quot; said Alexander Paris Jr, an analyst who follows the company for Barrington Research Associates Inc. &quot;It's a bit of a surprise.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based training and education systems company said there were no irregularities in the audit and the delay could be volume-related.</p>
<p>Paris said he expects the company to post revenues of about $50 million for the year, compared to $37 million a year earlier, with earnings a share up to $0.90 from $0.60 a year ago, provided nothing has changed with the audit.</p>
<p>He said more than 50 percent of the company's sales are booked in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no reason to believe that anything's out of the ordinary,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The stock was down 2-1/2 to 19-3/8 on Nasdaq Friday. It had fallen more than a point even before the announcement that year-end results would be delayed.</p>
