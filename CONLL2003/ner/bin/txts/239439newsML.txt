COMEX copper ends weaker but off lows, spot firmer.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

COMEX copper ended weaker, the market crawling back from the lows after opening sharply down after New York prices fell in line with LME overnight losses.

LME weakened after Friday's hike of 6,400 tonnes in stocks to 99,875 tonnes as inventory recovers from six-year lows.

But John Gross of the Copper Journal said that since the end of November, although LME stocks have increased, COMEX inventory has fallen more.

"Overall, inventories now are lower than they were at the end of November," Gross said.

Traders said the rise in LME stocks in recent weeks was due to metal from COMEX going into the London exchange's depot after the arbitrage switched in favor of LME.

March COMEX ended 1.10 cents weaker at 100.05 cents, traded 97.00 to 101.00 cents. Spot December went out 0.05 cent firmer at 104.90 cents.

Volume was estimated at 8,000 lots compared to Thursday's official 6,277 lots.

"At $1.00 per pound in March, the copper market is developing an area of support," Gross said.

COMEX stocks Thursday fell 2,958 short tons to 28,699 tons, down from some 40,000 tons a month ago.
