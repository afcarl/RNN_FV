<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>COMEX copper ended weaker, the market crawling back from the lows after opening sharply down after New York prices fell in line with LME overnight losses.</p>
<p>LME weakened after Friday's hike of 6,400 tonnes in stocks to 99,875 tonnes as inventory recovers from six-year lows.</p>
<p>But John Gross of the Copper Journal said that since the end of November, although LME stocks have increased, COMEX inventory has fallen more.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, inventories now are lower than they were at the end of November,&quot; Gross said.</p>
<p>Traders said the rise in LME stocks in recent weeks was due to metal from COMEX going into the London exchange's depot after the arbitrage switched in favor of LME.</p>
<p>March COMEX ended 1.10 cents weaker at 100.05 cents, traded 97.00 to 101.00 cents. Spot December went out 0.05 cent firmer at 104.90 cents.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 8,000 lots compared to Thursday's official 6,277 lots.</p>
<p>&quot;At $1.00 per pound in March, the copper market is developing an area of support,&quot; Gross said.</p>
<p>COMEX stocks Thursday fell 2,958 short tons to 28,699 tons, down from some 40,000 tons a month ago.</p>
