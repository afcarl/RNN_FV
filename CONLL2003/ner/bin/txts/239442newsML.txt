FAIRFAX, Va. 1996-12-06

Mobil Corp said Friday it signed an agreement to restructure the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC).

The agreement, with the pipeline's founding members, permits Mobil to exercise its right to acquire a 7.5 percent working interest in the 900-mile CPC, which will be constructed to pump oil from Kazakstan and Russia to the Black Sea, the company said.

The company also said it expects its share of capital expenditures for the pipeline to be about $310 million over the next three years.
