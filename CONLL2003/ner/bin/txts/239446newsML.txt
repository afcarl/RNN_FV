PanAmSat -Hughes waiting period expires.

GREENWICH, Conn. 1996-12-06

PanAmSat Corp said Friday the waiting period under federal antitrust law for the merger of its satellite services operation with that of Hughes Electronics Corp has expired.  

No further antitrust approvals are necessary for completing the merger, but the Federal Communications Commission is conducting a separate review, PanAmSat said.

In September PanAmSat and Hughes agreed to merge Hughes's Galaxy fleet of satellites providing video, voice and data communications. Galaxy is a trademark of Hughes Communications Inc, a unit of Hughes Electronics that provides cable and broadcast television satellite distribution services.

PanAmSat said the approval process for the merger is on track.
