Greenspan-no comment on markets reaction to speech.

PHILADELPHIA 1996-12-06

Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Friday declined to comment on world markets' reaction to a speech he made Thursday night in which he warned against "irrational exuberance" infecting financial markets.

"I'm not going to say anything, thank you," he told reporters after receiving an award when asked if he was surprised by the reaction to his speech in Washington.

He rarely responds to reporters' questions.

His remarks roiled stock and bond markets worldwide.

The Dow Jones Industrial index was off 36 points at 6401 at 2.05 p.m. EST (1905 GMT) after a morning fall to 6291.75.
