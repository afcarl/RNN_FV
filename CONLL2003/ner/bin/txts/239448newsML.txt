Soundview strategist says tech spending to rise.

PALO ALTO, Calif. 1996-12-06

SoundView Financial Group strategist James Townsend said on Friday that technology stocks were still worth buying because most big corporations planned to increase their spending on computers in 1997.

"We feel pretty comfortable with the technology sector," Townsend said, citing a survey his brokerage conducted recently that found major manufacturers plan to buy more computers and software in 1997 than they did this year.

Retail sales of PCs to consumers also could be "solid" during the holiday season despite discouraging early signs, Townsend said.

SoundView's bullish recommendation came on a day when almost every bellwether technology stock declined.

Microsoft Corp, Intel Corp, Compaq Computer Corp and International Business Machines Corp were lower in midafternoon trading.
