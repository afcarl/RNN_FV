Kellogg shares up after buyback annoucement.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

Shares of Kellogg Co rose 7/8 to 66-1/2 on Friday after the company announced earlier today a $400 million share buy-back authorization that was larger than expected.

"It's a bigger amount than I would have expected," said Schroder Wertheim analyst Robert Cummins.

He estimated that Kellogg would generate about $300 million in excess funds in 1997 after capital expenditures and dividends.

"I've been sort of assuming that ($300 million) would be the amount of the share buyback for next year," Cummins said.  

The share buyback, coupled with the previously announced plan to buy Lender's Bagels for $455 million, means Kellogg will have to increase its debt level, Cummins said.

Goldman Sachs analyst Nomi Ghez noted that Kellogg has typically been a large buyer of its stock. In 1996, its share authorization amounted to $550.7 million.

"I don't see this as a deviation from previous patterns," Ghez said, but conceded that the amount was somewhat larger than expected.  

She added that, while a share buyback is a positive -- reducing the overall number of shares outstanding for earnings comparisons -- it does not address Kellogg's more pressing problem of lost U.S. cereal market share.

"I would have been happier to see an announcement of a new and convincing cereal strategy or significantly new product...," Ghez said.
