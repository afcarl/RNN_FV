US Treasuries step back from 6.50 pct T-bond yield.

The benchmark U.S. Treasury bond retreated early Friday afternoon from a fleeting foray into the plus column as a market nervous from a bruising overnight plunge met resistance at 6.50 percent on the long bond yield.

The retreat coincided with some fresh remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan but traders said there was little direct correlation between Greenspan's comments in Philadelphia -- which focused on social security issues -- and the market's fluctuation.  

"The market was up near its (session) highs," said one government securities trader. "We didn't really see any immediate reaction (to Greenspan's comments)."

The trader said there might have been some "slight disappointment" that Greenspan did not sooth investors after ideas he expressed in a Washington lecture last night were interpreted by the financial markets as a warning against ebullience in valuing financial assets.

Treasury prices fell sharply overnight, as did world financial asset markets, after Greenspan said "irrational" market exuberance could damage the economy.  

After being down almost a point and a half in initial trading, the 30-year bond cut a majority of its losses after the government reported weaker than expected U.S. jobs growth for November. Instead of the 179,000 new jobs the consensus forecast had predicted, the economy created just 118,000 new jobs during the month. The unemployment rate rose as well, climbing to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent in October. Average hourly wages rose by nine cents, but did so after a one-cent decline to $11.90 an hour in October from $11.91 in September.  

The Treasury bond took its only trip into the plus column at midday, its yield briefly touching 6.50 percent before backing off in the face of resistance.

The short end of the market held in, benefitting from some flight to quality buying as financial markets were roiled and the stock market fell.

"There was some good buying in the short end mostly related to fears the stock market would have a bad day, but that abated when the stock market stabilized," a trader said.  

"What happened (overnight) was a liquidity driven down trade prior to the employment report," said Thomas Juterbock, managing director in charge of government bond trading at Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc. "The market had some Fed easing imbedded in its pricing structure and this morning, we walked in and there was 10 basis points of Fed tightening embedded in the market. Then the (November) employment report was benign and that Fed tightening has evaporated from the pricing structure. We're pretty close to neutral now."

Juterbock said he did not understand how "anybody concluded anything" from Greenspan's Thursday night lecture.  

"I just think the market was nervous, the price action was bad and there was profit-taking," he said.

At 1343 EST/1843 GMT, the 6-1/2 percent 30-year bond was down 11/32 to 99-18/32, yielding 6.53 percent. Before the jobs data, it was down nearly a point and a half.

The two-year note was unchanged at 99-26/32, yielding 5.73 percent. Five-year notes were down 6/32 to 99-11/32, yielding 6.03 percent. Ten-year notes were down 10/32 to 101-22/32, yielding 6.27 percent.

Three- and six-month bill rates were down two and one basis points, respectively, to 4.90 percent and 5.02 percent. Year bill rates were unchanged at 5.17 percent.
