Stratton Oakmont seeks stay of expulsion order.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

Stratton Oakmont, the New York brokerage expelled by the National Association of Securities Dealers on Thursday, has filed a petition with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a stay of the NASD action, an SEC spokesman said Friday.

"The SEC is considering the application," said spokesman John Heine. He did not elaborate.  

In its application, Stratton Oakmont said the sanction, which was ordered by NASD's regulatory arm, could result in "dire consequences" and abruptly terminate a program to make future payments of about $10 million to investors.

The brokerage asked that the stay be granted so that the SEC may hear its appeal on an expedited basis, noting that if the stay was not granted, "the right to appeal will effectively be rendered meaningless."

Lawyers representing Stratton president Daniel Porush, who was barred from the securities industry in the same action, have also filed for a stay of the NASD order.
