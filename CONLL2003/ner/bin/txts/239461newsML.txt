MINNEAPOLIS 1996-12-06

Orphan Medical Inc said Friday its first two drugs, Cystadane and Elliotts B Solution, are now commercially available.

Cystadane is the first drug that can be used to treat homocystinuria, a rare genetic disorder, said Orphan Medical. The condition can lead to mental and developmental retardation, nerve disorders, skeletal abnormalities and other manifestations.

Elliotts B Solution is used to treat meningeal leukemia or lymphocytic lymphoma, said the company.

Orphan Medical develops drugs for patients with inadequately treated or uncommon diseases.
