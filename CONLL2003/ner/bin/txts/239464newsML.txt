NEW YORK 1996-12-06

CompuServe Corp said on Friday that the number of people subscribing to its online computer service in Europe has doubled in the past 12 months to more than 850,000.

"We will continue to focus on those areas where we have clear competitive advantage and which offer strong potential for growth. The European market meets both criteria very well, and we will aim to extend both our localized content and market share in 1997," Chief Executive Bob Massey said in a news release.  

The company said it would introduce enhanced products and services in Europe for the business, technical and professional markets in early 1997. It said it expected strong growth in the European consumer and business-to-business markets to continue.
