DALTON, Ga. 1996-12-06

Shaw Industries Inc said Friday it planned to restructure its operations in Britain, which will result in a $35 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter.

Before the charge, it expects operating earnings for the quarter to be about $0.15 per share, slightly below analysts' consensus estimates, the company said.  

The First Call mean earnings estimate for the quarter is $0.19 per share.

Company officials were not available to comment further on the UK restructuring plans and if the plans involved layoffs.

"We are putting these operations in a position that should allow them to be profitable on a going-forward basis," Robert Shaw, chairman and chief executive officer, said.

Shaw makes and sells carpeting and rugs in the United States, Britain, Australia and Mexico and exports to Canada and other countries.
