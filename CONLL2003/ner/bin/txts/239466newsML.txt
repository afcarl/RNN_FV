Clinton says committed to balanced budget.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

President Clinton described himself Friday as "very much committed" to working with Republicans to produce a bipartisan balanced budget agreement.

"I'm very much committed to passing a bipartisan balanced budget plan with the Congress, which will keep our interest rates down, keep our economy growing and continue to honor our commitment to our children, our future, our economy, our parents and the quality of our environment," he told business leaders in a speech.

He said that although jobless figures for November showed a small increase in the unemployment rate, "wage increases continued to come to American workers because of increasing productivity."

"We had 118,000 more jobs, which means in the last three years and 10 months our economy has produced 11.9 million new working opportunities for the American people," he said. "Now we have to keep this going."
