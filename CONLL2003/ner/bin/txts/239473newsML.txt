Hirel to buy Marine Power Inc.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. 1996-12-06

Hirel Holdings Inc said Friday it had signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire the assets of Marine Power Inc, a Louisiana-based producer of marine engines, for undisclosed terms.

Marine Power, which generated gross sales of about $11 million for the fiscal year ended June 1996, would become a Hirel unit.

The deal is expected to be close by year-end, Hirel said.

It said the acquisition offered growth and expansion opportunities in both the marine power aftermarket and the original equipment manufacturer business.
