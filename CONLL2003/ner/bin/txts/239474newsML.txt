NTN cuts jobs, retires operating leases.

CARLSBAD, Calif. 1996-12-06

NTN Communications Inc on Friday said it reduced its workforce by 16 percent and plans to retire a majority of its operating leases in a move that will save the company $4.2 million annually.

The firm said the work force reduction, which will save about $1.1 million, was implemented across all levels of management.

The cut pares the firms staff to 184 persons from 218.

NTN said it has reached an agreement in principle to repay approximately $3.6 million in high cost operating leases resulting in annual cash flow savings of about $3.1 million.

"The repayment of our operating leases substantially reduces our cost of capital and relieves the operations from an enormous financial burden," Gerald Sokol Jr, the company's chief financial officer said in a statement said.
