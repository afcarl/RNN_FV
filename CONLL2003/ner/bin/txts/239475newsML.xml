<p>Traders on the frenetic floor of the New York Stock Exchange shrugged off Friday's early stock sell-off, saying any anxiety over the market's tumble did not build to a stampede of selling.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some anxiety, but there really was no panic,&quot; said independent floor broker Joseph Cangemi of Francis P. Maglio &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Brokers and stock specialists barked trades amid a flurry of order sheets, but described the activity on Friday as no busier than the average high-volume day on the exchange.  </p>
<p>&quot;I don't see much anxiety down here,&quot; said Christopher Quick, managing parter of JJC Specialist Corp, which handles buy and sell orders for stocks, including General Electric Co, Amoco Corp and Sears Roebuck and Co.</p>
<p>&quot;The market went up 600 points in a very short period of time and we're having a 150 point correction -- I don't think we're having any panic,&quot; Quick said.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials fell 145 points in early trading, partly undercut by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that the central bank must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; affects stock and other markets.  </p>
<p>Asian and European markets were rattled. Tokyo's key Nikkei index fell more than three percent, while the London bourse ended with its biggest point loss since 1992.</p>
<p>But Wall Street stocks pulled off their lows as the early wave of selling eased. The Dow was down about 62 points, or 1.0 percent, at 6374 in early afternoon dealings.</p>
<p>With U.S. inflation and interest rates low, stocks still appear attractive relative to other investments such as bonds or bank savings accounts, traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The old saying that this is the only game in town still applies,&quot; said James Maguire, chairman of specialist firm Henderson Brothers.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been no landslide to get off this bandwagon,&quot; Maguire added.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after the record bull run on Wall Street, some investors appeared wary that more downturns, rather than rallies, could be ahead, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;No one's anxious that (the market's) going to go up,&quot; Cangemi said.</p>
