Henkel - Loctite pact carries breakup fee.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

The merger agreement between Henkel KGaA and Loctite Corp carries a termination fee of $40 million, documents filed on Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed.

According to the documents, Loctite will have to pay the fee to Henkel if the merger deal is terminated due to, among other things, Loctite having approved a competing acqusition offer.

Dusseldorf-based Henkel is to pay $61 cash per share, or $1.3 billion, for the 65 percent of Loctite common stock it does not already own.  

A Henkel tender offer for the shares will expire at midnight December 20 unless extended.

Under the merger agreement, the deal may be terminated by mutual consent of both companies if the merger is not consummated by June 30, 1997, or if any court, government or regulatory agency rules against it, according to the documents.

In accepting the Henkel offer, Hartford, Conn.,-based Loctite received an opinion from its financial adviser, Dillon, Read & Co Inc, which said the bid was fair to shareholders "from a financial point of view," according to the documents.

Loctite is an adhesives and speciality chemicals company.
