Star says damage minimal at Lousiana unit.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Star Enterprises countered market rumors Friday, calling the damage "fairly minimal" at its 40,000 barrel per day (bpd) H-oil unit at its Convent, Louisiana refinery after a fire Wednesday evening.

A company spokeswoman refused to say when the unit would return to operation, but described reports that it would be down for 12 weeks as "very excessive."

"The fire with all the black smoke looked worse than it was," spokeswoman said. About 10 percent of a 40,000 barrel per day (bpd) H-oil unit was damaged, she said. The Convent refinery has a crude distillation capacity of 225,000 bpd.

The H-oil unit processes heavy feedstocks, such as residual fuel, into lighter products including No. 2 heating oil and even gasoline.

The outage could put "a little more constriction on the products' market," said Paulo Nery, analyst with Pace Consultants in Houston. The reduced output could add to the current inventory tightness, Nery added, though some traders said record-high distillate production should mute the price impact caused by the H-oil unit's idling.

NYMEX product futures surged early Thursday on the news of the fire, though there appeared to be little lasting effect.

Physical market traders said refined product prices showed little interest in the news, though the outage did lend downward pressure to high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO).

"I agree that (40,000 bpd) is something. Nevertheless, it's not a major event," said one trader, referring to the outage's effect on the heating oil, diesel and jet fuel markets.

"High sulphur is off because of excess production in the Gulf," said one residual fuel trader.

Traders said HSFO buyers headed for the sidelines amid speculation the damaged H-oil plant could mean up to 40,000 barrels per day of four percent sulphur content HSFO on the market for a period of weeks.

U.S. Gulf Coast three percent HSFO tumbled Thursday by 50-75 cents on the refinery fears to about $16.75 a barrel.

Star is a 50-50 joint venture between Texaco and state-owned Saudi Aramco.
