<headline>Star says damage minimal at Lousiana unit.</headline>

<p>Star Enterprises countered market rumors Friday, calling the damage &quot;fairly minimal&quot; at its 40,000 barrel per day (bpd) H-oil unit at its Convent, Louisiana refinery after a fire Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>A company spokeswoman refused to say when the unit would return to operation, but described reports that it would be down for 12 weeks as &quot;very excessive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The fire with all the black smoke looked worse than it was,&quot; spokeswoman said. About 10 percent of a 40,000 barrel per day (bpd) H-oil unit was damaged, she said. The Convent refinery has a crude distillation capacity of 225,000 bpd.</p>
<p>The H-oil unit processes heavy feedstocks, such as residual fuel, into lighter products including No. 2 heating oil and even gasoline.</p>
<p>The outage could put &quot;a little more constriction on the products' market,&quot; said Paulo Nery, analyst with Pace Consultants in Houston. The reduced output could add to the current inventory tightness, Nery added, though some traders said record-high distillate production should mute the price impact caused by the H-oil unit's idling.</p>
<p>NYMEX product futures surged early Thursday on the news of the fire, though there appeared to be little lasting effect.</p>
<p>Physical market traders said refined product prices showed little interest in the news, though the outage did lend downward pressure to high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO).</p>
<p>&quot;I agree that (40,000 bpd) is something. Nevertheless, it's not a major event,&quot; said one trader, referring to the outage's effect on the heating oil, diesel and jet fuel markets.</p>
<p>&quot;High sulphur is off because of excess production in the Gulf,&quot; said one residual fuel trader.</p>
<p>Traders said HSFO buyers headed for the sidelines amid speculation the damaged H-oil plant could mean up to 40,000 barrels per day of four percent sulphur content HSFO on the market for a period of weeks.</p>
<p>U.S. Gulf Coast three percent HSFO tumbled Thursday by 50-75 cents on the refinery fears to about $16.75 a barrel.</p>
<p>Star is a 50-50 joint venture between Texaco and state-owned Saudi Aramco.</p>
