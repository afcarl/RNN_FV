Duff upgrades Interstate Insurance paying ability.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co said Friday it upgraded the claims paying ability rating of the Interstate Insurance Group to double-A-minus from single-A-plus.

The upgrade reflects the rating agency's increased comfort that Interstate will benefit from the above-average flexibility that comes with being part of a larger, more diversified parent.

The group consists of Interstate Fire & Casualty Co and its two subsidiaries, Interstate Indemnity Co and Chicago Insurance Co, said Duff & Phelps.

Interstate is owned by Firemen's Fund Insurance Co, which is a subsidiary of Allianz AG Holding of Germany.
