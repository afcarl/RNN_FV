Wall Street stocks cut about half of their steep losses at midday after a wild morning of trading that saw the Dow Industrials plunge over 140 points, after comments on inflation and the markets made by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan late Thursday sparked interest rate fears.

The Dow Industrials were off about 0.89 percent, or 57 points to 6380. The broader market also fell, with the Standard & Poor's 500 Index off 7.60 to 736.78 and the Nasdaq Composite off 15 to 1285.  

Greenspan said late on Thusday that the Federal Reserve was keeping a close eye on the financial markets when they are affected by "irrational exuberance" and said that although inflation was low, its future course was uncertain.

Analysts said that stock markets, already said to be overbought in light of their recent huge gains, were on a hair trigger.

"In another market, his comments would have been ignored but he made them at a time when the market was extraordinarily vulnerable," said Gary Anderson of Anderson & Loe, a firm that advises money managers.  

The comments rocked overseas markets. In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei-225 share index fell 667 points, or 3.2 percent, to 20,277. And London's FTSE-100 slumped 139.5 points, or 3.4 percent, to 3911.7. The dollar also buckled.

U.S. stocks headed downhill immediately after the opening of trading. They later began slowly climbing off their lows and stabilized, but at sharply lower levels with a very cautionary mood prevailing on Wall Street.

"The worst of it happened earlier and then cooler heads prevailed," said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer for Gruntal & Co.  

"The short-term stock owners have jumped all over the comments and they are selling. But I view sell-offs like this, where the fundamentals are still the same, as a buying opportunity. I'm not sure where we will stabilize, but I don't expect (it to get worse) any big correction to happen," Battipaglia said, noting that none of the economic fundamentals underlying the market have changed.

"But we are all more nervous now," he said.

"The army of of bulls, which had been on a blitzkrieg ... just suddenly ran into machine gun fire," Anderson said.  

The activity triggered the New York Stock Exchange's "sidecar" curbs for the eleventh time this year. If the Standard & Poor's 500 Index futures index falls 12 points or more from the previous day's close, the sidecars prohibit index arbitrage orders unless they are stabilizing, meaning buys if the index is falling or sells if the index rises.

Philip Morris Cos Inc bucked the trend in the Dow, rising 1-5/8 to 109-5/8 after the stock was upgraded by Salomon Brothers analyst Diana Temple. She also said she expected the company to earn even more in 1997 than she previously forecast.  

IBM Corp shares weighed heavily on the Dow, off 2-1/4 to 156-1/8 in heavy trading.

CAI Wireless Systems Inc shares lost almost half their value falling 1-3/16 to 1-9/16 after Bell Atlantic and merger partner NYNEX said they would re-evaluate their video plans and possibly a $100 million investment in CAI.
