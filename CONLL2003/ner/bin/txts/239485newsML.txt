Chevron to buy stake in Russian pipeline.

SAN FRANCISCO 1996-12-06

Chevron Corp said on Friday it has signed an agreement to acquire a 15 percent equity interest in a pipeline running from the Tengiz oil field in western Kazakstan to the Russian Black Sea Coast.

The pipeline, being built by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, will ultimately have the capacity to move 1.5 million barrels of oil per day.

Chevron's acquisition came through an agreement signed in Moscow on the restructuring of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, the company said in a statement.  

The new pact is expected to be finalized by February 1997. Several oil companies will fund construction of the estimated $2.0 billion cost for a 50 percent equity interest. The pipeline is expected to be commissioned in 1999, Chevron said.

"This world-class infrastructure development project will be a model to other foreign investors in the former Soviet Union," said Richard Matzke, president of Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc.

Chevron estimated the Russian government will receive an estimated $20 billion in taxes and tariff revenue over the project's 40-year life.

The principal source of oil will be the Tengiz oil field, which is 50-percent owned and operated by Chevron in conjunction with Kazakstan.

The participants in the pipeline, with their equity interests, include the governments of Russia (24 percent), Kazakstan (19 percent) and Oman (7 percent), Chevron (15 percent), LUKoil (12.5 percent), Rosneft (7.5 percent), Mobil Corp (7.5 percent), Agip (2 percent), British Gas Plc (2 percent), Kazak Munaigas (1.75 percent), and Oryx Energy Co (1.75 percent).
