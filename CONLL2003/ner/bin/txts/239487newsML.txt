U.S. markets buckle on Greenspan euphoria warning.

U.S. stocks and bonds tumbled on Friday, a day after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made bearishly construed comments on the financial markets.

But an even steeper sell-off was averted, thanks to a weak monthly payrolls report. The jobs data offset worries about Fed rate policy that had also flared up because of Greenspan's comments, included in a lecture delivered in Washington.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 78 points to 6360 and the 30-year U.S. Treasury fell 9/32 to yield 6.53 percent.  

"How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions...?" he asked. "And how do we factor that assessment into monetary policy?"

Ironically, today's payrolls report would likely have intensified the recent buying spree, because it offered new evidence of a moderating economy only a day after a sharp sell-off in bonds.

Instead, Greenspan's message completely overshadowed the report and analysts said Greenspan may well be satisfied with the result.  

"I think he accomplished what he wanted," said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock & Co. "He let a little air out of the balloon."

Barthel said he suspected that instead of tipping his hand about the possibility of future monetary tightenings, Greenspan was seeking to protect a rapidly eroding degree of flexibility to ease rates.

"He was watching weak economic news and a stock market that was bubbling," Barthel said. "He knew that might restrict him from lowering rates if he had to."  

Some questions about Greenspan's intent may be answered during his next speech, scheduled for later today in Philadelphia. Few questions remain about how market participants felt.

Matters appeared particularly gloomy in the early moments.

The Chicago Board Options Exchange delayed the opening of trading in all broad based stock index options and prior to the payrolls report, and the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury was off by more than a full point. The malaise also hit the dollar, which fell two pfennigs against the mark overnight.  

But then came the payrolls report, which helped the long bond bounce off its early lows and allowed the dollar to recoup about half its overnight loss.

"Certainly the report took some of the pressure off," said Kevin Lawrie, global foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank. "It snatched us from the jaws of doom."

Likewise, stocks saw their fortunes improve after an early skid of more than 140 points in Dow Jones industrials. By late morning, the Dow had slashed those losses by more than half.

Whether stocks can resume their run is an open question. Analysts say the answer may rest with bonds.

"The last 500 points in the Dow were somewhat fluffy," said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Gruntal & Co. "They related to a structural shift in the interest rate outlook from a seven percent long bond to an outlook of the rate going below 6.5 percent."

With the effects of today's sell-off, the yield on the 30-year bond now stands firmly above that 6.5 percent level.
