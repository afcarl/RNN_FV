HOLLAND, Mich. 1996-12-06

Donnelly Corp said Friday its board had approved a five-for-four split of the company's Class A and Class B common stock. It also said it expects a dividend increase.

The split is payable January 30, record January 6.

Donnelly said it expects to maintain its $0.10 a share quarterly dividend on post-split shares. That would have the effect of increasing the dividend 25 percent.
