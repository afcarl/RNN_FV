Americans keep piling on debt, but spend anyway.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

With the holiday shopping season in full swing, it appears that the piles of debt consumers keep racking up are not holding them back as much as expected.

Americans have accumulated nearly $1.18 trillion in instalment debt, up from $1.1 trillion at the end of 1995 and $999.7 billion in March 1995, according to the Federal Reserve's latest data released in November. Meanwhile, credit card delinquencies are also rising, but consumers are still shopping like there is no tomorrow, at least according to the latest anecdotal evidence.  

Despite losing five days of the holiday shopping season because of a late Thanksgiving, analysts predict a five to six percent increase in sales over last year's shopping season.

"Every indication we have says per-person spending is up and people have intentions to spend even more than last year," said William Ford, former Atlanta Fed president and current advisor to TeleCheck, which tracks consumers purchases by check.

Yet many observers, including Fed governor Lawrence Lindsey, believe the high debt levels are problematic.  

"When one looks at the data...this expansion does raise some troubling statistics," Lindsey said at a conference sponsored by the Consumer Ferderation of America in Washington Thursday. "Roughly for every extra one dollar we're earning, we're spending $1.10. This is not a sustainable trend."

Private economists, though, dismiss high debt levels as merely a sign of consumers' optimism about the economy's prospects. Some even say the debt figures are misleading, since consumers now use credit cards for almost everything, because many cards offer airline miles for every dollar charged.  

Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., noted that consumers' debt burden, as measured by the Fed, is lower now than before the 1990 recession.

In December 1989, total U.S. debt -- including mortgages -- equalled 17.6 percent of disposable income. It dropped as low as 15.3 percent at the end of 1993, and stood at 17 percent in the third quarter of this year, having levelled off somewhat since the first quarter.

Excluding mortgages, though, the debt burden is at a record high 11.2 percent, up from a 1989 peak of 10.8 percent.  

"The accumulation of debt has slowed," Ricchiuto said. "Therefore, you have to question whether debt levels are a problem."

Indeed, consumer spending was strong in the first half of 1996, before slowing in the third quarter. Michael Niemira, an economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, expects real spending to rise 2.0 to 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter.

"Consumption does not fall off a cliff," he said. "You have to have an external shock. In 1980, when (president Jimmy) Carter talked about credit controls, that was a big shock."  

Niemira said he sees little correlation between high debt levels and spending patterns. The more telling sign, he said,  is credit availability, which has been high in recent years.

Telechek's Ford noted that while banks have tightened credit standards in recent months, credit is still relatively easy to get.

"Merchants are saying, 'buy now with no interest until next year,'" said Ford, also an economics professor at Middle Tennessee State University. "A wider availability of stores are providing credit and are helping consumers now. But they'll have to pay the piper later."  

Economists generally see no reason for spending to slow in the near future, especially as the surge in the stock market has padded many Americans' balance sheets.

"Income and employment growth are strong, the unemployment rate is very low, inflation seems under control at a low rate, interest rates are relatively low and have come down in the last few weeks, and consumer confidence -- whichever index you use -- is at very high levels," said Ira Silver, manager of planning and forecasting and chief economist at J.C. Penney Co Inc. "Consumers have the wherewithal to spend and the willingness to spend."  

But Silver noted that the high debt levels may affect some sectors. "Where debt affects spending is big-ticket items," he said. "If you have too much debt you are more likely to hold back on buying a $2,000 projection TV than an $80 sweater."

The latest store sales data released on Thursday confirm that is happening. Sales at computer and electronics stores underperformed in November, while apparel stores posted strong gains.

Economists shrug at record high debt levels, noting consumers are using credit in different ways than just a few years ago.  

"For over two years there has been an increase of credit card use to buy groceries and gasoline, which used to be done by checks," Ford said. "For 96 percent to 98 percent of them, instead of writing one check a week, they are now getting airline miles and writing only one check a month."

He noted that the Salvation Army now takes credit cards and some municipalities allow drivers to pay speeding violation fines with credit cards on the spot.

And, he added, many of those charges are paid off at the end of the month, making the actual debt data less "scary."

Looking past the holidays, economists anticipate a spending pause in the first quarter of 1997 as consumers pay off those holiday bills.

"Debt is not going to go away," Silver said. "But Americans like to give gifts, unless things are (economically) terrible. And things are not terrible this year."
