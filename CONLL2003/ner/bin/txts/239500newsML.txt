NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Saks Holdings Inc said Friday it has identified about 20 new stores and 12 expansion projects in California, Texas, Florida and the New York area in fiscal 1997 and 1998.

Saks said many of the new stores and expansions represent additions to its original growth plans for the next two years.  

The company will open six new stores in California, five stores in Texas and two in North Carolina, along with new stores in Long Island and Woodbury in New York, Massachusettes, Arizona, Nevada and Colorado.

Stores in Florida, Texas, California, New York, Chicago, Michigan, Ohio and New Orleans will expand, Saks said. The Beverly Hills store will grow by 12,000 square feet and selling space in the New York flagship store will grow by 20,000 square feet, spokeswoman Jennifer Mann said.

"This major initiative underscores Saks' growth strategy of building regional dominance in key markets," Chairman Philip Miller said in a release.
