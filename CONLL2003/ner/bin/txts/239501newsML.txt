Earlier on Friday, corporate syndicate sources reported that the firm would issue $1.0 billion in a multi-tranche debt offering as early as next week.

The company said Salomon Brothers Inc will be the lead manager on the offering, with CS First Boston, Chase Securities Inc and JP Morgan Securities Inc as co-managers.

Proceeds from the offering will be used to refinance a portion of the $1.9 billion of debt arising from the February 1996 acquisition of CarnaudMetalbox S.A., the company said.

The balance of the acquisition debt will continue to be financed through bank loans, it said.

On November 26 the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer up to $1.5 billion of debt securities, with plans to issue about $1.2 billion of the securities shortly after the registration became effective.
