Wall St near-term outlook gloomier amid rate fears.

Wall Street was rocked Friday by renewed fears of higher interest rates and inflation after comments by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, and more price erosion is seen after the market's recent spectacular run.

David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, said he had expressed his concerns about the market to a Fed meeting on Tuesday. "I said S&P 500 earnings are trading at just under 19 times earnings and that's where the market peaked in 1968, 1972 and 1987. I was worried 1997 earnings might only go up five percent so the P/E would remain high."  

Shulman said he was one of about a dozen people invited to speak with the Fed on the economy and the stock market.

On Thursday night, Greenspan told the conservative American Enterprise Institute that the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets because they could end up damaging the economy.

The Dow industrials surged eight percent or 500 points in November as Wall Street celebrated a continuation of a politically divided U.S. government, an economy growing at a more sustainable pace and a growing conviction that interest rates would hold steady through the first half of 1997.  

Throughout November, the blue chip index posted 12 record closing highs.

The Dow early Friday was off 89 points or 1.39 percent to 6347 after hitting 6291.75 earlier. The Nasdaq Composite was off 25 points or 1.93 percent to 1275. The S&P 500 lost 10 points or 1.37 percent to 734.

The long bond slumped 20/32 to yield 6.55 percent after shedding nearly 1-1/2 points on Thursday.

The November non-farm payrolls report was seen as a saving grace, providing a support for the markets when the headline number of 118,000 was much softer than the expected 179,000.  

But Wall Street, for now, appeared to be overlooking the jump in average hourly earnings by nine cents to $11.99 and prospects for a strong December report as a later Thanksgiving delayed seasonal hirings.

As for stocks, Shulman said November 25's S&P 500 close of 757.03, the record closing high for the index of major U.S. companies, "is probably the high for the year." What he did not tell the Fed was his 1997 forecast. "If we're lucky, and that depends on the economy and rates, we'll be in a trading range environment. At worst, a 10-15 percent drop which is not a big deal" given the market's run in 1995 and this year.  

"The markets are reacting to the risk of higher inflation and the leaning by the Fed to tighten if needed on price inflation. And now there's the added notion of stock market behavior as a forward-looking indicator for the Fed," he said.

"What (Greenspan) said wasn't new and not how he looks at the processes of the economy but he said it (publicly) for the first time." Sinai added, "Certainly, the behavior of the stock market is one of the items to look at to determine what the future course of the economy might be. A booming stock market raises the flag of potential higher inflation, but not to the same extent as wage inflation."  

William LeFevre, a senior market analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, said, "Since right after the election we were looking for a pause and we're getting it."

"The first area of support is 6300. If that's broken, and it's not that solid, then it's 6000-6100. But we're up 1400 points from the start of the year to the end of November. Getting back to 6000 would not be 10 percent and that constitutes a correction."
