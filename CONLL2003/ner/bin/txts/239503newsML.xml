<p>A former cabinet minister in Central African Republic and his son were abducted from home and murdered in growing ethnic violence in the capital Bangui, a government minister said on Friday.</p>
<p>With violence spiralling out of control, the United Nations evacuated its staff in Bangui to Ivory Coast on Friday. An official from the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said a chartered plane brought evacuees to Abidjan.</p>
<p>&quot;We are talking of about 80 people from the whole U.N. system,&quot; the official added.</p>
<p>Separately, officials in Brazzaville said 300 refugees, some armed, had crossed from Central African Republic into the northern Congolese town of Betou. The Central African Republic district across from Betou is the base of a rebel group opposed to the government in Bangui.</p>
<p>France voiced backing for the elected Bangui government but said its troops based in the former colony under defence pacts would not help it combat soldiers who began a mutiny on November 16.</p>
<p>&quot;France cannot be involved in the domestic political debate,&quot; President Jacques Chirac told a news conference at the end of a Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso.</p>
<p>&quot;French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In Paris two dozen nationals of Central African Republic occupied their country's Paris embassy on Friday, demanding President Ange-Felix Patasse's resignation.</p>
<p>&quot;We ask for peace, the resignation of President Patasse and an end to intervention by French forces,&quot; said one of the occupiers. &quot;We say 'no' to French forces and 'yes' to the establishment of democracy.&quot;</p>
<p>Public Service Minister David Dofara, head of the national Red Cross, told Reuters he had seen the bodies of former interior minister Christophe Grelombe and his son, who was not named.</p>
<p>Witnesses said they had been seized by troops loyal to Patasse at dawn on Thursday from their home close to the presidential palace, which is guarded by loyalist soldiers backed by French troops based in Bangui.</p>
<p>The bodies were found on Thursday in an open field about two km (one mile) further away, said Dofora and other witnesses.</p>
<p>Grelombe is from the Yakoma tribe to which most rebel soldiers belong. The uprising began over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple Patasse, sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital.</p>
<p>The men were seized as loyalist forces and French troops battled mutineers who fired rockets into the city centre. A French-owned hotel was slightly damaged.</p>
<p>Yakomas are hounded in stronghold districts of Patasse's Baya people while other tribes have fled areas in rebel hands.</p>
<p>Roadblocks have been erected in city districts while central Bangui, patrolled by French troops with tanks, is deserted. Shops and businesses have remained shut this week.</p>
<p>The Franco-African summit decided to send a mission to Bangui to seek ways of containing the mutiny and a threat of civil war.</p>
