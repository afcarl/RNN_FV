A Franco-African summit on Friday reaffirmed the need for a multinational force to help get food to war refugees in Zaire, opposing mere food airdrops.

A statement issued at the end of the 46-nation meeting called for urgent relief for refugees and urged the United Nations to deploy a multinational force agreed on by the Security Council last month for eastern Zaire.

It called on the regional states to halt fighting and open negotiations leading to an international peace conference to find a lasting solution and a regional "pact of stability".

The African countries, faced with a blunt warning that deficit-cutting rich countries would strike undemocratic governments out of their aid list, also pledged to work for social justice and human rights.

French President Jacques Chirac told a news conference the summit had fostered broad dialogue between the region's antagonists. The idea of an international peace conference sponsored by the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity had "advanced somewhat", he added.

"All the participants in the area spoke without any rancour, and listened," he said. "They are all returning home with a better understanding of the others' positions."

Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda took part in the meeting which discussed the Great Lakes conflict for four hours on Thursday. Zaire accuses Uganda of aggression, and Rwanda of backing rebels who have taken a large swath of eastern Zaire.

The statement stressed the need to respect sovereignty, and Chirac said participants "unanimously affirmed that the inviolability of borders must not in any case be called into question".

Although foreign ministers worked into the night to iron out differences on the final statement, Rwanda held reservations on unspecified points. Eritrea and Ethiopia dropped earlier objections, also undisclosed.

Rwanda opposes the U.N. multinational force to help get food to refugees fleeing fighting in the Kivu region of east Zaire. Kigali says most of the refugees have returned home to Rwanda.

Host President Blaise Compaore said half of the Rwanda refugees were still in Zaire. "We see no other way for the international community than going on the spot...We need a (multinational) intervention force," he told the news conference.

Chirac said summit participants were unanimous in opposing watering down international intervention to mere food airdrops to the refugees.

The summit included a special condemnation of "criminals" using children soldiers and a call for abolition of anti-personnel mines that it said killed hundreds of people on the continent every week.

Parts of the joint statement read like a code of conduct defining "good governance", a condition set by Chirac for continued development aid.

The pledges included making economic reforms with coherent long-term views, ensuring efficient management of public affairs and giving the military a backseat.

In return, rich countries must step up aid to the developing world, the statement said.

The Declaration of Ouagadougou, if respected, could be a milestone for a continent plunged in wars, coups and civil strife, where many countries have been accused of wasting aid and abusing human rights.

Compaore hailed the "spirit of Ouagadougou" as making clear that good governance was the responsibility of African governments. "The main role is the Africans'," he told the news conference. "Africa must realise that it must get organised."

Chirac said aid and private investment was dependent on confidence. "There will not be confidence without respect of democracy," he told the news conference.
