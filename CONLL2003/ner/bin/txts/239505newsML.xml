<p>Zairean rebels said on Friday they were preparing to attack a key town in eastern Zaire and an aid agency reported more than 100,000 Rwandan refugees trekking northwest in a huge column.</p>
<p>&quot;We are moving towards Bunia tomorrow (Saturday),&quot; said a Zairean rebel officer in the town of Beni, 140 km (85 km) southwest of Bunia. &quot;The Mai-Mai are moving up now to Bunia.&quot;</p>
<p>About 150 members of the Mai-Mai, a volatile militia group which practises witchcraft, were in Beni. In their advance north and west since October, the Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels have been using them to terrify Zairean troops into fleeing.</p>
<p>Aid sources said that Bunia, which the rebels originally claimed to have seized last Tuesday, was still in the hands of the Zairean army which had received air-borne troop reinforcements from Kisangani, the largest city in the region.</p>
<p>In Kisangani on Friday, Nicholas Louis of the medical aid agency Medecins sans Frontieres said more than 100,000 Rwandan refugees had arrived at the town of Walikale.</p>
<p>At one stage refugees flowed into Walikale, 100 km (60 miles) west of the Rwandan border, at 20 every second. &quot;It was like a tidal wave and they are still pouring in, thousands upon thousands,&quot; said Louis, in radio contact with towns in the area.</p>
<p>He said that by Thursday morning a vanguard of about 1,500 refugees had staggered into the town of Lubutu, 180 km (110 miles) further west from Walikale, on the road to Kisangani.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of them are very weak and they are dying on the road... The biggest cause of death is malaria,&quot; said Louis, adding they were clearly some of those who went missing after rebels seized control of the area from the Zairean army.</p>
<p>Camps with some 1.2 million people broke up and more than 500,000 Rwandans went home. But foreign reconnaissance flights found only a fraction of the remaining hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril, the Canadian general in charge of a multinational force for eastern Zaire, said in Nairobi on Friday he would return to rebel-held Zaire for more information on the plight of refugees in the countryside.</p>
<p>The small multinational force based in Uganda has been unable to deploy in Zaire because of opposition both from the Kinshasa government and the rebels.</p>
<p>A fight for Bunia is widely expected to be fierce because many of the troops at the garrison are natives of the town and they have been strengthened by units of the elite presidential guard from Kinshasa.</p>
<p>The Mai-Mai take their name from the Swahili word for water and fight in family groups armed with weapons including rifles, crossbows, slingshots, spears and home-made shotguns.</p>
<p>They believe bullets will turn to water after they have been innoculated with a secret vaccine. Tribally of Zairean Hunde and Nande origin, their main apparent motive for fighting is loot.</p>
<p>But the fragile hold the Banyamulenge have over the Mai-Mai seems to be weakening, possibly as they are taking casualties.</p>
<p>With a garland of mango leaves on his head, a 11-year-old Mai-Mai child in dirty clothes and clutching a hand grenade refused to allow traffic past him on a Beni street on Friday.</p>
<p>He ignored orders from the rebels until an officer hit him.</p>
<p>&quot;They are very difficult to deal with,&quot; said another rebel officer, noting they had fought on all sides to the conflict in eastern Zaire. &quot;All they want to do is to kill and to loot.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunia is on the main road westwards to Kisangani, Zaire's fourth largest city, which has also been heavily reinforced.</p>
