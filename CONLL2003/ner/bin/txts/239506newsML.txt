Senegal foreign minister Niasse seeks U.N. post.

DAKAR 1996-12-06

Senegal's President Abdou Diouf said on Friday he was proposing his foreign minister Moustapha Niasse for the post of United Nations secretary general.

Diouf announced the bid to reporters when he returned from the Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso where an African successor to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was discussed. The United States has vetoed a second term for the Egyptian but left the door open for another African candidate.

"If Africa does not wish to lose its turn we have to act fast," Diouf said. "Some of my brother heads of state asked me if I wouldn't nominate Moustapha Niasse. I see in him the profile of a secretary-general of the United Nations and I have given my endorsement."

Niasse, 57, is a technocrat who attended universities in Dakar and Paris. His candidacy has been mentioned along with that of about four other Africans, but he runs a high risk of a Chinese veto for Senegal's recognition of Taiwan.

China regards Taiwan as a rebel province and Diouf acknowledged the possibility of a backlash over his decision last January to establish ties with Taipei.

"I am aware of all the objections that could be made. It is left to God and the Security Council," Diouf said. "Other countries approached me and I felt I had a duty to respond to their plea."

The Organisation of African Unity which had stood behind Boutros-Ghali gave its go-ahead last week for other African candidates to enter the fray after Washington exercised a veto.

President Bill Clinton says the world body needs a new leader to reform it for the 21st century. He criticised the management style of the 75-year-old Boutros-Ghali, whose five-year term runs out at the end of this month.

The Egyptian has "suspended" his bid for reappointment.
