<p>Senegal's President Abdou Diouf said on Friday he was proposing his foreign minister Moustapha Niasse for the post of United Nations secretary general.</p>
<p>Diouf announced the bid to reporters when he returned from the Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso where an African successor to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was discussed. The United States has vetoed a second term for the Egyptian but left the door open for another African candidate.</p>
<p>&quot;If Africa does not wish to lose its turn we have to act fast,&quot; Diouf said. &quot;Some of my brother heads of state asked me if I wouldn't nominate Moustapha Niasse. I see in him the profile of a secretary-general of the United Nations and I have given my endorsement.&quot;</p>
<p>Niasse, 57, is a technocrat who attended universities in Dakar and Paris. His candidacy has been mentioned along with that of about four other Africans, but he runs a high risk of a Chinese veto for Senegal's recognition of Taiwan.</p>
<p>China regards Taiwan as a rebel province and Diouf acknowledged the possibility of a backlash over his decision last January to establish ties with Taipei.</p>
<p>&quot;I am aware of all the objections that could be made. It is left to God and the Security Council,&quot; Diouf said. &quot;Other countries approached me and I felt I had a duty to respond to their plea.&quot;</p>
<p>The Organisation of African Unity which had stood behind Boutros-Ghali gave its go-ahead last week for other African candidates to enter the fray after Washington exercised a veto.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton says the world body needs a new leader to reform it for the 21st century. He criticised the management style of the 75-year-old Boutros-Ghali, whose five-year term runs out at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The Egyptian has &quot;suspended&quot; his bid for reappointment.</p>
