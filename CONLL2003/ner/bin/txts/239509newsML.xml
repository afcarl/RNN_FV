<p>Taiwanese Foreign Minister John Chang said on Friday he would not urge Taiwanese to withdraw their investments from South Africa following its decision to cut diplomatic ties and recognise China.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a very heavy investment in South Africa...I will not encourage them to pull out. That is not my intention. I will ask them to stay here as long as possible, it's important...we want to have very strong ties in the future,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Chang attended a luncheon for about 500 Taiwanese business men and women with investments in South Africa at the Alberton Civic Centre east of Johannesburg, addressing them in Chinese on the diplomatic split between Taipei and Pretoria.</p>
<p>Speaking ahead of his formal speech, he told Reuters he hoped the South African government would give a strong sign of reassurance to Taiwanese business people in South Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;They have to find ways to keep the confidence here,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nearly 300 Taiwan businesses have operations in South Africa with total investment topping US$1.5 billion. At least 43,000 jobs are created through Taiwanese investment.</p>
<p>Asked if Taiwan's suspension of agreements and government aid was not a disproportionate response to President Nelson Mandela's announcement that South Africa would only have full diplomatic relations with Beijing from 1997, he replied:</p>
<p>&quot;I think that what we announced yesterday is very much appropriate. Now we hope that the future relationship can be arranged (in a way) which will be satisfactory to both sides.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he hoped this would take place as soon as possible, adding: &quot;We have a very strong will to maintain strong ties.&quot;</p>
<p>Referring to China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has mounted a campaign to isolate Taiwan diplomatically, Chang had a message for South Africa:</p>
<p>&quot;I sincerely hope that South Africa -- the country and government -- will not allow itself to be twisted by the arms by mainland China any longer.&quot;</p>
<p>South Africa's national air carrier, facing a suspension of its Taiwanese landing rights, said it would continue to fly direct to Taipei until official notice was issued by Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had no official notification of any cancellation of our bilateral agreement and we will at this stage continue with our twice-weekly flights to Taipei,&quot; South African Airways (SAA) spokesman Leon Els told Reuters.</p>
<p>South Africa's move was a big blow to Taiwan, which now has only 29 minor diplomatic allies. Its relations with Taiwan date back to the apartheid era.</p>
<p>Chang flew to South Africa this week hoping to save the island's relationship with Pretoria. He is due to return to Taipei on Saturday.</p>
