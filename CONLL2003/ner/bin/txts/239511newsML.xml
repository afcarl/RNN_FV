<p>Zairean rebels prepared to attack the large town of Bunia in eastern Zaire on Saturday amid calls by leaders at a Franco-African summit for negotiations to end Africa's latest civil war.</p>
<p>In a separate development, an aid agency said on Friday that more than 100,000 Rwandan refugees were trekking northwest through Zaire in a huge column.</p>
<p>&quot;We are moving towards Bunia on Saturday,&quot; said a rebel officer in the town of Beni, 140 km (85 km) southwest of Bunia.</p>
<p>&quot;The Mai-Mai are moving up now to Bunia,&quot; he added, referring to a militia group which practises witchcraft.</p>
<p>In their advance north and west since October, the ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels have been using the Mai-Mai to terrify Zairean troops into fleeing. About 150 members of the Mai-Mai were in Beni on Friday.</p>
<p>Aid sources said Bunia was still in the hands of the Zairean army which had received air-borne troop reinforcements from Kisangani, the largest city in the region. The rebels had claimed to have seized the town last Tuesday.</p>
<p>Leaders at a Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso called on regional states on Friday to halt Africa's latest civil war and open negotiations leading to an international peace conference to find a lasting solution.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac told a news conference the summit had fostered broad dialogue between the region's antagonists. The idea of an international peace conference sponsored by the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity had &quot;advanced somewhat&quot;, said Chirac.</p>
<p>The rebels say they want to topple ailing Zairean strongman Mobutu Sese Seko, who is recovering from prostate cancer in France.</p>
<p>The Alliance of Democratic Forces for Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) fighters now control much of eastern Zaire after capturing the towns of Uvira, Kamanyola, Bukavu, Goma, Butembo and Beni in victories that owe much to indiscipline in Zaire's army.</p>
<p>In Kisangani on Friday, Nicholas Louis of the medical aid agency Medecins sans Frontieres said more than 100,000 Rwandan refugees had arrived in the town of Walikale.</p>
<p>At one stage refugees flowed into Walikale, 100 km (60 miles) west of the Rwandan border, at 20 every second. &quot;It was like a tidal wave and they are still pouring in, thousands upon thousands,&quot; said Louis, who was in radio contact with towns in the area.</p>
<p>He said a vanguard of about 1,500 refugees had staggered into the town of Lubutu, 180 km (110 miles) further west from Walikale, on the road to Kisangani.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of them are very weak and they are dying on the road... The biggest cause of death is malaria,&quot; said Louis.</p>
<p>He said the refugees were clearly some of those who went missing after the rebels seized control of the area from the Zairean army.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril, the Canadian general in charge of a multinational force for eastern Zaire, said in Nairobi on Friday he would return to the rebel-held area to seek more information on the plight of refugees in the countryside.</p>
<p>The small multinational force based in Uganda has been unable to deploy in Zaire because of opposition from both the Kinshasa government and the rebels.</p>
<p>Refugee camps in eastern Zaire which were home to some 1.2 million people have broken up and more than 500,000 Rwandans have gone home. Foreign reconnaissance flights have found only a fraction of the remaining hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>In Tanzania, the government banned economic activity in camps for Rwandan Hutu refugees and restricted their movements.</p>
<p>The move came a day after the government told more than half a million refugees to go back to Rwanda by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Government officials said the ban on economic activity would first be enforced in five refugee camps in the northwest Karagwe district. The government would introduce an exclusion zone around the camps, they added.</p>
<p>Some 542,000 Rwandan Hutus fled to Tanzania in 1994 during civil war and genocide of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by Hutu troops, militiamen and mobs in Rwanda.</p>
<p>Many refugees in Tanzania refuse to go home because they fear they might be jailed or attacked in reprisal for the genocide, which some took part in.</p>
