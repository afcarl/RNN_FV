President Nelson Mandela criticised South Africa's black business leaders on Friday, saying their inefficiency was hampering his efforts to promote their cause.

Mandela, addressing business leaders in Cape Town, also accused white conglomerates of resisting foreign competition and said some South Africans were engaged in economic sabotage.

"The hostility of big business to having foreign companies come in to form joint ventures with blacks, you can cut it with a knife," he said. "It's obvious, they don't want any competition."

But Mandela said his main difficulty was the performance of black business itself, citing attempts to consult business leaders before appointing Finance Minister Trevor Manuel.

"I phone Oppenheimer and I find him," Mandela said, referring to leading mining tycoon Harry Oppenheimer. "I say I'm appointing Trevor Manuel as minister of finance, he says 'I think that's a good appointment'."

Mandela said he contacted another half-dozen white business leaders without any problem, but when he tried to telephone blacks: "The phone rings and rings and nobody answers... therefore it would appear I'm consulting only whites."

"I couldn't get a single black man. If you don't put your house in order, it's going to be difficult for us," Mandela said.

He accused an unnamed group of whites of trying to harm South Africa's cause in the United States.

"Recently there was a delegation of 10 businessmen from South Africa that went to the United States...(They) went round the banks and the financial institutions and said 'You must be mad if you want to invest in South Africa, that country has become a banana republic like the rest of Africa.'

"We know who they are and we know why they did that," Mandela said, without elaborating.

Mandela, who has declared he will not stand for office when South Africa holds its next elections in 1999, asked South Africans to let him know when he was out of line.

"If a man of 78, who is about to step down as president of the country, becomes arrogant because he leads a majority party in this country...and thinks only in terms of the ethnic group to which he belongs, please tell him in simple language: 'Go to Hell'."
