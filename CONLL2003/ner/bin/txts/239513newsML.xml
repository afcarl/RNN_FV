<p>Ghana's business community is divided over which of two main candidates in presidential elections on Saturday is more likely to quickly restore confidence in the West African nation's economy.</p>
<p>President Jerry Rawlings's re-election drive has emphasised large infrastructure projects to attract foreign investors, while the main opposition alliance under candidate John Kufuor has promised greater commitment to market liberalisation and protection for some sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a wait-and-see period of up to a year,&quot; Kelye Gazekpo, director of Ghana's leading stockbroking company Databank, told Reuters. &quot;But in the long term it would be better if Kufour wins. He stems from a genuinely private sector-orientated political tradition.&quot;</p>
<p>The alliance of Kufuor's New Patriotic Party (NPP) and Kow Arkaah's People's Convention Party (PCP) has promised relief from 10 years of economic belt-tightening.</p>
<p>A third candidate is not given much of a chance, with the poll expected to be a close contest between Rawlings and Kufuor. Parliamentary elections are being held simultaneously.</p>
<p>Supporters of Rawlings claim peace and stability have grown during the 15 years since he seized power in a coup, despite violence in the runup to polling.</p>
<p>&quot;If he wins we will not wait long with fresh investments,&quot; a foreign investor in the tourist industry told Reuters.</p>
<p>The president's National democratic Congress (NDC) has kept a populist edge stemming from strong Marxist roots but now pulls support from young business executives, the main beneficiaries of growth and economic reforms inspired by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>&quot;Rawlings is not genuinely private sector-oriented,&quot; said Gazekpo. &quot;There are still businessmen here holding their money because they do not trust Rawlings and remember all too well his populist campaign in the early 1980s against those who held a bit of wealth.&quot;</p>
<p>Opposition alliance election promises include protection for local beer and gold industries and giving priority to Ghanaian investors in privatisation programmes.</p>
<p>The alliance has also mooted more jobs, higher wages, higher purchase prices for farm produce, and better healthcare and education facilities at less cost.</p>
<p>&quot;We will introduce a gradualist liberalisation of imports and ban some foreign products. Who needs imported beer with three breweries in the country?&quot; a spokesman for the alliance said at a meeting of the Association of Ghanaian Industrialists last week.</p>
<p>&quot;We are aware of the effects of over-liberalisation of imports but instead of protection we provide assistance and support for local industry,&quot; countered deputy trade minister Dan Abodakpi at the same meeting.</p>
<p>Kufuor's party has hammered against the takeover of state-owned enterprises, notably the goldmining industry, by foreign investors.</p>
<p>&quot;Priority must be given to Ghanaians in the disposal of state enterprise, since it is their savings which created them in the first place,&quot; says the NPP's manifesto.</p>
<p>The opposition has also promised to free the Bank of Ghana from government policy after a bout of inflation followed an increase in the country's money supply in 1995.</p>
