<title>GHANA: Ghana presidential rival a seasoned politician.</title>

<p>John Agyekum Kufuor, the main challenger to Ghana's president Jerry Rawlings in presidential elections on Saturday is a seasoned politician and businessman.</p>
<p>Kufuor, who will be 58 on Sunday, is a lawyer by training who sat in parliament and served briefly as a minister under Rawlings in 1982.</p>
<p>He has few good things to say about his former boss, who was then a young military ruler.</p>
<p>&quot;The regime started committing brutalities. I wrote Rawlings that I disagreed and resigned,&quot; Kufuor told Reuters on Thursday. &quot;The murder of three magistrates was for me the main reason to resign.&quot;</p>
<p>Kufuor's father was the Oyokohene of Kumasi, the head of the clan of the powerful king of the Ashantis.</p>
<p>Educated at Oxford, England, Kufuor boasts an impressive track record in business which he holds as a his main credential for seeking to take charge and transform Ghana's economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The people of Ghana know that if anybody is going to stabilise Ghana and will make private enterprise flourish, it is Kufuor,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Right from the beginning when he took power...Rawlings has made life impossible for business people. His U-turn from Marxism to capitalism...for a long time only favoured multinationals, not the native business community,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Only two years ago Ghanaian businessmen began breathing a bit freer. But take gold mining, a major growth sector, there are hardly Ghanaian entrepreneurs involved. This government has always frightened off private initiative,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Rawlings kept calling businessmen thieves, crooks, for a long time and confiscated important companies, such as a brewery and a salt industry. The Ghanaian business community can never trust him,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the People's Convention Party (PCP), against the odds, formed an alliance in August, and chose NPP's Kufuor as a joint candidate.</p>
<p>Although there is a third candidate, surgeon Edward Mahama of the People's National Convention, most pundits agree the race is between Rawlings and Kufuor -- and it's likely to be close.</p>
<p>Kufuor's party, which won almost a third of the vote in 1992, groups the professional classes with moderate conservative tradition.</p>
<p>The PCP, which did not exist in 1992, follows the socialist line promoted by Kwame NKrumah, Ghana's first president.</p>
<p>Born on December 8, 1938, Kufuor is married to Theresa Aba Mensah, a nurse. They have five children.</p>
