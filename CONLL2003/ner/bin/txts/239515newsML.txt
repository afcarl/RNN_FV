Zaireans at loss as world abndons drifting state.

With the outside world reluctant to step in to rescue Zaire from collapse, its 40 million people are beginning to look inward for a solution to the escalating crisis triggered by the Tutsi rebellion in the east.

"The international community no longer has any interest in either preserving Zaire as a state or seeing it break up," a senior military aide to Presdient Mobutu Sese Seko told Reuters.

"We have to find a Zairean solution to our problems. What can we expect from countries such as America? America has watched even its closest African partners, such as Liberia, fall apart," he said.

Mobutu, Zaire's president for 31 years, is in southern France convalescing after cancer surgery.

His return for some remains the only hope that the country, rocked by advances of Rwandan-backed rebels who have seized large parts of eastern Zaire since October, will ride out the crisis in one piece.

"It would have a significant psychological impact on the demoralized army, and would enable key decisions to be made which Mobutu cannot make while he is away on foreign territory," a senior government official said.

But after numerous premature declarations announcing his imminent return, many Zaireans have stopped believing their all-powerful president is well enough after more than three months' treatment for cancer, to pay even a visit back home.

During his rule Mobutu, 66, has gathered almost all the state powers in his own hands, becoming in the process one of Africa's wealthiest and most absolute rulers.

But in the last six years the country has been opened up to multiparty democracy and Mobutu's constitutional powers have on paper been whittled away. The economy has continued a 20-year nosedive and with the state bankrupt, many of the provinces have become virtually autonomous.

Mobutu supporters say he has juggled the immensely complex regional and etchnic tensions of his country with guile and cunning, and against all odds has forged a national identity out of a huge mass of hostile and opposing tribes.

But even these admit a paradox in his legacy: the one man who says he holds Zaire together is also the one man who has played the most powerful part in its spectacular decline.

"How can you call the man who created the Zairean army, the one man who is holding Zaire in one piece?" one Western diplomat asked on Friday.

Zaire's army, unpaid, unfed and trained to serve the interest of a corrupt elite, has proved unable to withstand the rebel onslaught in the east.

In recent weeks town after town has fallen to the rebels, whose leader Laurent Kabila says he is fighting to overthrow Mobutu.

The combination of the rebel advance and Mobutu's illness, has put a huge question mark over Zaire's political future, which in theory was destined to be settled in the country's first multiparty elections in May next year.

Although many Zaireans would like to see the page turned on the Mobutu years, few of them know of a leader capable of reuniting the increasingly fractured state as he has.

Etienne Tshisekedi, Mobutu's main opponent in the radical opposition, is popular amongst his own Baluba ethnic group and the downtrodden inhabitants of the capital, but has many enemies.

"Tshisekedi has many supporters but Zaire needs a military man in charge if it is to hold together when Mobutu goes," an officer in the Zairean army said.

But even from within the political and military family spawned by Mobutu's own patronage system analysts say there is no obvious successor in sight.
