<p>With the outside world reluctant to step in to rescue Zaire from collapse, its 40 million people are beginning to look inward for a solution to the escalating crisis triggered by the Tutsi rebellion in the east.</p>
<p>&quot;The international community no longer has any interest in either preserving Zaire as a state or seeing it break up,&quot; a senior military aide to Presdient Mobutu Sese Seko told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to find a Zairean solution to our problems. What can we expect from countries such as America? America has watched even its closest African partners, such as Liberia, fall apart,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mobutu, Zaire's president for 31 years, is in southern France convalescing after cancer surgery.</p>
<p>His return for some remains the only hope that the country, rocked by advances of Rwandan-backed rebels who have seized large parts of eastern Zaire since October, will ride out the crisis in one piece.</p>
<p>&quot;It would have a significant psychological impact on the demoralized army, and would enable key decisions to be made which Mobutu cannot make while he is away on foreign territory,&quot; a senior government official said.</p>
<p>But after numerous premature declarations announcing his imminent return, many Zaireans have stopped believing their all-powerful president is well enough after more than three months' treatment for cancer, to pay even a visit back home.</p>
<p>During his rule Mobutu, 66, has gathered almost all the state powers in his own hands, becoming in the process one of Africa's wealthiest and most absolute rulers.</p>
<p>But in the last six years the country has been opened up to multiparty democracy and Mobutu's constitutional powers have on paper been whittled away. The economy has continued a 20-year nosedive and with the state bankrupt, many of the provinces have become virtually autonomous.</p>
<p>Mobutu supporters say he has juggled the immensely complex regional and etchnic tensions of his country with guile and cunning, and against all odds has forged a national identity out of a huge mass of hostile and opposing tribes.</p>
<p>But even these admit a paradox in his legacy: the one man who says he holds Zaire together is also the one man who has played the most powerful part in its spectacular decline.</p>
<p>&quot;How can you call the man who created the Zairean army, the one man who is holding Zaire in one piece?&quot; one Western diplomat asked on Friday.</p>
<p>Zaire's army, unpaid, unfed and trained to serve the interest of a corrupt elite, has proved unable to withstand the rebel onslaught in the east.</p>
<p>In recent weeks town after town has fallen to the rebels, whose leader Laurent Kabila says he is fighting to overthrow Mobutu.</p>
<p>The combination of the rebel advance and Mobutu's illness, has put a huge question mark over Zaire's political future, which in theory was destined to be settled in the country's first multiparty elections in May next year.</p>
<p>Although many Zaireans would like to see the page turned on the Mobutu years, few of them know of a leader capable of reuniting the increasingly fractured state as he has.</p>
<p>Etienne Tshisekedi, Mobutu's main opponent in the radical opposition, is popular amongst his own Baluba ethnic group and the downtrodden inhabitants of the capital, but has many enemies.</p>
<p>&quot;Tshisekedi has many supporters but Zaire needs a military man in charge if it is to hold together when Mobutu goes,&quot; an officer in the Zairean army said.</p>
<p>But even from within the political and military family spawned by Mobutu's own patronage system analysts say there is no obvious successor in sight.</p>
