Officials made final preparations on Friday for elections that will mark the first time an elected government in Ghana has served out its term since independence in 1957.

New trucks from the electoral commission dashed across the country delivering ballot boxes and voter lists for Saturday's presidential and legislative elections.

"Things couldn't be better," said Joe Baxter of the Washington-based International Foundation for Electoral Systems, one of the foreign agencies helping.

"The Electoral Commission is taking care of some small loose ends, like sending material to those regional directors who called up to say that they lack certain supplies, but that's all," Baxter told Reuters at the elections headquarters.

Baxter has been working with the Electoral Commission for two years. Several foreign donors helped modernise it to overcome logistics problems that have dogged recent elections in the region.

The runup to the vote has been marred by tension and some violence. A supporter of President Jerry Rawlings' National Democratic Congress (NDC) was killed last Sunday. Rawlings, a former military ruler, is seeking a second four-year term as elected leader.

It is the first time an elected leader has not been toppled in a military coup since Ghana became the first black African nation to win independence from European colonial rulers.

After elections in 1954 the ballot box was not used again in Ghana until 1969. The army first intervened in 1966 when they ousted nationalist president Kwammeh Nkrumah. Since 1957 Ghanaians have voted only five times.

Rawlings, an air force flight-lieutenant who took power in 1979, restored civilian rule only to seize power again in 1981. He is a crowd-puller but, as he admitted after a December cabinet scuffle, "not much of a diplomat".

His NDC is challenged by an alliance formed by the NPP and the People's Convention Party (PCP), with NPP's John Kufuor as a joint candidate. A third candidate, surgeon Edward Mahama of the People's National Convention, is not given much of a chance and most pundits predict a close race between Rawlings and Kufuor.

The U.S. aid agency USAID alone spent $9 million to revamp the electoral commission. Other donors included the European Union, Denmark, Germany, and China. Donations came in the form of cash or equipment ranging from computers to lanterns.

About 100 foreign monitors and 4,000 trained domestic observers will watch the polls. Most electoral material has already been moved to the 120 electoral districts, where it is being kept in police armouries, staff told Reuters.

"We have done everything that we need to do. I am confident that the elections are going to be smooth and the results accepted by everybody," Kwadwo Afari-Gyan, the commission's chairman, told Reuters.

In 1992 Rawlings returned Ghana to democratic rule and won presidential elections which observers judged free and fair. But the opposition boycotted parliamentary elections three weeks later to protest against alleged wide-spread rigging of the poll.
