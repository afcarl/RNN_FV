U.S. drugs team to assess Nigerian effort.

ABUJA 1996-12-06

U.S. anti-drug officials are to assess Nigeria's efforts to end its role as a major transit centre for narcotics, an official said on Friday.

"We welcome the fact-finding team," Adamu Mohammed, special adviser to the military government on drugs and financial crimes, told journalists.

Mohammed said the team would arrive on Monday for a four-day visit. "Afterwards, they will hopefully find out the true situation on our efforts and subsequently grade us properly and objectively," he said.

In May Nigeria rejected a U.S. report that said the populous West African nation was not doing enough against drug trafficking.

Nigeria does not produce heroin or cocaine but has a reputation as a transit centre point and many Nigerian couriers are in prison abroad.

Nigeria has been "decertified" by the United States twice since 1994, a measure to block economic aid that Washington takes when dissatisfied with a country's efforts against drugs.

Relations are also strained by U.S. criticism of Nigeria's ruling generals for alleged human rights abuses and lack of democracy.
