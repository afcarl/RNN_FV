HARARE 1996-12-06

Zimbabwean stocks ended the week mixed in active Friday trade with brokers saying they expected prices, which were knocked over the past two weeks by profit-taking, to stabilise next week ahead of the Christmas break.

"Stocks were still mixed today but prices should stabilise next week as everybody is getting ready for the Christmas holidays," one broker said.

The key 57-share industrial index edged up 2.56 points to 8,057.26. But it fell 68.22 points on the week.

Among the day's winners, publishing group Zimpapers and horticulture firm Ariston gained 50 cents to 2,050 and 1,650 respectively and sugar producer Hippo rose 40 cents to 940.

Rubber products-maker Acacia at 280, pharmaceutical group Caps at 390, battery manufacturer Chloride at 110, building firm Mash at 220 and tobacco company TSL at 620 all climbed 10 cents.

Among the losers, cement producer Porthold dropped 40 cents to 1,460, furniture and clothing retailer Tedco shed 25 cents to 700 and glass firm PG lost 20 cents to 480.

Minings were quieter in thin volumes with gold investor Falcon rising 150 cents to 1,250. The seven-counter mining index ended a marginal 1.83 points at 1,169.89 -- a drop of 44.56 points on the week.
