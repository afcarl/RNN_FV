<p>Zimbabwean stocks ended the week mixed in active Friday trade with brokers saying they expected prices, which were knocked over the past two weeks by profit-taking, to stabilise next week ahead of the Christmas break.</p>
<p>&quot;Stocks were still mixed today but prices should stabilise next week as everybody is getting ready for the Christmas holidays,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>The key 57-share industrial index edged up 2.56 points to 8,057.26. But it fell 68.22 points on the week.</p>
<p>Among the day's winners, publishing group Zimpapers and horticulture firm Ariston gained 50 cents to 2,050 and 1,650 respectively and sugar producer Hippo rose 40 cents to 940.</p>
<p>Rubber products-maker Acacia at 280, pharmaceutical group Caps at 390, battery manufacturer Chloride at 110, building firm Mash at 220 and tobacco company TSL at 620 all climbed 10 cents.</p>
<p>Among the losers, cement producer Porthold dropped 40 cents to 1,460, furniture and clothing retailer Tedco shed 25 cents to 700 and glass firm PG lost 20 cents to 480.</p>
<p>Minings were quieter in thin volumes with gold investor Falcon rising 150 cents to 1,250. The seven-counter mining index ended a marginal 1.83 points at 1,169.89 -- a drop of 44.56 points on the week.</p>
