Mobil Corp will talk with Nigerian officials next week on using gas associated with oil production to generate electricity for sale locally, a company spokesman said on Friday.

"Two officials are here from Mobil's electricity subsidiary in the United States. They will meet with the government on Monday and we hope to have an agreement early next year," Yomi Adeyemi-Wilson of Mobil's Nigeria unit told Reuters.

Adeyemi-Wilson said the plant had been proposed for the southeastern city of Port Harcourt, but he could not give an idea of the size of the project.

"A few outstanding issues are to be finalised such as the amount of payments from the Nigeria Electric Power Authority (NEPA) to the Mobil/NNPC (Nigeria National Petroleum Corp) joint venture," he said.

Around 75 percent of the gas associated with oil production in Nigeria is currently flared.

Government estimates put total reserves at between 150 and 300 trillion cubic feet.

Mobil is the second biggest oil operator in Nigeria. It currently pumps around 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude and expects to hit a target of 900,000 bpd by the year 2000.
