Ivory Coast cocoa product exports slip in October.

ABIDJAN 1996-12-06

Ivory Coast's semi-finished cocoa products and powder exports eased to 7,061 tonnes in October from 8,808 in September, official data show.

Shipments totalling 5,959 tonnes left from Abidjan, including 521 of cocoa powder, with another 1,102 tonnes routed through San Pedro, Ivory Coast's second port.

Exports were up from October 1995 when 4,107 tonnes, including 424 tonnes of powder, were shipped.

Separate figures are not given for cocoa liquor, butter and cake.

Cumulative product exports totalled 65,663 by the end of the (Oct-Sept) 1995/96 season. Powder shipments rose to 5,039 tonnes over the period.

Ivory Coast is aiming to process more cocoa beans locally in 1996/97 so semi-finished product shipments are expected to rise.

The country's overall cocoa crop is expected to drop from 1.2 million tonnes. Ivorian Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan recently put a figure of 950,000 tonnes for the entire 1996/97 season.

Exporters put the total lower but private forecasters have issued more optimistic forecasts. The 1996/97 cocoa marketing season opened on October 24 but all October shipments will be counted as 1996/97 statistics, exporters said. --Matthew Bunce, Abidjan Newsroom +225 21 90 90
