<p>The Canadian general in charge of a multinational force for eastern Zaire said on Friday he was going back to Zaire for more information about the plight of about 165,000 Rwandan refugees adrift in the countryside.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril told a news conference in Nairobi his main concern was for a large group of about 150,000 refugees living off the land in a valley about 65 km (40 miles) west of the eastern city of Goma.</p>
<p>If he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew, he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees, even against the wishes of the government in Kinshasa and the Zairean rebels who control much of eastern Zaire, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Tomorrow I'm going into Rwanda and my intention is to go across into eastern Zaire and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>General Baril saw rebel leader Laurent Kabila in Goma last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the Rwandan refugees have already gone home. The rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground, for fear it might help the Zairean army regain control of the area.</p>
<p>Kinshasa opposes airdrops, apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters.</p>
<p>Canadian Defence Minister Doug Young said on Thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't look as though they (airdrops) are going to be required in any significant way because the NGOs (non-governmental organisations) are in that area on the border between Zaire and Rwanda,&quot; Young told reporters.</p>
<p>But General Baril said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access (to the large group of refugees) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies.</p>
<p>&quot;If they can't move because they are too weak, then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means (airdrops)...It's complex, it's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary. If it is necessary, I won't hesitate to use it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked if he would disregard the objections of the Zairean government, he said: &quot;It would have to be in the last resort. It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger. Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time? And my mandate is also under Chapter Seven to operate in eastern Zaire.&quot;</p>
<p>Under Chapter Seven of the U.N. charter, the Security Council has wide powers to preserve peace and security.</p>
<p>&quot;I know their (the Zairean government's) position and I know it's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also,&quot; the general added.</p>
<p>He denied that his contacts, criticised by Kinshasa, with the Zairean rebels amounted to negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't negotiate,&quot; he said. &quot;I coordinate with those who are holding ground and that's a wise thing to do. When we don't know where the front is, we don't know what the risk is.&quot;</p>
<p>Baril said that apart from the group of 150,000, U.S. and British reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees -- one of up to 1,000 north of the town of Masisi and one of up to 8,000 on the road from Bukavu west to Kindu.</p>
<p>The Kisangani office of the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres said on Friday that more than 100,000 refugees were trekking northwest from the Goma-Bukavu area and many of them were now in the town of Walikale.</p>
<p>The general did not mention these refugees, who are on the outer limit of the strip the planes have been checking.</p>
