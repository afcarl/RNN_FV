JOHANNESBURG 1996-12-06

Crendell Investment Corp Ltd's listing was reinstated on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on Friday as part of a plan to create a new listed entertainment and communications group.

Stakeholders in the new group, Sasani Investments Ltd, said in a statement Sasani would buy a 73.08 percent stake in Crendell from Hosken Consolidated Investments for around 4.7 million rand or 20 cents per share.

In terms of the requirements of the Securities Regulations Panel, an offer of 25 cents per share would be made to the minority shareholders of Crendell.

"Crendell is to acquire, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, the business of Video Lab Group Partnership, which will form the group's core business and act as a platform for expansion into related industries, locally and internationally," the statement said.

The 90.5 million rand price tag for the Video Lab Group business would be settled by 45 million rand in cash and the issue of Crendell shares to the value of 45.5 million rand.

In order to fund the cash element, Crendell would implement a rights offer to raise 51 million rand before expenses, at an offer price of 18 cents per share. Shareholders would be offered 1,225 new shares for every 100 Crendell shares held.

Interleisure Limited and the management of both Interleisure and Video Lab, each of whom currently own 50 percent of Video Lab Group, would each hold approximately 20 percent of Sasani.
