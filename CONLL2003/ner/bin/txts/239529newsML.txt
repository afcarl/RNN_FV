Ivory Coast October coffee exports detailed.

ABIDJAN 1996-12-06

Ivory Coast's robusta coffee bean exports totalled 8,030 tonnes in October, against 18,019 in September and 6,008 in October 1995, official data show.

The decline after September reflected uncertainty over the opening of the 1996/97 season, exporters said.

Shipments totalling 4,367 tonnes left from Abidjan in October this year, with another 3,663 routed through San Pedro.

The figures show that 820 tonnes of soluble coffee were also shipped from Abidjan against 1,133 tonnes in September 1996 and 1,001 tonnes in October 1995. Soluble coffee is usually shipped from Abidjan alone.

No roasted product shipments were registered.

Ivory Coast's coffee season traditionally opens in early October but the 1996/97 season was delayed until November 14.

Exporters said farmers had hung on to stocks because of uncertainty over the 1996/97 farmgate price.

October shipments would still count as 1996/97 produce, they said.

Coffee marketing usually gets under way after the cocoa campaign tails off, but some up-country buyers were already offering low prices in what is expected to be a productive year.

Most exporters said they would not start buying until January, but others said they would begin earlier.
