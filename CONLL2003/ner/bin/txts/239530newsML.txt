Ivory Coast cocoa bean exports rise in October.

ABIDJAN 1996-12-06

Ivory Coast exported 12,969 tonnes of cocoa beans in October, the first month of the 1996/97 season, against 6,081 tonnes in September, official data showed on Friday.

Cumulative exports for the 1996/97 (October-September) season now stand at the 12,969 tonnes registered in October against 6,071 by the same time last year. Exports in 1995/96 rose to a total of 1,064,548 tonnes by the end of September.

A total of 7,941 tonnes shipped from San Pedro exceeded shipments of 5,028 tonnes from Abidjan, Ivory Coast's main port. Exporters expect two-thirds of this year's crop to leave from Abidjan.

Exports to Amsterdam of 1,598 tonnes topped the list of destinations from Abidjan but a breakdown was not available for San Pedro. No shipments from Abidjan to U.S. ports were listed.

Ivory Coast usually opens its cocoa marketing season in early October, making temporary stocking in September worthwhile for farmers if higher prices are expected. The 1996/97 season opened on October 24 with cocoa farmgate prices unchanged.

Cocoa exports in October 1995 were hit by a European freight rate dispute between shipping lines and the Caisse de Stabilisation marketing agency, making year-on comparisons difficult.

Ivory Coast's 1996/97 crop is forecast down this year, with prime minister Daniel Kablan Duncan recently putting the total 1996/97 crop at 950,000 tonnes against 1.2 million last year.
