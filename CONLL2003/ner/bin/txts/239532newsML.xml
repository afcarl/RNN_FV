<p>A resurgence of demand for shares in Nigerian brewers which has helped push the stock exchange to new highs may be short-lived, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>The all-share index closed at 6,850.2 from 6,841.43 on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to be cautious about breweries, the same has happened before when they were pushed up entirely on speculation and then declined through the year,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Nigerian Breweries closed up 50 kobo on the day at 17.50 naira on Friday and has risen 70 percent in five weeks. Guinness went up by 10 kobo to 6.90 naira.</p>
<p>Oil marketing company shares also maintained demand.</p>
<p>African Petroleum gained 50 kobo to 42.00 naira. National Oil gained 25 kobo to 44.00 naira. Unipetrol at 53.20 naira, Agip at 22.20 naira and Mobil at 46.70 naira were all 20 kobo stronger.</p>
<p>AIICO Insurance rose 20 kobo to 10.70 naira, the same as construction firm Julius Berger which finished at 8.20 naira while Union Dicon Salt climbed to 42.62 naira, a 12 kobo rise.</p>
<p>Nestle went ex-dividend on Friday, down 1.50 naira at 44.60 naira.</p>
<p>Ashaka Cement lost 15 kobo 17.95 naira as fears of reduced sales scared off buyers.</p>
<p>Conglomerates Lever Brothers and CFAO remained under pressure because dealers felt they were yet to touch the bottom in their current drift.</p>
<p>Lever Brothers ended at 21.90 naira and CFAO at 3.10 naira, both 10 kobo weaker.</p>
