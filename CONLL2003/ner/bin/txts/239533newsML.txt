South African stock market closing report.

JOHANNESBURG 1996-12-06

South African shares buckled on Friday as worries of sharp losses on Wall Street gripped the market but stocks were able to claw back from their weakest levels shortly before the close on benign U.S. jobs data.

Jitters, sparked by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve head Alan Greenspan which were interpreted by markets to mean the Dow was overheated, saw almost two percent torn off the all-share 100 index which ended at its lowest level in four months.

Shares were seen continuing weaker on Monday as expected Dow weakness was absorbed. The U.S. market opens only after the close of the local market.

Expectations of the Dow opening around 100 points weaker pummelled the South African equity futures market, aggravating share weakness as derivative losses spilled into the spot market.

"With the weakness we have seen across world markets, the Dow could easily lose three percent...There has been some heavy selling here of industrials, but it's not complete panic," one dealer said.

Markets across Europe on Friday experienced big falls on Greenspan's comments, seen to point to a hike in U.S. interest rates in the near term.

Speaking on Thursday Greenspan said the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets because they could end up damaging the economy.

The Dow has gained some 25 percent in value this year.

Dealers said the South African market got some small relief following the release of key U.S. unemployment figures for November which did not show any signs of inflation and was expected to relieve fears the Fed could raise rates.

"We saw a bit of a recovery on the indis (industrial futures) soon after the jobs data," a futures dealer said, adding that the industrial contract was down over 300 points at one stage.

Jobs relief and a small retracement on the futures market helped the industrial index end off its weakest. It finished down 181.5 points at 7,795.2, a fall of 2.3 percent, depressing the overall index 116.4 points to 6,601.2 -- its lowest close since August 26.

December industrial futures contracts ended over 200 points weaker at 7,442/60 from 7,680.

Amongst stocks De Beers lost 275 cents to 138 rand, SA Breweries fell 200 cents to 114 rand and Standard Bank plunged 700 cents to 163 rand.

South African gold stocks climbed on Friday tracking bullion which advanced as speculators anticipated a possible move into bullion if Greenspan's comments unnerved Wall Street.

But they came off their best levels in the afternoon as nervous sentiment overhung the entire market.

The index finished 17.5 points firmer at 1,528.0. Amongst stocks Vaal Reefs lifted 200 cents to 326 rand, Kloof added 95 cents to 37.25 rand and Freegold put on 40 cents to 35.15 rand.

The near-month gold futures contract was little changed at 1,060/65 from 1,059.
