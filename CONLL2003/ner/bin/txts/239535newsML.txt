DAR ES SALAAM 1996-12-06

The Tanzanian shilling fell against the dollar on Friday and regained some ground against the pound, the central bank said.

The shilling exchanged at a commercial mean rate of 595.6038 compared to Thursday's 594.5742. Against the pound, the shilling exchanged for 977.0910 compared to 978.9694 on Thursday.

Last Friday, the shilling ended the week slightly down on the dollar but still trading at an average mid-rate in the 594-shilling band. The marginal depreciation was of no concern to the market, with dealers saying they regarded the shilling as relatively stable.

Dealers said they were not concerned about this week's slight depreciation, which was attributed to the selling of dollars by the state-owned National Bank of Commerce (NBC).

"The NBC has more than 60 percent of the market share. Every inflow is through them. We're expecting the shilling to strengthen before the year's end," said one dealer.

He said disbursement of the first installments of the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) would also boost the shilling's value.
