<title>TANZANIA: Tanzanian shilling down on dlr, recovers on pound.</title>
<headline>Tanzanian shilling down on dlr, recovers on pound.</headline>

<text>
<p>The Tanzanian shilling fell against the dollar on Friday and regained some ground against the pound, the central bank said.</p>
<p>The shilling exchanged at a commercial mean rate of 595.6038 compared to Thursday's 594.5742. Against the pound, the shilling exchanged for 977.0910 compared to 978.9694 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Last Friday, the shilling ended the week slightly down on the dollar but still trading at an average mid-rate in the 594-shilling band. The marginal depreciation was of no concern to the market, with dealers saying they regarded the shilling as relatively stable.</p>
<p>Dealers said they were not concerned about this week's slight depreciation, which was attributed to the selling of dollars by the state-owned National Bank of Commerce (NBC).</p>
<p>&quot;The NBC has more than 60 percent of the market share. Every inflow is through them. We're expecting the shilling to strengthen before the year's end,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>He said disbursement of the first installments of the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) would also boost the shilling's value.</p>
