French President Jacques Chirac on Friday reassured France's former African colonies that their CFA currency, linked to the French franc, would not suffer from the creation of the single European currency in 1999.

He told a news confernce at the end of a Franco-African summit in Ouagadougou that suggestions of possible changes in the parity of the CFA franc were unfounded.

"I have told the heads of the states in the franc zone that the single European currency will not entail any consequences of any kind for the franc zone," he said.

On the contrary, CFA countries would benefit from the proposed Euro currency, Chirac said.

"They will be linked in parity through the French franc to a strong international currency and will get the advantage of stability," he said.

Chirac said he would give detailed explanation in writing in personal letters to the leaders of every CFA country.

Chirac said that article 109 of the Maastricht Treaty creating the European Monetary Union allowed special links between currencies to remain after the Euro currency comes into effect.

The CFA franc links the currencies of 14 African countries with the franc, and the proposed European currency had raised concern of a new blow following a massive 50 percent devaluation in 1994, the first change in parity since 1948.

The devaluation forced many governments to adopt economic rigour to avoid worsening poverty.

The current parity is 100 CFA francs for one French franc.
