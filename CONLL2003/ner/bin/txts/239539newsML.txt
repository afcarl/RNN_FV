Supermarket chain in big demand on Nairobi bourse.

NAIROBI 1996-12-06

Foreign investors bought 3.2 million shares of Uchumi Supermarket chain on Friday, the second largest deal transacted at the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) this year, bourse officials said.

Turnover was posted at 153.411 million shillings traded on 3,484,582 million shares from 9.140 million shillings traded 209,153 shares on Thursday. The index went up 3.71 points to stand at 3056.40.

For the last two months, the spotlight has been on the Foreign Investors Board (FIB) with prices on key shares being supported by foreign demand.

Brokers and bourse officials said that the interest from foreigners in the market was encouraging because it helped portray a positive image for the emerging market.

"In fact, if they can be allowed to buy up to 50 percent of our local companies, then I am sure that they would be able to propel the market in the right direction," a bourse official said.

Currently, foreign investors are only allowed up to 40 percent shareholding.

Elsewhere, Barclays Bank traded at 98 from 97, while Kenya Commercial Bank gained 50 cents to close at 66.

Trading in the Agriculturals was low with Rea Vipingo trading 11,555 shares at 10.50 unchanged.

Some 132,000 shares of Firestone East Africa were traded on the FIB at between 28.50 and 30.

Prices are expected to pick up early next year, with many companies making their year-end announcements any time this year.

"In fact, I expect the market to be in high gear in January and February since that is when the market indicators -- mainly financial institutions will announce their results," a senior broker said.
