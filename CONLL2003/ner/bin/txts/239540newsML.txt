Thousands flee fighting in southwestern Uganda.

Thousands of people fled villages and hamlets in Uganda's Ruwenzori mountains on Friday as Ugandan troops fought rebels pushed out of bases in eastern Zaire.

Ugandan soldiers said the rebels were looting, raping women and torching fields in the Ruwenzori mountains, the famed "Mountains of the Moon" straddling southwestern Uganda's border with Zaire.

"They crossed over in numbers but we have got them on the run," said a Ugandan soldier at Bwera, a small border town.

A steady stream of people emerged from the countryside loaded with mattresses and bundles of belongings and took to the road from Bwera to Kasese, a provincial centre 50 km (30 miles) away.

"There has been a lot of fighting in the hills," said a woman. "Last night, again this morning. It is not safe."

Soldiers in Bwera told Reuters about 800 rebels of the Moslem Allied Democratic Force had crossed into Uganda from eastern Zaire on Tuesday and attacked the border town.

Dozens of homes were gutted and bullet cases littered the street. Ugandan troops on Friday were in force in the town and manned a checkpoint guarded by a tank and patrolled the road linking Uganda to Zaire.

The soldiers said Zairean Banyamulenge rebels flushed the Ugandan rebels out of Zaire in their offensive since October.

They said the Ugandan rebels had been crossing into Uganda for about five years to mount attacks and loot villages.

Soldiers in Bwera said Zairean government forces still held the Zairean town of Kasindi, 10 km (six miles) west of the border with Uganda but they expected it to fall soon to Zairean rebels. They refused to allow journalists to cross the border.

But Ugandan troops were clearly in control of Kasindi on Thursday despite the Ugandan army saying all its troops had returned home following a brief incursion three km (two miles) into Zaire last week.

A Ugandan commander in Kasindi told Reuters his troops would leave on Saturday because the Ugandan rebels had been crushed.

Villagers on the road in Uganda on Friday said the rebels apparently had no clear strategy. "They are just running, but they shoot anyone they see," said a woman. "All night there was shooting."

Many of the displaced said they were heading for friends or relatives in Kasese for shelter until the fighting ended. Troops said they had killed dozens of rebels and captured about 30.

Zaire accuses Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda of sending troops to fight alongside the Zairean rebels who have seized a front 550 km (340 miles) long running north-south parallel to Zaire's eastern border.

The Ugandan government recognises Kinshasa has lost control of much of eastern Zaire to the rebels and has blamed Sudanese Islamist leader Hassan al-Turabi for anti-Ugandan rebel attacks.
