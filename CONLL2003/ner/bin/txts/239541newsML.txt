A panel was set up in the Nigerian capital on Friday to investigate the crash of a Boeing 727 in a lagoon in November, killing all 142 people on board.

The 14-member panel of aviation experts has two months to deliver a report on the causes.

"Detractors of this country can use the opportunity of the accident to call into question the safety of the Nigeria air space," said Fidelis Kaigama of the Aviation Ministry, who inaugurated the panel. "Government is therefore very concerned about the rate at which this nation has witnessed three major air crashes this year alone."

Africa's most populous nation has a poor air safety record and the crash has caused added anxiety among the travelling public.

The military government last week lifted the ban on the Aviation Development Company airline which owned the plane, but it has yet to resume flights.
