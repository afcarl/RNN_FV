<title>SOUTH AFRICA: FORECAST - Premier interim shr seen rising.</title>
<headline>FORECAST - Premier interim shr seen rising.</headline>

<p>Premier Group Ltd's interim earnings were seen rising on the back of a reduction in its interest bill and better performance from subsidiaries, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Their results should be better on the reduction of the interest bill due to the rights issue and rationalisation,&quot; said an analyst who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>She said that the Prempharm buyout by Adcock Ingram Ltd would also help boost Premier's earnings.</p>
<p>Analysts forecast earnings per share for the six months ended October ranging between 15.0 cents and 16.2 cents, with consensus at 15.6 cents. Premier's previous interim earnings per share was 12.0 cents.</p>
<p>Analysts ranged the half-year dividend between 4.8 and 5.4 cents, with consensus at 5.1 cents and compared to 4.0 cents previously.</p>
<p>Local rating agency Republic Ratings in November upgraded Premier's long term domestic rating to A+ from an A, defined as an organisation with a strong capacity to honour its debt obligations in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>&quot;Due to a combination of asset disposals, improved internal cash flows and a rights issue, core borrowings of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries have reduced to around 270 million rand from 1.35 billion rand at the April 1995 year end,&quot; the agency said at the time.</p>
<p>Analysts said subsidiaries including Bonnita Holdings Ltd and Metro Cash and Carry Ltd had already posted good results and these would lift Premier.</p>
<p>The change in management, when Gordin Utian resigned as chairman and chief executive of Premier Foods and Ian Heron assumed the post of chief executive, had been positive for the company, analysts said.</p>
