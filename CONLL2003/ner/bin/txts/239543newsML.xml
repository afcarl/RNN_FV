<title>ZAIRE: European miners held for three days in east Zaire.</title>
<headline>European miners held for three days in east Zaire.</headline>

<p>Two Belgian and one French employees at a mine in eastern Zaire were held hostage for three days by Burundian rebels, one of the three said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;About 20 Burundian rebels encircled us and took us away in a truck. They were desperate men with nothing to lose. They said they were going to kill us,&quot; said Sylvain Bogaertss, the Belgian director of works at the Sominki gold mine in Kamitoga town.</p>
<p>The three hostages were held by the lightly armed Burundian Hutus in the bush outside Kamitoga, and were fed the regional staple, fufu for the duration of their captivity.</p>
<p>They were freed separately after a large but undisclosed ransom was negotiated with the Hutu rebels and paid a week ago.</p>
<p>Kamitoga is a gold mining town situated about 80 km (50 miles) south west of the provincial capital of Bukavu. British mining entrepeneur Algie Clough owns concessions in the mines.</p>
<p>Bogaertss told Reuters that Banyamulenge Tutsis battling the Zaire army took the town last weekend shortly after he and the other two hostages were released.</p>
<p>Zairean soldiers looted the town and fled a week earlier following foreign radio broadcasts of Banyamulenge claims that they had already reached the town, Bogaertss said.</p>
<p>He said about 20 Tutsis living in Kamitoga were hunted down and killed before it was taken by the Rwanda-backed rebels.</p>
<p>Burundian Hutu rebel groups have been driven from bases inside Zaire in areas bordering Burundi, by the largely Tutsi rebel advances in the east of the country.</p>
<p>Their supply lines from Bukavu to the Rusizi plain, which served them for the best part of a two-year guerrilla war with the Tutsi army in Burundi, have been cut. Like their armed Hutu counterparts from Rwanda, many have now been driven into the interior of Zaire.</p>
<p>Bogaertss and other staff from the Sominki mine flew into the Zairean capital on Thursday on a regular flight from the eastern Zaire town of Kindu.</p>
<p>Rwandan-backed rebels claim to have taken Kindu two days ago but Bogaertss said it was still in Zaire army hands.</p>
<p>Kindu is around 500 km (310 miles) further west of Kamitoga. The two towns are separated by vast expanses of dense tropical forest and mountains, served by one rutted mud road with log bridges, some of which Bogaertss said have been destroyed by the retreating Zairean army.</p>
