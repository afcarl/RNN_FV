Ruling party dominates parliament in Comoros.

MORONI, Comoro Islands 1996-12-06

The ruling National Rally for Development in the Comoro Islands took 32 of 37 seats in a federal assembly in last Sunday's election, officials said on Friday.

The remaining six seats in the 43-member assembly will be decided in a second round of voting on Sunday.

The Constitutional Commission said the National Rally for Development took 32 seats, independent candidates took three seats and the Islamist National Front for Justice won two seats.

The main opposition alliance, the Forum for National Recovery, boycotted the vote in the former French colony, saying it wanted elections for a constituent assembly, a revision of electoral registers and a new independent electoral commission.

The second round on Sunday in this Indian Ocean archipelago will be a contest between the top two candidates in cases where no candidate won an absolute majority in the first round last Sunday.
