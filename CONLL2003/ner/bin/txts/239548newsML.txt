France limits troops role in Central Africa mutiny.

OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso 1996-12-06

French President Jacques Chirac said on Friday that French troops in Central African Republic would not go beyond protecting foreigners and preventing major violence in the current army mutiny.

"France cannot be involved in the domestic political debate," Chirac told a news conference at the end of a Franco-African summit in the Burkina Faso capital Ouagadougou.

"French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities," he said.

Chirac said Paris was against violent opposition to Bangui's elected government. But his statement confirmed France's more low-key approach to the Central African country's third army mutiny this year.

French troops openly propped up elected President Ange-Felix Patasse on previous occasions. They only opened fire this time when rebels attacked a central Bangui hotel on Thursday.

Chirac said Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore would visit Bangui "in the coming hours" with the heads of state of Gabon, Mali and Chad to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels.

Compaore said the fighting in Bangui appeared to be part of a struggle for power, and his trip there would be a fact-finding mission to try to prevent trouble from spreading and suggest peaceful solutions.

"If an incident is not brought under control rapidly, it can put a whole region on fire," he told the joint news conference.

"Our ambition is to be there to listen, make suggestions and proposals," he said.
