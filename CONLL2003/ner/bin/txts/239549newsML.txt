South African shares are seen bracing for a steady drop next week tracking Wall Street which is expected to take a pounding on comments from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, fund managers and dealers said on Friday.

Stocks on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) on Friday began a sharp slide, which was seen extending into next week, after comments Thursday from Greenspan were interpreted to mean U.S. markets were overheated.

Although South African equities have paid little attention to the Dow's movements in recent weeks, commentators said an already shaky JSE, buffeted by an ailing rand and bullion, would not be able to shrug off severe weakness on world markets.

"Everyone will be watching Wall Street very closely," said Andre Joubert, a portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management.

"If Wall Street had gone up only 10 percent this year no one would be worried, but given it has had this unprecedented run a lot of people are saying it has gone too far."

Although stopping short of commenting directly on Wall Street's strong run, Greenspan said the Federal Reserve had to be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets as that could end up doing damage to the economy.

After a fairly steady week, South African shares on Friday dived over one percent. At 1220 GMT the overall index was 1.6 percent or 108.6 points weaker at 6,609.0 -- its lowest level in nearly four months.

But the flipside of the gloom on industrial shares was some optimism on gold shares as bullion rose off recent three-year lows.

"Our gold shares have been oversold lately. We may well see the gold index rising quite nicely next week and possibly the mining financials as well," said Denzil Newman, a portfolio manager at Syfrets Managed Assets.

Bullion on Friday advanced sharply as speculators anticipated a possible move into bullion if Greenspan's comments unnerved Wall Street.

The JSE gold index on Friday leaped over two percent after stocks had started the week at 11-month lows.

Market observers said industrial stocks could come under further pressure as fund managers, ahead of the end of the fourth quarter, tried to dump underperforming shares in a bid to boost their portfolios' showing.

Concerns over Taiwan's suspension of aid projects and treaties, after South Africa said it would stop recognising Taipei in favour of Beijing, would also weigh on shares.

"Moral views aside, it (the cutting off of Taiwan ties) leaves a bad taste in people's mouths...We need as many political friends as we can have," Joubert said.

Arbitrage trading between the equity futures and spot markets ahead of the near-month futures expiry on December 17 was seen adding an element of uncertainty to shares' direction. Shares will receive little direction from economic indicators next week with no major figures due for release. As year-end approaches, corporate results are also slowing with only two sets of major companies reporting.

New Africa Investments Ltd, the black empowerment company which headed the consortium that recently won control of Johnnies Industrial Corp Ltd, is due to report year earnings on Tuesday.

The Premier Group, a diversified industrial holding company, is scheduled to release year results on Wednesday.
