<p>South African chemical companies are still willing to discuss proposals for a petrochemical plant with Taiwanese interests, Central Energy Fund spokesman Howard Roberts said on Friday.</p>
<p>Commenting on reports that plans for the project had been cancelled, Roberts said he had not heard from the Taiwanese since their government suspended aid projects and 36 treaties over South Africa's diplomatic switch to Beijing. &quot;We have not heard anything from these folk,&quot; Roberts told Reuters.</p>
<p>Although state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp officials were on Friday quoted as saying the $3.5 billion project planned with industrial conglomerate Tuntex and Kuangh-Hwa Investment Holding Co had been cancelled, it has not even reached feasibility study stage.</p>
<p>CEF has been co-ordinating negotiations with the Taiwanese on behalf of a consortium of local chemical companies consisting of Sentrachem, Polyfin, AECI Ltd, Sasol Ltd and Hoechst South Africa Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;What they are proposing has a lot of merit and we will see what they say,&quot; Roberts said.</p>
<p>The viability of the plant still had to be determined by a feasibility study. The Taiwanese had suggested that it should include a refinery, an aromatics plant and all the downstream petrochemicals activities associated with aromatics production.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an idea worth pursuing but we need to go through a vigorous feasibility study before coming to firm conclusions,&quot; Roberts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have put questions of clarification to them. We have had some responses. There are some questions outstanding and we will wait for their response.</p>
<p>&quot;Our interaction with Taiwan is not on hold as far as we are concerned. We will continue until they formally put a stop to it,&quot; Roberts said.</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of scepticism in the market about the proposed plant, with observers saying it had been &quot;dangled as a carrot&quot; to stop South Africa recognising Beijing over Taipei.</p>
