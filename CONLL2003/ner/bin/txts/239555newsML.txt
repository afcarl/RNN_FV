Eritrean businessmen leave for United States.

ASMARA 1996-12-06

An Eritrean business delegation left Asmara on Friday for talks in the United States with potential investors and Eritrean communities in exile, officials said.

A big government delegation, including President Isaias Afewerki, four ministers and the head of the privatisation agency, will follow the businessmen on Sunday, they said.

The businessmen's trip is sponsored by the Corporate Council for Africa, a U.S. foundation working to promote American business in Africa. The council brought businessmen from big U.S. companies to Eritrea in May.

The businessmen include Tuolde Tesfamariam, manager of the company which will build Eritrea's first five-star hotel, Yemane Tesfay from the Commercial Bank of Eritrea and Tewelde Kelati from Eritrean Shipping Lines.

Trade and Industry Minister Oqbe Abraha, included in the official delegation, said he wanted to contact Eritrean expatriates to encouarage them to invest in Eritrea.

"We are interested in meeting Eritreans in the United States to see if there is any interest in our privatisation process. It is an important part of our trip," he told Reuters.

Eritrea plans to privatise 37 state industrial firms.
