Kenya shilling up as exporters bring in dollars.

NAIROBI 1996-12-06

Flows into Kenya of hard currencies from exporters helped the shilling rise slightly against the dollar on Friday, commercial bank dealers said.

The Central Bank of Kenya posted a mean shilling rate of 55.32 against the dollar from 55.34 on Thursday. Against sterling, the shilling was posted at 90.79 from 91.04.

Dealers said coffee and tea exporters were bringing dollars into the country. "Even the central bank's intervention on Thursday afternoon did not help the dollar. The shilling resisted and continued its rally against the dollar," one said.

The shilling has traded for the last three days within a band of 55.30/40 to the dollar.

"It looks like the holiday mood is creeping in, so we do not really expect to see an active market," one dealer said.
