Nigeria plans lower port fees to compete - paper.

LAGOS 1996-12-06

Nigeria's military government plans to lower port charges in 1997 to stop trade being diverted to neighbouring countries, a local newspaper said on Friday.

The independent Thisday newspaper said the decision to reduce charges had been discussed with port operators and users and would be announced in the 1997 budget, due on January 1.

Other West African ports, most significantly in Benin, have benefited from the high cost of using Nigerian ports.

Users complain that the high cost is a result of complicated paperwork as well as direct charges.

Government attempts to clean up the ports and increase customs revenues earlier this year resulted in long delays in clearing goods as the new procedures were imposed.
