NAIROBI 1996-12-06

The yield on Kenyan 91-day treasury bills continued at this week's auction its downtrend, which started at the beginning of October, the Central Bank of Kenya said on Friday.

The central bank said it accepted bids at an average interest rate of 21.361 percent on 91-day bills, the main category, down 0.328 percent from last week. The 28-day bills had an average yield of 15.751 percent, up marginally from 15.629 percent last week.

Economists said that at 21-22 percent, the interest rate on the treasury bills was still high.

Applicants had bid for bills worth 4.889 billion shillings ($87 million), and the central bank accepted bids worth 4.088 billion. It had invited bids for bills worth 8.000 billion shillings.

The bank said it accepted 38.25 million shillings for the 28-day bills. On the 91-day bills, it accepted some 4.044 billion shillings.

In 128-day bills, the central bank accepted 6.000 million shillings at 19.999 percent. Out of these, some 5.60 million shillings were competitive bids, the first after a month of non-competitive bidding.

Treasury bill auctions are held late on Thursdays. Bank officials said that with the liberalisation of exchange rates, the bank does not specify the different categories of investors as the offer is open to both locals and foreigners.

The bank is looking to issue bonds in the secondary market early next year. These will have a floating rate, with the 91-day treasury bill average interest rate used as a base, and have a premium.
