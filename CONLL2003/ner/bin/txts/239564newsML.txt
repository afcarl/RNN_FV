Regent, Standard launch Africa asset fund.

JOHANNESBURG 1996-12-06

Regent Pacific Corporate Finance Ltd and Standard Bank London Ltd announced on Friday the launch of a fund aimed at investing in undervalued opportunities in Africa.

The portfolio was expected to have a direct exposure to South Africa of about 16 percent, which fund director Julian Mayo said was lower than the country's current weighting by market capitalisation which stood at around 84 percent.

"We think there is much better value in other markets such as Kenya, Botswana and Egypt," he said.

The Regent Undervalued Assets Africa Fund would be listed in Dublin and on the Nairobi and Botswana stock exchanges.

Regent Fund Management (U.K.) Ltd would be the investment manager, while Standard Bank London -- the international merchant banking arm of Standard Bank Investment Corp -- and Regent Pacific would be the joint placing agents of the fund.

Regent is an emerging markets fund manager with about $2 billion under management.

The fund would be aimed at institutional and professional investors.
