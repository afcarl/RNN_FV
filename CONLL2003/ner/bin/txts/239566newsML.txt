Mauritius rupee strengthens against dollar, pound. [CORRECTED 12:20 GMT]

PORT LOUIS 1996-12-06

The Mauritian rupee strengthened against the dollar and sterling on Friday in line with international trends, commercial banks foreign exchange dealers said.

The rupee was fixed at a mean commercial rate of 19.9735 to the dollar from 20.1015 on Thursday. The rupee was quoted at a mean rate of 32.7770 versus the pound from 33.1055 on Thursday.

Forex dealers said the stronger rupee on Friday reflected the weaker dollar in overnight international markets.

"Commercial banks are long in their foreign exchange reserves and the rupee's fixings at the moment are principally influenced by international trends," one dealer said.

He added the long positions in banks arose from regular central bank interventions in the interbank forex market.

The central bank said it sold $1.45 million to banks this week during two interventions on Tuesday (Corrects from Monday) and Wednesday.

Both intervention rates were lower than the prevailing interbank rate, dealers added.

"The lower intervention rates gave support to the rupee and this was an extra appreciating factor for the local currency against the dollar during the past week," one dealer said.  

An increased supply of foreign currency to commercial banks was seen on Friday with a tender sale of sterling from the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate.

Since last August, the syndicate sells 25 percent of the island's sugar export proceeds directly to banks and the remaining 75 percent is kept by the central bank for market intervention.

Sugar is the largest hard currency earner for Mauritius in net value added terms ahead of textiles export and tourism.
