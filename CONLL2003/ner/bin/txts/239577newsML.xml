<p>More than 50 people were killed in northwestern Kenya when Samburu and Pokot tribesmen armed with rifles attacked Turkana settlements on Tuesday, police were quoted on Friday as saying.</p>
<p>Nairobi's Daily Nation newspaper quoted a police spokesman as saying tribal cattle rustlers attacked Turkana camps and fought with guards before being repulsed.</p>
<p>He said the dead included an assistant chief, 40 Turkana men, women and children, eight Pokot raiders and two Samburu.</p>
<p>A total of 14 suspected raiders were arrested by police.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the raiders blocked the road to Marti division in Samburu district on Wednesday in an attempt to stop security forces from rescuing Turkana families but were later repulsed.</p>
<p>In December last year 44 people were killed in a cattle rustling raid by Pokot on Turkana homesteads in the northwest.</p>
