Differences over Zaire mar Franco-African summit.

Delegates at a Franco-African summit worked into the night on a final statement calling for an international conference to settle conflicts in central Africa's Great Lakes region, conference sources said on Friday.

They said Rwanda had objected to a draft statement calling for the deployment of a multinational force agreed by the United Nations to help get food to refugees fleeing fighting after Rwanda-backed rebels took over the Kivu region of east Zaire.

Rwanda opposes the force as it says most of the refugees have returned home to Rwanda.

Eritrea and Ethiopia objected to unspecified aspects of the statement, which called for an international peace conference to achieve a stability pact in the Great Lakes region.

Foreign ministers at the 46-nation conference, also attended by Zaire, Burundi and Uganda which are involved in the region's turmoil, were trying to iron out differences.

The summit is to end on Friday with a joint news conference by French President Jacques Chirac and host Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore.

The draft resolution also called on Burundi's neighbours to consider hardship to civilians and ease the embargo they imposed on Bujumbura after a coup in July.

Work was continuing on a separate final statement on "good governance", the main theme of the 19th Franco-African summit.

The statement summed up speeches during the opening session in which Chirac urged African countries to ensure peace and democracy as a condition for continued aid from donor countries faced with austerity policies at home.

Chirac said France would continue being Africa's champion among donor countries and international institutions, but aid would go only to countries espousing democracy, social justice and economic rigour.

"The world's future will not be achieved without Africa," he said in a dinner toast.

French sources quoted him as bluntly telling a working session earlier that relations between the international community and developing countries were based on a contract and the times of wasting aid were over.

Donors had the will to help countries undertaking economic reforms and respecting open government and social justice. But aid could only dry up if assisted countries failed to justify how aid was being used, or flouted constitutional order.

Host President Blaise Compaore, who chose "good governance" as the theme for the summit, called it a chance for Africa. But he warned rich countries to keep their side of the deal and boost aid or face the shockwaves from an impoverished continent plunged into conflict.

"If Africa remains marginalised from development, it will be a bomb whose blast will be felt beyond the oceans," he said.

The summit also gave prominence to proposals for an African peacekeeping force to prevent the continent's conflicts.

Togo's leader Gnassingbe Eyadema stressed the urgent need for an African peacekeeping force, but said Africa alone could not afford it and would need financing from outside.

"Africa is resolutely taking its destinies into its own hands...France supports this evolution," Chirac said, pledging support from the EU's Western European Union (WEU) defence body.

A pre-summit meeting of French-speaking leaders on Wednesday briefly evoked the plans to jointly train military units from various African countries to form a non-permanent force that could go into action rapidly on orders from the United Nations or the Organisation of African Unity.
