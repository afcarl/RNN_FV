<p>Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic came under fresh pressure on Friday from Western powers to recognise an opposition victory in local polls.</p>
<p>A U.S. State Department spokesman said Serbia needed to open a dialogue with the Zajedno (Together) opposition after 19 days of street demonstrations against vote-rigging in local elections.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States believes that the Serbian government should now go a further step...should initiate an open dialogue with the opposition in Serbia,&quot; spokesman Nichols Burns said.</p>
<p>Washington said it was not sufficient for Serbia &quot;to think about&quot; reversing a decision to annul the opposition victory in Belgrade.</p>
<p>&quot;This is no time for business as usual on Serbia. This is a time for the democratic process to move forward in Serbia,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The strong words from Washington followed a decision by the European Union to refuse Belgrade preferential trade terms granted to its Balkan neighbours.</p>
<p>&quot;Somebody who undermines the will of the people will have a hard time finding the road to Europe,&quot; German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told reporters in Brussels.</p>
<p>The United States and European states were slow to react when the opposition demonstrations began after the November 17 local elections.</p>
<p>But despite Milosevic's central role in the U.S.-brokered Bosnia peace agreement, Washington and its allies have adopted an increasingly tough line and warned Belgrade against using force to put down the protests.</p>
<p>Friday's demonstration in the capital resembled a victory carnival as opposition supporters grew confident they had gained the upper hand in a campaign to overturn poll fraud.</p>
<p>Almost 150,000 protesters thronged the city centre after lawyers for the Zajedno coalition submitted papers to the supreme court, which was expected to decide on the outcome of Belgrade local elections.</p>
<p>The supreme court was reviewing a decision to annul a landmark victory for the opposition in the capital in run-off local polls held on November 17.</p>
<p>Amid signs that Milosevic was ceding ground, a Zajedno legal spokesman cautioned: &quot;I am not prepared to forecast the outcome.&quot;</p>
<p>The judges can decide whether Zajedno won control of Belgrade or order a review of the result by a lower court which earlier ruled in the socialists' favour.</p>
<p>The mood on the streets was euphoric as the conviction grew that the sustained protests have inflicted severe damage on the autocratic Milosevic.</p>
<p>In front of the state television building -- a symbol of Milosevic's authoritarian rule -- demonstrators lit hundreds of candles and crossed themselves, saying they were &quot;mourning the death of truth&quot;.</p>
<p>Socialist sources fuelled speculation that Milosevic would surrender Belgrade and possibly the southern town of Nis to end protests that are threatening to paralyse his government.</p>
<p>Zajedno leader Zoran Djindjic told demonstrators the opposition's aim was still to oust Milosevic.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not concealing our main aim -- to remove Slobodan Milosevic from power,&quot; he said. &quot;But we want to do this in a fair way, in a fair political struggle, and the first step is the recognition of the election results.&quot;</p>
<p>Zajedno spokesman Slobodan Vuksanovic denied that the opposition was bargaining with Milosevic over a compromise. &quot;The socialists must admit their defeat in Belgrade, Nis and Kraljevo,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The election-rigging charge dealt a fresh blow to Serbia's international standing, threatening its chances of an early return to the International Monetary Fund and a revival of trade with western Europe.</p>
<p>A poll in the bi-monthly NIN magazine showed Milosevic was suffering politically with a fall in his public support from 26 to 16.5 percent since the demonstrations began.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the elections, the socialists admitted they lost in Belgrade before changing their minds and persuading the municipal court to overturn the result.</p>
<p>Zajedno claims it also won in Nis, Serbia's second city, as well as other towns.</p>
<p>International condemnation, led by the United States, forced Milosevic to restore broadcasts by Belgrade's main independent radio station B-92 after shutting down its transmitter on Tuesday to halt live reports of street marches.</p>
