Russia's Primakov sees Albright as good partner.

Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said on Friday Madeleine Albright would make a "good partner for dialogue" as U.S. Secretary of State, but independent policy experts said Moscow was wary of her.

U.S. President Bill Clinton nominated Albright on Thursday to replace Warren Christopher.

Interfax news agency said Primakov had told Russian reporters that Albright was a "good professional, a person who defends her convictions firmly and sometimes toughly".

He also said Albright, currently U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, had cooperated well with Sergei Lavrov, the Russian ambassador at the U.N.

But independent foreign policy experts in Moscow said Russian officials were privately cautious about the nomination of Albright, who is widely perceived here as a tougher exponent of U.S. policy than Christopher.

"Her style will probably be tougher than her predecessor in dealings with her Russian counterpart," Andrei Piontkowski, head of Moscow's independent Centre for Strategic Studies, said.

"From the Russian point of view, I think Mr Primakov may have more problems with her."

Relations between the United States and Russia enjoyed a brief period of euphoria after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 but they have been strained by differences since then, particularly over NATO's plans to expand eastwards.

Albright has taken a firm stance in support of NATO enlargement to take in countries of eastern and central Europe which used to be members of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. Russia says such moves would threaten its security.

First Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Moscow was ready for "active and constructive" work with Albright, but he was careful to point out that Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin would shape policy when they meet for a summit in March.

Yeltsin sometimes refers to Clinton as "my friend Bill" and their personal ties have helped prevent U.S.-Russian relations becoming considerably worse. This made Clinton's re-election more important to Moscow than who became Secretary of State.

Some Russian analysts recalled that Washington was also wary of Primakov, a former spy chief, when he was appointed but soon grew to respect him.

Even so, Moscow regarded Christopher as a sound partner and any change would be unsettling at a time when ties with Washington could come under severe strain.

NATO is expected to issue formal invitations to new members next year, a move which will complicate U.S.-Russian relations.

"I don't think Albright's appointment will raise too many eyebrows but any change is looked on with concern," said Andrei Kortunov, head of the Russian Science Foundation thinktank.

"Russian officials are cautious because she has taken a tough position on issues involving Iraq and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and on NATO expansion."

Viktor Kremenyuk, deputy director of the independent USA and Canada Institute, said Albright's rhetoric would be tougher than Christopher's even if she pursued the same policies.

"She is more outspoken than Mr Christopher and that may be a problem," Kremenyuk said.

"Another problem is that people in the Baltic states and eastern Europe may cheer her appointment and regard it as encouragement for them in their bids for NATO membership. That certainly will not please Russia."
