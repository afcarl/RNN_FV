Russia delays budget vote after lively debate.

The lower house of the Russian parliament voted on Friday to delay a decision on the 1997 budget draft until December 15, just 10 days before President Boris Yeltsin plans to return to the Kremlin.

Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his ministers defended the budget before a communist-dominated parliament and stood firm to defend the cornerstones of their economic policy.

But communist leader Gennady Zyuganov delivered a stinging attack on Yeltsin and his government and urged the cabinet to take back its budget and make changes.

"The state is bankrupt, the president is ill, the government is helpless and the Duma is powerless," said Zyuganov, who lost the presidential election to Yeltsin on July 3.

But factions opposing the budget appeared to be running out of steam by the end of the day, and deputies voted 331 to 29 to support a proposal to delay the vote drafted by fiery nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who had earlier opposed the spending plans.

"Why do we have to be in a hurry?" he asked. "A holiday will pass (the December 12 Constitution Day), people will get some rest and calm down."

December 12 and 13 are holidays in Russia, but the next two days -- a Saturday and a Sunday -- are normal working days.

The Duma rejected the cabinet's first spending plan in October and was discussing a revised draft prepared by a special reconciliation commission.

Deputies have complained that the spending plans do not take adequate account of the poorest members of Russia's increasingly unequal society -- those who lost out under market reforms.

The government has been heavily criticised for its huge backlogs in wages and pensions that have, among other things, provoked a national miners' strike, which was in its fourth day on Friday.

The strike and the non-payments crisis are likely to be key issues when Yeltsin, who had a heart operation one month ago, returns to the Kremlin.

Yegor Stroyev, the head of the upper chamber of parliament, said Yeltsin, 65, planned to return to work on December 25, Interfax news agency reported.

"Today he is a mobile, energetic man with lots of colour in his cheeks," the agency quoted Yegor Stroyev, who met Yeltsin at a country residence, as saying. "He told me that he had lost 20 kg (44 lbs) which is natural after such an operation."

Yeltsin is working limited hours as he recovers and Chernomyrdin has led a charge against pressure from deputies and lobby groups to print money to pay overdue wages and pensions.

"We cannot and must not do that. It would mean death for our economy," said Chernomyrdin, who has brought annual inflation down from over 2,000 percent to 22 percent in four years.

Outlining a four-year economic programme, he said the government expected annual growth in gross domestic product of five to six percent and an annual inflation of 5-8 percent by the year 2000.

"The state of our economy is not unclouded but it is far from being hopeless," he said.

Chernomyrdin received unexpected support from Zhirinovsky, who had loudly condemned the budget until Friday.

"We need to support the budget," he told deputies. "But we need to convince the president he needs to change his strategy."

Also on Friday, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Madeleine Albright, nominated by U.S. President Bill Clinton to be Secretary of State, would make a "good partner for dialogue", Interfax reported.
