<p>The lower house of the Russian parliament voted on Friday to delay a decision on the 1997 budget draft until December 15, just 10 days before President Boris Yeltsin plans to return to the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his ministers defended the budget before a communist-dominated parliament and stood firm to defend the cornerstones of their economic policy.</p>
<p>But communist leader Gennady Zyuganov delivered a stinging attack on Yeltsin and his government and urged the cabinet to take back its budget and make changes.</p>
<p>&quot;The state is bankrupt, the president is ill, the government is helpless and the Duma is powerless,&quot; said Zyuganov, who lost the presidential election to Yeltsin on July 3.</p>
<p>But factions opposing the budget appeared to be running out of steam by the end of the day, and deputies voted 331 to 29 to support a proposal to delay the vote drafted by fiery nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who had earlier opposed the spending plans.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do we have to be in a hurry?&quot; he asked. &quot;A holiday will pass (the December 12 Constitution Day), people will get some rest and calm down.&quot;</p>
<p>December 12 and 13 are holidays in Russia, but the next two days -- a Saturday and a Sunday -- are normal working days.</p>
<p>The Duma rejected the cabinet's first spending plan in October and was discussing a revised draft prepared by a special reconciliation commission.</p>
<p>Deputies have complained that the spending plans do not take adequate account of the poorest members of Russia's increasingly unequal society -- those who lost out under market reforms.</p>
<p>The government has been heavily criticised for its huge backlogs in wages and pensions that have, among other things, provoked a national miners' strike, which was in its fourth day on Friday.</p>
<p>The strike and the non-payments crisis are likely to be key issues when Yeltsin, who had a heart operation one month ago, returns to the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Yegor Stroyev, the head of the upper chamber of parliament, said Yeltsin, 65, planned to return to work on December 25, Interfax news agency reported.</p>
<p>&quot;Today he is a mobile, energetic man with lots of colour in his cheeks,&quot; the agency quoted Yegor Stroyev, who met Yeltsin at a country residence, as saying. &quot;He told me that he had lost 20 kg (44 lbs) which is natural after such an operation.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin is working limited hours as he recovers and Chernomyrdin has led a charge against pressure from deputies and lobby groups to print money to pay overdue wages and pensions.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot and must not do that. It would mean death for our economy,&quot; said Chernomyrdin, who has brought annual inflation down from over 2,000 percent to 22 percent in four years.</p>
<p>Outlining a four-year economic programme, he said the government expected annual growth in gross domestic product of five to six percent and an annual inflation of 5-8 percent by the year 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;The state of our economy is not unclouded but it is far from being hopeless,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin received unexpected support from Zhirinovsky, who had loudly condemned the budget until Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to support the budget,&quot; he told deputies. &quot;But we need to convince the president he needs to change his strategy.&quot;</p>
<p>Also on Friday, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Madeleine Albright, nominated by U.S. President Bill Clinton to be Secretary of State, would make a &quot;good partner for dialogue&quot;, Interfax reported.</p>
