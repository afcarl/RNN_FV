Serbian demonstrators, confident of winning a campaign to overturn election rigging by President Slobodan Milosevic's ruling socialists, turned their daily Belgrade street protest into a victory carnival on Friday.

Almost 150,000 protesters thronged the city centre while the supreme court heard a claim from the Zajedno (Together) opposition coalition that it was cheated of a landmark victory in Belgrade local elections on November 17.

Amid signs that Milosevic was ceding ground, a Zajedno legal spokesman cautioned that the court had until Sunday to make up its mind and added: "I am not prepared to forecast the outcome."

The judges can decide whether Zajedno won control of Belgrade or order a review of the result by a lower court which earlier ruled in the socialists' favour.

The mood on the streets was euphoric as the conviction grew that 19 days of sustained protests have inflicted a damaging political setback on the autocratic Milosevic, who has ruled Serbia virtually without challenge for nine years.

Bystanders watching a student march in central Belgrade stepped into the street to hug its leaders and demand autographs. People cheered from windows along the route

Socialist sources fuelled speculation that Miolosevic would surrender Belgrade and the southern town of Nis to end protests that are damaging his government's ability to function.

Information Minister Aleksander Tijanic resigned and became the highest ranking scapegoat among socialist officials being made to take responsibility for Milosevic's embarrassment.

Zajedno leader Zoran Djindjic told demonstrators the opposition's aim was still to oust Milosevic.

"We are not concealing our main aim -- to remove Slobodan Milosevic from power," he said. "But we want to do this in a fair way, in a fair political struggle and the first step is the recognition of the election results."

Zajedno spokesman Slobodan Vuksanovic denied that the opposition was bargaining with Milosevic over a compromise.

"The socialists must admit their defeat in Belgrade, Nis and Kraljevo," he said.

The election-rigging charge dealt a fresh blow to Serbia's international standing, threatening its chances of an early return to the International Monetary Fund and a revival of trade with western Europe.

A poll in the bi-monthly NIN magazine showed Milosevic was suffering politically with a fall in his public support from 26 to 16.5 percent since the demonstrations began.

The rating of Djindjic, the most popular Zajedno leader rose from two to 10 percent in the poll.

The daily Dnevni Telegraf, reporting the supreme court review headlined: "Milosevic gives in, to recognise second round?"

In the immediate aftermath of the elections, the socialists admitted they lost in Belgrade before changing their minds and persuading the municipal court to overturn the result.

Zajedno claims it also won in Nis, Serbia's second city, as well as other industrial towns which the socialists reluctantly surrendered.

A socialist official said the government was eager to "reduce tensions" after coming under heavy Western criticism over its handling of the crisis.

International condemnation, led by the United States, forced Milosevic to restore broadcasts by Belgrade's main independent radio station B-92 after shutting down its transmitter on Tuesday to halt live reports of street marches.

Djindjic said the protests had restored hope for the first time since 1991, when Milosevic crushed street demonstrations with tanks and water cannons.

"For six years we grew accustomed to defeat but now that we tasted victory we are not ready to accept defeat anymore," Djindjic told the throng in the central Republic Square.

Efforts to pave the way to a solution coincided with the return of Milosevic's wife Mirjana from a visit to India.

An avowed Marxist who leads her own party in alliance with the Socialists, she is reputed to wield strong influence over her husband.
