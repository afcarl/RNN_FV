<p>Serbian demonstrators, confident of winning a campaign to overturn election rigging by President Slobodan Milosevic's ruling socialists, turned their daily Belgrade street protest into a victory carnival on Friday.</p>
<p>Almost 150,000 protesters thronged the city centre while the supreme court heard a claim from the Zajedno (Together) opposition coalition that it was cheated of a landmark victory in Belgrade local elections on November 17.</p>
<p>Amid signs that Milosevic was ceding ground, a Zajedno legal spokesman cautioned that the court had until Sunday to make up its mind and added: &quot;I am not prepared to forecast the outcome.&quot;</p>
<p>The judges can decide whether Zajedno won control of Belgrade or order a review of the result by a lower court which earlier ruled in the socialists' favour.</p>
<p>The mood on the streets was euphoric as the conviction grew that 19 days of sustained protests have inflicted a damaging political setback on the autocratic Milosevic, who has ruled Serbia virtually without challenge for nine years.</p>
<p>Bystanders watching a student march in central Belgrade stepped into the street to hug its leaders and demand autographs. People cheered from windows along the route</p>
<p>Socialist sources fuelled speculation that Miolosevic would surrender Belgrade and the southern town of Nis to end protests that are damaging his government's ability to function.</p>
<p>Information Minister Aleksander Tijanic resigned and became the highest ranking scapegoat among socialist officials being made to take responsibility for Milosevic's embarrassment.</p>
<p>Zajedno leader Zoran Djindjic told demonstrators the opposition's aim was still to oust Milosevic.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not concealing our main aim -- to remove Slobodan Milosevic from power,&quot; he said. &quot;But we want to do this in a fair way, in a fair political struggle and the first step is the recognition of the election results.&quot;</p>
<p>Zajedno spokesman Slobodan Vuksanovic denied that the opposition was bargaining with Milosevic over a compromise.</p>
<p>&quot;The socialists must admit their defeat in Belgrade, Nis and Kraljevo,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The election-rigging charge dealt a fresh blow to Serbia's international standing, threatening its chances of an early return to the International Monetary Fund and a revival of trade with western Europe.</p>
<p>A poll in the bi-monthly NIN magazine showed Milosevic was suffering politically with a fall in his public support from 26 to 16.5 percent since the demonstrations began.</p>
<p>The rating of Djindjic, the most popular Zajedno leader rose from two to 10 percent in the poll.</p>
<p>The daily Dnevni Telegraf, reporting the supreme court review headlined: &quot;Milosevic gives in, to recognise second round?&quot;</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the elections, the socialists admitted they lost in Belgrade before changing their minds and persuading the municipal court to overturn the result.</p>
<p>Zajedno claims it also won in Nis, Serbia's second city, as well as other industrial towns which the socialists reluctantly surrendered.</p>
<p>A socialist official said the government was eager to &quot;reduce tensions&quot; after coming under heavy Western criticism over its handling of the crisis.</p>
<p>International condemnation, led by the United States, forced Milosevic to restore broadcasts by Belgrade's main independent radio station B-92 after shutting down its transmitter on Tuesday to halt live reports of street marches.</p>
<p>Djindjic said the protests had restored hope for the first time since 1991, when Milosevic crushed street demonstrations with tanks and water cannons.</p>
<p>&quot;For six years we grew accustomed to defeat but now that we tasted victory we are not ready to accept defeat anymore,&quot; Djindjic told the throng in the central Republic Square.</p>
<p>Efforts to pave the way to a solution coincided with the return of Milosevic's wife Mirjana from a visit to India.</p>
<p>An avowed Marxist who leads her own party in alliance with the Socialists, she is reputed to wield strong influence over her husband.</p>
