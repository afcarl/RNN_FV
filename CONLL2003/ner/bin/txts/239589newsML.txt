Tajik government steps up attacks against rebels.

DUSHANBE 1996-12-06

The Tajik government said on Friday its troops freed the city of Komsomolabad and surrounding settlements from opposition guerrillas after a battle.

Presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov said the government also moved forces toward Garm, a regional center where a battalion of troops has been under siege since Sunday.

On Thursday Islamist fighters gave government troops an ultimatum to lay down their arms there and gain safe passage, or face destruction.

As fighting continued for a fourth successive day on Friday in the country of 5.7 million, Russian forces reinforced positions in eastern Tajikistan.

Tajik interior ministry officials reported a clash in the village of Chinor near Nurek, 60 km (37 miles) east of the capital Dushanbe.

Saidov said the opposition suffered many casualties during the fighting in Komsomolabad, and government soldiers were also wounded as they gained control at around noon local time (0800 GMT) on Friday.

As the government stepped up its effort to free its forces in Garm, paratroopers landed and took control of the Dushanbe-Garm highway, the presidential spokesman said.

Russia's Itar-Tass news agency said fighting continued in central Tajikistan near Garm and outside the village of Chorsada.

Russian military sources said Russia's 201st motor-rifle division had brought in new reinforcements near Nurek.

Russia has troops in Tajikistan, where the government and Islamist guerrillas have been fighting for nearly five years under an agreement to help patrol the frontier.

Tajik interior ministry officials said additional ministry troops were also being moved to Nurek's hydro-power station, the biggest in Central Asia, for security reasons.

They said about 100 opposition fighters were located near Chinor, about 15 km (nine miles) from Nurek, where they had exchanged fire with government troops. There was no word of casualties.

Tass quoted Tajik government officials as saying the government would again urge the guerrilla fighters to abandon the areas they have seized, including the Garm region.

In a clash on Wednesday, unidentified attackers fired shots and threw grenades in an assault on a Russian air force supply base near the Tajik capital's airport.

The announcement last week that Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov Rakhmonov and opposition leader Sayid Abdullo Nuri would hold peace talks in northern Afghanistan on December 9 was followed by a flare-up in fighting round Garm.

Saidov said in an interview that the government regards its increased military actions as emergency measures that do not mark a refusal to continue dialogue with the opposition.
