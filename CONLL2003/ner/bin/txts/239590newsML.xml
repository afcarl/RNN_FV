<title>RUSSIA: Russia's Primakov calls Albright a good partner.</title>
<headline>Russia's Primakov calls Albright a good partner.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said on Friday that Madeleine Albright, nominated by U.S. President Bill Clinton to be Secretary of State, would make a &quot;good partner for dialogue&quot;.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said Primakov, speaking to reporters, had described Albright as a &quot;good professional, a person who defends her convictions firmly and sometimes toughly&quot;.</p>
<p>Primakov also said Albright, who was nominated by Clinton on Thursday and now requires Senate approval, had cooperated well as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations with the Russian ambassador, Sergei Lavrov.</p>
<p>Relations between the United States and Russia enjoyed a brief period of euphoria after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 but have been strained by differences since then, particularly over NATO's plans to expand eastwards.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted First Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov as saying Moscow was ready for &quot;most active and constructive&quot; work with Albright.</p>
<p>But Ivanov noted that policy would be shaped by Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin, who meet next March for their first summit since both were re-elected.</p>
<p>&quot;Our countries' leaders have agreed to meet in March, 1997. The Russian foreign ministry believes the new directions in the development of Russian-U.S. relations will be worked out there,&quot; Ivanov told Interfax.</p>
<p>Interfax, outlining Albright's biography, pointed out that she had defended Washington's interests fiercely as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and that this had included actively supporting NATO's enlargment plans.</p>
<p>Russia opposes the Western alliances plans to take in countries of eastern and central Europe which used to be part of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact because, it says, such moves would threaten its security.</p>
