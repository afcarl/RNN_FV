Ukraine lashes Russian vote on claiming Sevastopol.

President Leonid Kuchma's security adviser accused Russia's parliament on Friday of behaving like a bully by laying claim to the naval port of Sevastopol and deputies began moves to kick Moscow's forces out of Ukraine.

"This position is not just unrestrained but simply aggressive," Volodymyr Horbulin, Secretary of the policy-making Security and Defence Council, told reporters in his office.

"This will lead to a sharp worsening in Russian-Ukrainian relations," he said.

Moscow's Federation Council upper house endorsed a resolution by 110 to 14 on Thursday saying Kiev had no right to govern the port which is on Ukraine's Black Sea coast.

"This is a crude piece of interference in the life of a neighbouring country," Horbulin said of the demand that Kiev surrender the port, home to the Black Sea Fleet which Russia and Ukraine have been arguing over since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.

The decision in Moscow was not binding on President Boris Yeltsin or the government, but it was certain to further complicate deadlocked talks on the fleet.

Parliament in Ukraine responded furiously, scheduling a debate on a draft law ordering the withdrawal of about 150 ships and at least 12,000 sailors under Russian command in Sevastopol.

The draft, which in theory will get a first reading in days, is unlikely to be passed unless the Kremlin backs its deputies.

The constitution bans foreign armed forces from Ukrainian soil but an amendment allowed a temporary deployment.

Horbulin spoke before Yeltsin's press secretary, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, indicated at a briefing that the Kremlin had not changed its position, saying Sevastopol was Ukrainian territory.

Parliament chairman Olexander Moroz said Moscow had been warned not to make claims on Ukrainian territory and accused his Russian colleagues of jeopardising European security.

"Unfortunately Russia did not listen to Ukraine's opinion. On the contrary, this latest step has aggravated the situation to the very limit," Moroz said.

Talks on the fleet have stalled on how and if Russia should pay to keep its share of the fleet in Sevastopol, and Kiev has rejected Moscow's demand that it move out its some 20 vessels.

The two sides had agreed in principle that Russia should lease the port for 20 years but no deal was signed.

Officials have said Kiev might raise any such territorial claims at the United Nations, and Horbulin has signalled a shift in its position on the NATO expansion eastwards -- which Russia opposes -- by saying Ukraine might join in future.

"We have made up a list of various reactions, including exerting our influence in international bodies," Horbulin said.

The pressure from Moscow was likely to increase pro-Western and anti-Russian trends in Kiev, which has recently warmed to the idea of joining the NATO alliance.
