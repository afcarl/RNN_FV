The Serbian supreme court on Friday heard an appeal by opposition parties against election- rigging by the ruling socialists that triggered huge protests against President Slobodan Milosevic, Radio B-92 reported.

The move came as a magazine poll showed public support for Milosevic had fallen sharply since students and opposition parties launched mass demonstrations 19 days ago.

A spokesman for the Zajedno (Together) coalition cautioned that the court had until Sunday morning to make up its mind and added: "I am not prepared to forecast the outcome."

The court can decide whether Zajedno won control of Belgrade in November 17 local elections or order a review of the result by municipal judges who earlier ruled in the socialists' favour.

Thousands of students and opposition supporters thronged central Belgrade for a 19th day of protests on Friday amid signs the autocratic Milosevic was preparing an unprecedented climbdown.

Socialist sources who declined to be named fuelled speculation that he would sacrifice Belgrade and the southern town of Nis to the opposition to secure an end to protests that are damaging his government's ability to function.

Zajedno spokesman Slobodan Vuksanovic denied that the opposition was bargaining with Milosevic over a compromise.

"The socialists must admit their defeat in Belgrade, Nis and Kraljevo," he said.

The election-rigging charge dealt a fresh blow to Serbia's international standing, threatening its chances of an early return to the International Monetary Fund and a revival of trade with western Europe.

A poll in the bi-monthly NIN magazine showed Milosevic was suffering politically with a fall in his public support from 26 to 16.5 percent since the demonstrations began.

The rating of Zoran Djindjic, the most popular Zajedno leader, rose from two to 10 percent in the poll.

The daily Dnevni Telegraf, reporting the supreme court review headlined: "Milosevic gives in, to recognise second round?"

In the immediate aftermath of the elections, the socialists admitted they lost in Belgrade before changing their minds and persuading the municipal court to overturning the result.

Zajedno claims it also won in Nis, Serbia's second city, as well as other industrial towns.

A socialist official said the government was eager to "reduce tensions" after coming under heavy Western criticism over its handling of the crisis.

International condemnation, led by the United States, forced Milosevic to restore broadcasts by Belgrade's main independent radio station B-92 after shutting down its transmitter on Tuesday to halt live reports of street marches.

Djindjic said the protests had restored hope for the first time since 1991, when Milosevic crushed street demonstrations with tanks and water cannons.

"For six years we grew accustomed to defeat but now that we tasted victory we are not ready to accept defeat any more," Djindjic told the throng in the central Republic Square.

Efforts to pave the way to a solution coincided with the return of Milosevic's wife Mirjana from a visit to India.

An avowed Marxist who leads her own party in alliance with the Socialists, she is reputed to wield strong influence over her husband.

The Serbian leader has also met President Momir Bulatovic of Montenegro, Serbia's partner in the Yugoslav federation, which has issued barely coded cries of alarm at the Belgrade turmoil.
