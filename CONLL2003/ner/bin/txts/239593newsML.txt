Russian parliament ponders budget in lively debate.

Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his ministers faced a largely hostile Russian parliament on Friday over the 1997 budget plan and stood firm in defence of the cornerstones of their economic policy.

Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov delivered a stinging attack on Yeltsin and his government in his speech to the opposition-dominated State Duma and urged the cabinet to take back its budget draft and make changes.

"The state is bankrupt, the president is ill, the government is helpless and the Duma (lower chamber of parliament) is powerless," said Zyuganov, who lost the presidential election to Yeltsin on July 3.

Zyuganov's communists are the biggest faction in the Duma and their position might be decisive when the legislature votes on the budget later on Friday.

Chernomyrdin rejected pressure from various deputies and lobby groups to print money to pay overdue wages and pensions.

"We cannot and must not do that. It would mean death for our economy," said the prime minister, who has brought inflation down from over 2,000 percent to 22 percent in four years.

Outlining a new four-year economic programme, he said the government expected annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of five to six percent and an annual inflation rate of five to eight percent by the year 2000.

"The state of our economy is not unclouded but it is far from being hopeless," he said.

The prime minister received unexpected support from fiery nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who had loudly criticised the budget until Friday.

"We need to support the budget, and we need to support it on the first ballot," he said in a speech which also critised President Boris Yeltsin's reform. "But we need to convince the president that he needs to change his strategy."

The government under Chernomyrdin has been heavily criticised for its huge backlogs in wages and pensions which have, among other things, provoked a national miners' strike, now in its fourth day. His clash with the Duma is one of the biggest challenges of his four years in office.

The prime minister, who is effectively running Russia while Yeltsin recovers from a major heart operation, admitted corrections were needed in economic policy.

In the debate, pro-reform fraction leader Grigory Yavlinksy came out against the budget, calling for more funding of science, culture and education.  The leader of the conservative Agrarian Party also opposed the budget.

The Duma rejected the cabinet's first spending plan in October and was discussing a revised draft, prepared by a special reconciliation commission.

Leading Russian shares slipped on Friday as Western investors stayed away because of political uncertainty and ahead of year-end book-keeping exercises, traders said.

Conflict between the government and Duma could force the president, who is due back in the Kremlin this month, to make a choice eventually between dismissing one or the other of the two bodies.

Yuri Maslyukov, top communist economist in the Duma, attacked the budget draft but warned the deputies not to take any "extreme steps" which might lead to either dissolution of the Duma or to the resignation of the government.
