<title>UKRAINE: Ukraine's Horbulin sees Russia relations worsening.</title>
<headline>Ukraine's Horbulin sees Russia relations worsening.</headline>

<p>Ukraine's second most powerful politician on Friday accused the Russian parliament of aggressive behaviour for laying claim to the Black Sea naval port of Sevastopol and warned relations would deteriorate.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a crude piece of interference in the life of a neighbouring country,&quot; Volodymyr Horbulin, secretary of the policy-making Security and Defence Council, told reporters in his office.</p>
<p>He was speaking a day after Moscow's Federation Council upper house endorsed a demand by 110 to 14 saying Ukraine had no right to govern Sevastopol and that it should surrender the port, base to the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet.</p>
<p>&quot;This position is not just unrestrained but simply aggressive,&quot; Horbulin said, and warned: &quot;This will lead to a sharp worsening in Russian-Ukrainian relations.&quot;</p>
<p>Moscow and Kiev have been arguing over how to split the fleet and how and if Russia should pay to keep its share on what became Ukrainian territory when it won independence in 1991.</p>
<p>Parliament's decision is not binding on President Boris Yeltsin or the government, but it was certain to further complicate deadlocked talks on the fleet.</p>
<p>Horbulin said he could not give any details of what Ukraine's response would be until he had discussed the options with President Leonid Kuchma, who he was due to meet later.</p>
<p>He was speaking before Yeltsin's press secretary, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, indicated at a news briefing that the official Kremlin's position had not changed, saying Sevastopol was Ukrainian territory.</p>
<p>Horbulin also said he was hoping for a reaction from parliament, which was scheduled to discuss the issue of the presence of foreign troops on Ukrainian territory.</p>
<p>The constitution bans foreign armed forces from Ukrainian soil but an amendment allowed a temporary deployment which could be agreed between governments.</p>
<p>Russia and Ukraine had agreed in principle that Moscow should lease the port for 20 years but no agreement has been signed and a visit by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin which had been expected on November 15 failed to take place.</p>
