Czech official retracts fund statement.

PRAGUE 1996-12-06

The state-appointed  administrator of Czech investment fund Trend IF, Emil Busek, on Friday retracted his Thursday's statement on an assets decrease at the fund.

He said in a statement that the information authorised by his office and released to journalists on Thursday, may have contained factual errors.

Spokesman for Busek, Jeffrey Forbes, said some figures could have been misleading and must be checked, adding that a new statement would be released later on Friday. He did not eleaborate.

The original story said the fund's assets fell by almost three times under the management of Kralovehradecka Brokerage (KHB).

The fund was the first-ever to be placed under forced administration by the Finance Ministry last month amid fears that KHB was defrauding it.

Busek said that when KHB took over managing the fund in late 1995, Trend had assets worth 1.23 billion crowns. On November 30, its assets were just over 460 million crowns, and most of those are in the form of doubtful debts.

Trend was founded during the first wave of the Czech Republic's coupon privatisation programme started in 1992.

No criminal charges have been brought in the case.

The fund's shares, which trade on the Prague Stock Exchange's open market, lost 1.40 crowns to close at 43.22 crowns when last traded on Thursday.
