<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his ministers faced a hostile Russian parliament on Friday over the 1997 budget plan and stood firm in defence of the cornerstones of their economic policy.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not going to plead. I want to explain my own position and that of the government,&quot; Chernomrdin told the opposition- dominated State Duma lower house before a debate on the budget.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin is under fire over huge backlogs in wages and pensions which have, among other things, provoked a nationwide miners' strike, now in its fourth day. His clash with the Duma is one of the biggest challenges of his four years in office.</p>
<p>The prime minister, who is effectively running Russia while President Boris Yeltsin recovers from a major heart operation, admitted corrections were needed in economic policy.</p>
<p>But he firmly rejected pressure from various deputies and lobby groups to print money to pay overdue wages and pensions.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot and must not do that. It would mean death for our economy,&quot; said the prime minister, who has brought inflation down from over 2,000 percent to 22 percent in four years.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin, outlining a new four-year economic programme, said the government expected annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of five to six percent and an annual inflation rate of five to eight percent by the year 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;The state of our economy is not unclouded but it is far from being hopeless,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On present trends year-on-year inflation will be 22 percent this month, and the government's budget draft assumes an 11.80 percent year-on-year rate for December 1997.</p>
<p>But against Chernomyrdin's success in fighting inflation, real output has slumped. In the first 10 months of 1996, GDP was six percent lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p>The immediate test for the prime minister will be when the Duma comes to decide on the fate of the 1997 draft budget.</p>
<p>The Duma rejected the cabinet's first spending plan in October and was due to discuss a revised draft, prepared by a special reconciliation commission. Leaving nothing to chance, Chernomyrdin ordered all his ministers to attend the session.</p>
<p>Leading Russian shares slipped on Friday as Western investors stayed away because of political uncertainty and ahead of year-end book-keeping exercises, traders said.</p>
<p>Several parties in the Duma, including the communists who are the biggest group, oppose the new version of the budget.</p>
<p>The first deputies to speak after Chernomyrdin and his economy guru Finance Minister Alexander Livshits appeared hostile but at the same time betrayed their awareness that the Duma has few powers compared to those of Yeltsin.</p>
<p>Conflict between the government and Duma could force the president, who is due back in the Kremlin this month, to make a choice eventually between dismissing one or the other of the two bodies.</p>
<p>Yuri Maslyukov, top communist economist in the Duma, attacked the budget draft but warned the deputies not to take any &quot;extreme steps&quot; which might lead to either dissolution of the Duma or to the resignation of the government.</p>
<p>&quot;After all we are not living in a parliamentary republic and dissolution of either body will bear little fruit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Chernomyrdin held talks with leaders of the parliamentary factions, including communist chief Gennady Zyuganov and ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky.</p>
<p>But Zyuganov appeared unreconciled on Friday, telling reporters after consulting his faction during a break: &quot;This budget does not suit us, it continues the monetarist trend.&quot;</p>
