Turkmen bread prices double on harvest shortfall.

ASHGABAT 1996-12-06

Authorities in the Central Asian country of Turkmenistan doubled bread prices on Friday after the former Soviet republic reaped a very poor harvest.

Independent specialists say the 1996 grain harvest, completed in August, was about 480,000 tonnes, compared to the government's unrealistic target of 1.2 million tonnes.

In the Turkmen capital, the price of a loaf doubled to 400 manats, while the traditional flat bread sold at open-air markets rose to about 1,500 manats. The Economy and Finances Ministry had called for the increases.

Kazakhstan said this week it might sell 100,000 tonnes of grain to Turkmenistan at a price of at least $165 per tonne.

The country wants annual grain output of 1.5 million tonnes to attain food self-sufficiency to feed its 4.5 million citizens.

($1 = about 4,045 manats)
