<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Friday outlined to the opposition-dominated State Duma lower house of parliament a promising future for Russia by the year 2000 but firmly rejected pressure to print money.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not going to plead. I want to explain my own position and that of the government,&quot; Chernoymrdin told the largely hostile deputies before a debate on the 1997 budget.</p>
<p>He said Russia needed to make corrections to its economic policy but added, &quot;The state of our economy is not unclouded, but it is far from being hopeless.&quot;</p>
<p>The embattled premier firmly rejected pressure from various members of parliament and lobby groups to print more money to pay overdue wages and pensions.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot and must not do that. It would mean death for our economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government expects annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth of five to six percent and an annual inflation rate of five to eight percent by the year 2000, the premier said, outlining the cabinet's four-year economic programme.</p>
<p>Base on present trends, year-on-year inflation will be 22 percent in December, and the government's budget draft assumes an 11.80-percent year-on-year rate for December 1997.</p>
<p>In the first 10 months of this year, GDP was six-percent lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p>The session of the Duma, due to consider the 1997 budget plan later in the day, is one of the biggest challenges in Chernomyrdin's four years in office.</p>
<p>He is under fire over huge backlogs in wages to public-sector employees and faces a national strike by coal miners, now in its fourth day.</p>
<p>But he appeared relaxed when he arrived at the Duma, telling reporters &quot;Everything is all right.&quot;</p>
<p>The Duma rejected the cabinet's first spending plan in October and was due to discuss a revised draft, prepared by a special reconciliation commission. Leaving nothing to chance, Chernomyrdin ordered all his ministers to attend the session.</p>
<p>Several parties in the Duma, including the big Communist Party group, have opposed the new version of the budget.</p>
<p>Conflict between the government and Duma could force President Boris Yeltsin, who is recovering from heart surgery, to make a choice eventually between dismissing one of the two bodies.</p>
