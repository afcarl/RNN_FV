<p>President Boris Yeltsin has called for closer ties within the Commonwealth of Independent States as the loose grouping that replaced the Soviet Union marks its fifth anniversary, Interfax news agency said on Friday.</p>
<p>In an interview with Interfax and Trud newspaper, Yeltsin said the CIS had notched up some important achievements but added that much more remained to be done.</p>
<p>&quot;Integration in the CIS could move more swiftly and more effectively,&quot; said Yeltsin, who is recovering from heart surgery at a country residence near Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;I am speaking...of the development of mutually advantageous relations, of working together, especially in industry, in trade and so forth. Here is an enormous field of activity.&quot;</p>
<p>He said integration depended on the will of all 12 member states and not only Russia.</p>
<p>The CIS groups all the former Soviet republics except the three Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said a &quot;community&quot; agreed earlier this year between Russia and Belarus highlighted the mutual advantages of cooperation in areas like customs and energy.</p>
<p>The leaders of the old Soviet Union's three core Slavic republics -- Russia, Belarus and Ukraine -- met at a Belarussian hunting lodge on December 8, 1991 to sign the Soviet Union out of existence and usher in the grouping of independent states.</p>
<p>Yeltsin was quoted saying the CIS was the only politically viable idea capable of replacing the communist superpower.</p>
<p>&quot;The Soviet Union had become obsolete. We had to save what it was still possible to save,&quot; he said. &quot;Nobody suggested any other model of mutual cooperation.&quot;</p>
<p>Russian nationalists and communists have been very critical of the CIS and the loss of Russian influence it entails.</p>
