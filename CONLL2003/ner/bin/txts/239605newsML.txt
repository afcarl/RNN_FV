Donors pledge $30 mln for Croatian Serb-held area.

ZAGREB 1996-12-06

International donors pledged more than $30 million next year for the reconstruction of Croatia's last Serb-held area, the United Nations said on Friday.

The U.N. administration of Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES) put the rebuilding costs at $1.1 billion for the region which was heavily damaged in the 1991 Croatian-Serb war.

UNTAES said governments of several European countries and the United States would take part in funding projects in the area to rebuild houses, roads and other infrastracture.

Eastern Slavonia suffered terrible destruction during the Serb minority uprising against Croatia's bid for independence from former Yugoslavia.

It has been under UNTAES control since January and will remain so until June 1997.

Croatia recaptured other Serb-held regions in two offensives in 1995.

"This conference was a good start, but we have a long road to go...we need a lot of money for reconstruction," deputy UNTAES head Derek Boothby told Croatian radio.

The radio said some $34 million was raised from donations in the past.

Total war damage in Croatia is estimated at more than 150 billion kuna.

Croatian state news agency HINA quoted reconstruction minister Jure Radic as saying the country had so far invested five billion kuna for reconstruction and would allow another two billion from next year's budget.
