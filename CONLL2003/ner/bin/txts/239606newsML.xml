<title>RUSSIA: Grozny airport reopens to civilian flights.</title>
<headline>Grozny airport reopens to civilian flights.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>A civilian airliner landed at the main airport in the capital of breakaway Chechnya on Friday, the first since Russia's decision to pull out its troops last August.</p>
<p>Russia's commercial NTV television boarded the TU-134's flight from Moscow to Grozny. &quot;It is a historic day,&quot; the commentator said, adding that the city's Severny airport had been renamed after a Chechen independence hero.</p>
<p>The airport in Grozny had been closed to civilian flights for months while Chechen rebels battled with soldiers sent there by Moscow to crush the Caucasus region's independence bid.</p>
<p>But an August agreement brought 21 months of fighting to an end and Russian President Boris Yeltsin said last month he would withdraw the Russian troops, many of whom have been based at the airport, by January.</p>
<p>NTV said the small passenger plane, operated by Donavia, nearly had to seek another landing site when the pilots could not make radio communication with the Chechen airport. NTV said power supplies at the airport were switched on just on time.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted a senior airline official as saying that the airline planned seven flights a week between Moscow and Grozny.</p>
