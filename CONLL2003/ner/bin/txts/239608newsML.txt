Divided Russian parliament delays budget decision.

Weary Russian lawmakers, unable to agree on a blueprint for Russia's economic well-being, voted on Friday to delay further discussion of the 1997 budget with three weeks left before it was due to take affect.

Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who addressed the Duma lower house of parliament early in the day, approved the move.

"This is not the time or the place to hurry. After all, this is the budget, the law by which our country will live," he told reporters.

The vote, after a long day of cantankerous debate, delayed a decision on the first reading of a re-jigged plan until Sunday, December 15, which will be a working day in Russia. The draft envisages a deficit of 3.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product.

If deputies fail to approve a new budget by the end of the year -- as appears increasingly likely -- Russia will adopt interim budgets or re-use the 1996 law.

But conflict between the government and Duma could force the president, who is due back in the Kremlin this month, to make a choice eventually between dismissing one of the two bodies.

The budget debate has focused on sharply different ideas of how to manage Russia's future recovery, and what to do with its economic gains, such as annual inflation which will be about 22 percent this year after 131 percent to December 1995.

Communist deputies who make up the largest faction in the Duma say Russia has made a startling success bringing down inflation but they believe Russians have been punished by reform and must now be helped.

Workers are owed billions of dollars in back wages and the state, owed billions in taxes, cannot meet all its commitments.

"The state is bankrupt, the president is ill, the government is helpless and the Duma is powerless," communist leader Gennady Zyuganov told the Duma, calling on deputies to reject the draft budget in its first reading.

Communist proposals call for increased spending, to be covered by a larger budget deficit or printing money.

But Chernomyrdin defended reforms and said Russian GDP, which shrank six percent in the year to October, would grow by 5-6 percent a year by 2000. Inflation would fall to 5-8 percent.

He called for the pace of tax reform to be quickened and for more taxes to be collected to enable the authorities to lower tax rates. A new and simpler tax code is being worked on in committee in the Duma.

Officials have said Russia collected only 70 percent of targeted taxes in the first 11 months of this year, and is likely to raise only 75 percent over the year as a whole.

Unpaid taxes, together with wage arrears, are among Russia's biggest economic headaches and the International Monetary Fund has withheld tranches of its $10 billion, three-year loan, citing poor tax collection.

Only foreign investors, who paid little attention to the budget turmoil today, have given Russia a vote of confidence, oversubscribing for its recent $1 billion post-Communist debut Eurobond, a chance to borrow dollars abroad, by a factor of two.

Markets in Russian debt and equities have taken heart from the apparently successful recovery of President Boris Yeltsin from heart surgery.
