Ukraine has solved a transit tariff row with Moscow and is fulfilling a dream of reducing its dependency on Russia and Turkmenistan, a top energy official told Reuters on Friday.

Olexander Sverdlov, who heads the transit department at the State Oil and Gas Committee, said Ukraine had signed deals with the Central Asian state of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan and was conducting an intense hunt for new gas sources.

"Of course Russia is not entirely delighted at the prospect of Central Asia fulfilling all our gas needs. They want to sell their gas," Sverdlov said.

Relations between Ukraine and Russia have not always been smooth since Kiev won its independence in 1991 and the presence of pipelines on both territories which were once owned by the Soviet regime has proved a major complication.

Five years after Moscow lost its grip on former Soviet republics Russia still controls gas crossing its territory from Central Asia to Ukraine and on to the West.

Sverdlov said the whole of Europe was seeking alternative routes. "The situation would be ideal if we could avoid transit through Russian territory," he said.

But Ukraine has a bargaining chip of its own -- Russian gas crosses its territory on its way to paying customers in Europe.

Russia does not actually pay its former Soviet neighbour anything for transit, paying in gas for domestic use instead.

"If we paid Russian suppliers in cash, instead of barter, we would get $2.5 billion a year for transit," Sverdlov said.

"But you know what the economic situation is like -- we cannot pay for imports in cash so we cannot demand cash from Russia," he said.

For months Moscow and Kiev have been trying and failing to agree on transit charges, but Sverdlov said they had cracked the problem this week.

Ukrainian and Russian energy officials agreed in Moscow that Kiev would import 53 billion cubic metres of Russian gas in 1997 -- three billion more than this year, Sverdlov said.

Russia had agreed to allow up to 25 billion cubic metres of non-Russian gas could cross its territory to Ukraine next year, he said.

The deal set charges for an annual 130 billion cubic metres of Russian gas crossing Ukrainian territory, he said.

Kiev would set a tariff of $1.75 per 1,000 cubic metres per hundred km (62 miles), but Russia would pay this in gas, supplying Ukraine at the same price as this year -- $80 per 1,000 cubic metres.

Sverdlov said Ukraine had wanted to charge Moscow more for transit tariffs but eventually gave in.

Meanwhile Turkmen gas imports would be reduced to 10 billion cubic metres from 18 billion.

But the best news as far as Sverdlov was concerned was a deal signed by Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko in Uzbekistan to buy six billion cubic metres of gas, with the prospect of increasing the volume to 10 billion cubic metres in future.

Ukraine has also agreed to purchase five billion cubic metres of gas from Kazakhstan next year.

"It is very important to us that we are looking and have already found alternative gas sources. We should stay in Central Asia," Sverdlov said.
