<p>The European Commission appealed to the Bulgarian government on Friday to improve the safety of four of its Soviet-made reactors while it seeks alternative energy resources.</p>
<p>A statement of the European Union's office in Sofia, carried by the local news agency BTA, said a development of a programme for non-nuclear energy supplies would correspond to Bulgaria's commitments under a nuclear safety account agreement which Bulgaria signed in 1993.</p>
<p>Then Bulgaria received a grant of 24 million Ecus, aimed at assisting Sofia to close its four 440-megawatt reactors as soon as energy supplies allow.</p>
<p>The sum was funded under the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's Nuclear Safety Account, administered by the EBRD on behalf of donor countries.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission appeals to the Bulgarian government to work out a programme for alternative conventional energy resources, which will allow the closure of reactors one, two, three and four at Kozloduy,&quot; BTA said.</p>
<p>The statement said the condition of the vessel of reactor number one was within the limits of the acceptable safety level following the results of the tests of its metal samples.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on this information, a permision on the reactor's restart this winter may be asked by the Bulgarian Atomic Energy Committee,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Experts from Germany's Siemens AG and Russia's Korchatov Institute said earlier on Friday that tests on the oldest nuclear reactor at Kozloduy show that the metal of its vessel is safe and the reactor can be operated.</p>
<p>Bulgaria switched off the Soviet-made reactor number one at the Kozloduy plant in May for tests after the international community expressed concern over its safety.</p>
<p>The chairman of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant Kiril Nikolov said upgrading of reactor number one was underway and the reactor was expected to be put on stream on January 20.</p>
<p>Apart from its four 440-megawatt reactors, the Kozloduy plant has two 1,000-megawatt reactors. Bulgaria relies on the Kozloduy plant for more than 40 percent of its electricity needs.</p>
