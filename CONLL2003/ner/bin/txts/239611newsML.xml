<p>A Canadian-led gold joint venture working on a Kazakh mine said on Friday that it would become the first foreign firm to export gold officially from Kazakhstan since the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Charles Pitcher, president of Canada's Central Asia Goldfields Corp, a partner in the firm, said Gold Pool Joint Venture would ship 100 kilograms of gold to London next week,</p>
<p>Britain's Johnson Matthey will refine it down to five mines, or 99.999 percent pure gold, he said.</p>
<p>Gold Pool, 25-percent owned by Central Asia Goldfields Corp and 75-percent owned by Canada's Kazakhstan Goldfields Corp, won a 25-year contract in March to manage, with right to purchase, three gold mines in northern Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>The Aksu, Bestube and Jolimbet mines, located around the former secret uranium-mining centre of Stepnogorsk, are expected to produce about one tonne of gold this year. That will increase to four tonnes in 1997 and seven to eight tonnes in 1998.</p>
<p>Peak production at the mines was 5.3 tonnes in 1989, but the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Kazakhstan's rocky road to a market economy, saw production plummet.</p>
<p>&quot;We lost our earlier achievement through mismanagement on the road to the market,&quot; said a senior regional official.</p>
<p>Several large mining companies passed over the opportunity to restart the mines, fearing they were beyond redemption.</p>
<p>&quot;The big companies did not like the look of the old plant on top,&quot; said John Hansuld, president of Kazakhstan Goldfields. &quot;We looked at the reserves underneath.&quot;</p>
<p>Gold Pool was blunt with the Kazakh management and said the workforce too large -- 40 to 50 percent of workers have been laid off since March.</p>
<p>The joint venture has invested $15 million so far in the venture and plans to invest a further $30 million next year.</p>
<p>Much of the mining work will be subcontracted with the aim of boosting production to around 250,000 ounces of gold a year at a cash cost of $250 per ounce.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Kazakhstan has first right to buy the gold, but Gold Pool's ability to ship to Western markets is crucial to investor confidence in the region.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan scrapped the results of an auction for the Vasilkovskoye gold mine last year after it had picked Canada's Placer Dome as the winner of the mine, with gold reserves of over 13 million ounces.</p>
<p>Canada's Nelson Gold Corp Ltd on Thursday said it had successfully shipped and sold 12,700 ounces of gold from war-torn Tajikistan, after a battle with the government over export rights.</p>
<p>&quot;Up until now there has been a lot of negative publicity about Central Asia,&quot; said Andrew King, vice-president of Nelson.</p>
<p>Now that junior companies like Gold Pool and Nelson are discovering success, it will not be long before the majors refocus on the remote region -- Canada's Cameco and the U.S.'s Newmont Mining Corp are already operating in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not just important for us and Kazakhstan,&quot; said Hansuld. &quot;This is a real bellwether for the whole CIS.&quot;</p>
