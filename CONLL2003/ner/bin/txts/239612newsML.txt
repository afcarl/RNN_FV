Hungarian energy workers said they staged protests for higher wages in Germany and Belgium on Friday -- in what their union leaders claimed was the first demonstration by eastern European employees at the headquarters of western European investors.

The protests took place at the headquarters of Germany's RWE and Belgium's Tractebel, both western European utilities investing in Hungary's energy sector.

Dissatisfaction with wage back-payments had forced unions to cross borders to Essen and Brussels, said Laszlo Petke, vice president of the Electricity Industry Workers' Trade Union Association.

"It is becoming more and more common in Hungary that employers do not fulfil wage agreements," said Petke. "We are trying to stop this."

The trade union leader said the investors had promised that wages in the electricity companies they had bought would preserve their real value in 1996.

But employees will receive only a 19.5 percent back-payment for 1996 in January, while the trade unions are demanding 25 percent, which they say is in line with inflation.

Petke said RWE and Tractebel led resistance among Western investors to the agreed increases.

But a Budapest paper reported on Friday that Tractebel was looking to sell back its stake in its Dunamenti power station after Hungary's government announced January energy price rises below the firm's expectations.

The daily Nepszabadsag quoted another union official as saying Tractebel had hired a New York-based legal firm to represent it in talks.

The Belgians are believed to be unhappy with the government's decision to allow utilities to increase retail electricity prices by 25 percent from January which analysts say will not allow them the eight-per-cent return on investment they are looking for.

The article quoted Tractebel's representative in Hungary Tibor Kuhl as saying the firm had not decided its next step.

"The lawyers are looking into the situation, which in their opinion in the case of Dunamenti power station is extremely serious," Kuhl is quoted as saying.

Officials at Tractebel were unavailable for comment on Friday.

Petke said that if the investors did not make concessions in talks to be held next Friday, the trade unions might call a strike.

He said the demonstrations staged by Hungarian union leaders and some activists from local trade unions, were small due to the distance involved in getting there.

"Passers-by appeared to be sympathetic to our flyers," he said.

Tractebel and RWE are among a number of West European utilities, including Electricite de France, which paid a total of around $2 billion at the end of last year for stakes in Hungary's energy sector in the biggest utility sell-off of any post-Communist state.
