<headline>Polish c.bank sees credit issuance rising too fast.</headline>

<p>The National Bank of Poland signalled on Friday that credit was growing faster than needed by the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Credit action is too big from the point of view of the economy's needs,&quot; Jacek Osinski, deputy head of the central bank's monetary policy department, told a group of bankers.</p>
<p>He suggested the recent boom in credit supply was the main cause of the money market's cash shortage, which pulled market rates up to lombard levels this week.</p>
<p>The head of the NBP's monetary policy department Jerzy Stopyra, also present, said real interest rates would rise next year as credit was growing faster than deposits in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth rate of deposits in the banking system is less dynamic than that of credit action,&quot; Stopyra said .</p>
<p>Credit to the non-financial sector rose by 34.7 percent from the start of the year to November 20, while zloty deposits increased by 27.4 percent and foreign currency deposits of the non-financial sector rose by 7.2 percent.</p>
<p>Osinski said deposit rates in some Polish banks fell too deeply in recent months and along with fast growing credit were paring the banking system's over-liquidity.</p>
<p>He reiterated that the money market, which has been over-liquid for several years, would start losing its excess funds next year.</p>
<p>&quot;A cash-shortage on the market may become more typical,&quot; Osinski said.</p>
<p>He said repo operations between commercial banks would likely become more common next year and increase the market's liquidity in 1997. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700</p>
