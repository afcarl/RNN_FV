Croat Privredna sees improvement after overhaul.

ZAGREB 1996-12-06

Croatia's troubled Privredna Banka Zagreb said on Friday it hoped its future performance would improve considerably as a result of the government's efforts to overhaul it by taking on liabilities of insolvent state firms.

"Results in 1997 and 1998 will be much better than this year's after this 'cancerous tissue' has been removed," chief executive Martin Katicic told a news conference.

He said latest figures showed internal restructuring measures were likely to enable the bank to make a profit this year after posting a loss of 365 million kuna ($65.9 million) in 1995.

Few details have been made public of official plans to revive the bank, which were given a green light by the government on Thursday.

According to some reports, the bank's total assets will be cut to 12 from 19 billion kuna, while it would receive a fresh 1.6 billion kuna injection in the form of government bonds.

The operation, which is hoped to support the restructuring of some key state-owned firms -- such as Privredna's biggest debtor, oil firm INA -- is expected to cost tax payers some three billion kuna.

Katicic said Privredna would participate in the overhaul with 2.284 billion kuna from its own reserves.

According to Privredna's own proposal, the bank will transfer some 6.1 billion kuna in non-performing assets to the state rehabilitation agency.

"The government would thus assume responsibility of the original borrowers (including state-owned firms) that are unable to repay them," said economist Zeljko Rohatinski, hired to advise the bank in its restructuring efforts.

He added the biggest problem was 3.8 billion kuna in foreign liabilities, some of which fall due for repayment soon.

Privredna's share in Croatia's total pre-1991 debt to external creditors is estimated at 66 percent.

Among these assets are loans, dating back to well before Croatia's break-off from Yugoslavia, which would have to be collected from companies now located in other former republics. ($ = 5.535 Croatian Kuna)
