<p>Croatia's troubled Privredna Banka Zagreb said on Friday it hoped its future performance would improve considerably as a result of the government's efforts to overhaul it by taking on liabilities of insolvent state firms.</p>
<p>&quot;Results in 1997 and 1998 will be much better than this year's after this 'cancerous tissue' has been removed,&quot; chief executive Martin Katicic told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said latest figures showed internal restructuring measures were likely to enable the bank to make a profit this year after posting a loss of 365 million kuna ($65.9 million) in 1995.</p>
<p>Few details have been made public of official plans to revive the bank, which were given a green light by the government on Thursday.</p>
<p>According to some reports, the bank's total assets will be cut to 12 from 19 billion kuna, while it would receive a fresh 1.6 billion kuna injection in the form of government bonds.</p>
<p>The operation, which is hoped to support the restructuring of some key state-owned firms -- such as Privredna's biggest debtor, oil firm INA -- is expected to cost tax payers some three billion kuna.</p>
<p>Katicic said Privredna would participate in the overhaul with 2.284 billion kuna from its own reserves.</p>
<p>According to Privredna's own proposal, the bank will transfer some 6.1 billion kuna in non-performing assets to the state rehabilitation agency.</p>
<p>&quot;The government would thus assume responsibility of the original borrowers (including state-owned firms) that are unable to repay them,&quot; said economist Zeljko Rohatinski, hired to advise the bank in its restructuring efforts.</p>
<p>He added the biggest problem was 3.8 billion kuna in foreign liabilities, some of which fall due for repayment soon.</p>
<p>Privredna's share in Croatia's total pre-1991 debt to external creditors is estimated at 66 percent.</p>
<p>Among these assets are loans, dating back to well before Croatia's break-off from Yugoslavia, which would have to be collected from companies now located in other former republics. ($ = 5.535 Croatian Kuna)</p>
