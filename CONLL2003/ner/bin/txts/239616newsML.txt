Croatia puts off VAT, approves tax changes.

ZAGREB 1996-12-06

Croatia's parliament, the Sabor, on Friday approved postponement of the value added tax (VAT) until January 1, 1998, state media reported.

VAT, originally planned to be introduced at 22 percent next year, came under attack from various social groups and was put off under pressure from the ruling party HDZ.

According to the national news agency HINA, members were said to have passed a proposed profit tax rate increase to 35 from 25 percent, but only after a heated debate.

Croatian radio said the Sabor also passed a law cutting the minimum income tax rate to 20 from 25 percent, in line with a deal the government struck with unions last month.

The same law will enable the non-taxable salary basis to rise to 800 from 700 kuna, and abolish tax on foreign pensions and land. -- Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075
