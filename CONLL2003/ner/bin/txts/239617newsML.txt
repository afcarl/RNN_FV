Poland's regulated over-the-counter market kicked off on Friday with just one stock traded but analysts said the market could become a serious competitor to the Warsaw bourse next year with more material traded.

"The OTC market may become an alternative to the Warsaw bourse perhaps in the first half of 1997, once more stocks enter the market," said Janusz Oleksak, an analyst at Bank Slaski SA brokerage.

"But this still will be a different segment of the market where investors will assume greater risks," he added.

OTC trade started with one 100-share block in Rafamet machine tools maker trading at 14.30 zlotys, up from its issue price of 10 zlotys.

Czeslaw Gawlowski, the head of CeTO SA, a company founded by top Polish securities houses, has said that about 30 companies privatised under Poland's mass privatisation scheme eyed entering this market in the second quarter of 1997.

Analysts have said market turnover and liquidity should improve as more securities houses compete for business as market makers.

CeTO spokeswoman Bogda Zukowska told Reuters that only CeTO shareholders approved by the company's board as brokers and market makers can participate in the market due to trade daily from 1000 to 1400 local time.

CeTO has 43 shareholders, none of which has more than three percent of shares, while there are 12 securties houses authorised for operating on the OTC market of which 11 have been licenced to act as both brokers and market makers.

Gawlowski has said the market would have its own share index called ITO (central bulletin board index) and later would launch other indices for bonds and specific industries.

Zukowska said the market would trade continuously and in contrast to the Warsaw bourse would have no daily price change limits and would allow the buying and selling of the same stock several times during a session.

So far CeTO has approved for OTC trade Rafamet and insurer Polisa, which currently trades on the bourse's main market and is expected to start OTC trade late this month or early next year.

Last month the western town of Ostrow Wielkopolski asked the Polish Securities Commission to allow its 7.5 million zlotys worth of municipal bonds to trade on the OTC market.
