The Polish bourse is seen staying flat or falling slightly next week, continuing its month-long horizontal trend, and analysts said there were no fresh positive impulses to spur growth.

"It's hard to find an unambiguous signal to suggest that there should be a growth trend," said Krzysztof Olszewski, an analyst at Bank Slaski brokerage.

Analysts said the relatively busy initial-public-offering schedule next week suggested capital might be drawn from stocks and that the main market could slip.

But they said significant falls by some fundamentally strong issues since the market's 30-month high on October 9 made enough stocks look attractive enough to keep some buying interest and prevent any deeper falls.

Offerings start on Monday for edible-fats maker  Kruszwica SA, steel products trader  Centrostal SA and insulation materials firm  Izolacja SA.

Analysts also said investors might be staying away from stocks in the face of a possible heavy IPO schedule next year in which giants such as copper firm  KGHM Polksa Miedz SA and Bank Handlowy SA could reach the market.

Analysts also said the Christmas shopping season might be keeping away the retail investors who account for the bulk of day-to-day turnover on the Warsaw bourse.

"Small investors might for example may be redeeming mutual funds units to buy presents," said Ryszard Wojnowski, an analyst at Bank Gdanski brokerage.

They said larger investors might be staying away as well, loathe to take a risk and eager to take profits before their financial year ends.

"Some institutional investors might not want to take a position at the end of the year, perhaps closing positions and investing on the money market rather than on the bourse," Slaski's Olszewski said.

Analysts said Friday's news that food prices rose only 0.1 percent in the third 10 days of November would likely have little effect on stocks next week as the central bank had long said it wanted real interest rates to rise.

But some analysts said the news was a good longer-term signal, suggesting a rate cut was possible toward the end of next year.

Analysts said the main market's top gainer this week, Bytom up 12.1 percent, was continuing the rise begun over a month ago after having fallen for most of the year.

They said the week's biggest loser Kety fell 10.2 percent in profit-taking after recent gains.

Analysts said Optimus, up 6.7 percent on the week, was helped by recent buy recommendations and could continue to flourish after the computer maker announced its retail network would offer electronic games produced by a Walt Disney Co unit.
