Czech utility CEZ union on strike alert.

PRAGUE 1996-12-06

The labour union at Czech power utility CEZ a.s. on Friday went on strike alert, saying a six percent pay hike offered by the firm for 1997 was too low, and opposing a plan to abolish energy discounts for employees.

But CEZ said it saw no reason for such a step as it was convinced that agreement on these issues would be reached.

Frantisek Haman of the union's strike committee said the union would go ahead with "stronger action" if its demands were not met, but he did not specify possible options.

"We don't agree with a six percent increase in pay guaranteed by the employer in the collective negotiations. That would not even cover inflation," he told Reuters.

He added that the union's pay demands, which have not been specified publicly, were "a matter for negotiation".

Spokesman for CEZ Miroslav Novak said the company would negotiate on pay rises after the company's 1997 budget was approved, possibly before Christmas.

He said in a statement that in the past years wages in the company had risen by over 20 percent annually.

"The employer so far guarantees a six percent pay rise as of January 1997. Further wage rises can be debated after the company's budget for the next year is approved," Novak said.

"Above all because the collective agreement must be based on the real possibilities of the company."

The statement said CEZ management "is persuaded that together with unions it will proceed to a balanced collective agreement."

The Czech Statistical Bureau forecasts 1996 annual inflation to end the year at about 8.9 percent and to fall to 7.5-8.0 percent in 1997.
