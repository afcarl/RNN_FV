<title>CZECH REPUBLIC: Czech utility CEZ union on strike alert.</title>
<headline>Czech utility CEZ union on strike alert.</headline>
<dateline>PRAGUE 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The labour union at Czech power utility CEZ a.s. on Friday went on strike alert, saying a six percent pay hike offered by the firm for 1997 was too low, and opposing a plan to abolish energy discounts for employees.</p>
<p>But CEZ said it saw no reason for such a step as it was convinced that agreement on these issues would be reached.</p>
<p>Frantisek Haman of the union's strike committee said the union would go ahead with &quot;stronger action&quot; if its demands were not met, but he did not specify possible options.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't agree with a six percent increase in pay guaranteed by the employer in the collective negotiations. That would not even cover inflation,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He added that the union's pay demands, which have not been specified publicly, were &quot;a matter for negotiation&quot;.</p>
<p>Spokesman for CEZ Miroslav Novak said the company would negotiate on pay rises after the company's 1997 budget was approved, possibly before Christmas.</p>
<p>He said in a statement that in the past years wages in the company had risen by over 20 percent annually.</p>
<p>&quot;The employer so far guarantees a six percent pay rise as of January 1997. Further wage rises can be debated after the company's budget for the next year is approved,&quot; Novak said.</p>
<p>&quot;Above all because the collective agreement must be based on the real possibilities of the company.&quot;</p>
<p>The statement said CEZ management &quot;is persuaded that together with unions it will proceed to a balanced collective agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>The Czech Statistical Bureau forecasts 1996 annual inflation to end the year at about 8.9 percent and to fall to 7.5-8.0 percent in 1997.</p>
