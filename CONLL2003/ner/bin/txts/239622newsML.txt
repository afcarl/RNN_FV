BUDAPEST 1996-12-06

A $160 million loan syndicated to Russia's Gazprom group by a group of Hungarian banks, was oversubscribed, Hungarian news agency MTI said.

MTI, quoting a statement from Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank Rt (MKB), one of the lead managers, did not specify the size of oversubscription.

MKB was unavailable for immediate comment.

The loan, the first to be arranged for Gazprom by Hungarian banks, will be used to finance Gazprom's gas deliveries to Hungary, it said.

The two other co-lead managers of the loan were OTP Bank and Altalanos Ertekforgalmi Bank Rt (AEB) in which a Gazprom subsidiary, Gazprombank, became sole owner earlier this year.

The group of banking consortium included Postabank Rt, Kereskedelmi es Hitelbank Rt, Budapest Bank Rt, which is the Hungarian banking unit of GE, Daewoo Bank Magyarorszag Rt, Inter-Europa Bank and Magyar Takarekszovetkezei Bank Rt.
