WARSAW 1996-12-06

Poland's treasury ministry is expected to announce a short list of prospective investors in edible fats producer Kruszwica SA by the end of the month, Kruszwica's president said on Friday.

"By the end of December the treasury ministry will announce a short list of firms interested in buying Kruszwica's shares, from which strategic investors would later be chosen," Ryszard Staszak told Reuters.

The ministry has earmarked a 40-percent stake in the company, based in the central-western town of Kruszwica, for up to four big investors.

Staszek said Kruszwica, whose 25 percent of shares held by the treasury will be offered to the public as of Monday, will enter the main market of the Warsaw bourse on January 6.

A 30-percent stake in the company is earmarked for its employees and suppliers while five percent will be alloted to a planned fund, which would compensate former owner for property confiscated by the former communist authorities.

Kruszwica sees its net profit at 5.4 million zlotys in 1996 and 10.5 million zlotys in 1997.

It expects sales of 472 million zlotys this year and 550.5 million next year.
