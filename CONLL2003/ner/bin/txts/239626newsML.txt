Two Canadian firms search for minerals in Albania.

TIRANA 1996-12-06

Albania has granted licenses to Canadian firms Royal Rod and Karma Mining Ltd to search for minerals in northern Albania, the mining and energy ministry said on Friday.

Ministry spokesman Astrit Karadaku told Reuters that the two companies had signed four-year contracts and would invest a total of $16 million.

"The object of their exploration is copper, gold, silver and chrome in the Tropoje region," Karadaku told Reuters.

Canadia's Nebex has been active in the same area for almost two years.

Karadaku said the companies planned to drill next spring and would hire a large number of local workers.

Albania's mineral industry is hungry for investment but so far only the chrome sector has stirred interest among foreign investors.

Germany's Preussag AG has officially made the Albania government an offer to buy 80 percent of its chrome industry for 80 million dollars.

Albania will respond after the deal, which has met opposition from the unions, has been scrutinised by an independent foreign advisor.
