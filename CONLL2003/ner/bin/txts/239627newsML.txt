Polish shares fall, seen flat next week.

WARSAW 1996-12-06

Polish shares fell on Friday after Thursday's rise and analysts said the market's month-long horizontal trend would likely last into next week amid a general lack of positive signals.

Analysts said the slightly stronger selling after price fixing on Friday signalled a possible slight fall on Monday.

"There could be a slight fall early in the week followed by a slight rise later in the week...with the week's balance either flat or slightly down," said Krzysztof Olszewski, an analyst at Bank Slaski brokerage.

Analysts said the relatively busy public offering schedule next week suggested the market could see a slight fall.

The main market's all-share WIG index fell 0.8 percent to 13,531.1 points and turnover fell 7.8 percent to 71.4 million zlotys ($25.1 million) on both markets. Losers led gainers by 55 to 15 with 13 stocks stable.

Continuous trade turnover was at 4.5 million zlotys ($1.6 million) with seven stocks down and five flat.

Mass privatisation NFI units fell 2.2 percent to 136 zlotys ($47.9) and fell 1.5 percent to 133 zlotys ($46.8) in 21.5-million-zloty ($7.6 million) continuous trade.
