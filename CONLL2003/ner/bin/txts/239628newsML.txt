WARSAW 1996-12-06

Polish construction company Budimex SA plans a merger with its former subsidary Budimex Trading and a share issue to be offered in exchange for Budimex Trading shares, Budimex said in a statement on Friday.

Budimex said it planned to issue new shares to be taken by Budimex Trading shareholders in exchange for its own registered shares. It gave no further details.

On Thursday, Kredyt Bank said it had signed an agreement on buying a 56 percent stake in Budimex Trading Sp. z o.o from its parent company, Budimex SA, for 22.4 million zlotys.

It was not immediately clear why Budimex sold the stake and then started preparations to acquire the firm.

Budimex's spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter.

"We want to merge (with Budimex Trading), all our manoeuvres serve this purpose, but I can't give any details," Irena Jagielska told Reuters.

Kredyt Bank officials were not immediately available for comment.
