Caspian group in deal, Transneft role unclear.

MOSCOW 1996-12-06

The Caspian Pipeline Consortium signed a deal on Friday under which it will split into two companies, keeping existing equity stakes intact and working under a coordinated management. It nominated Russia's Transneft as operator.

But Russian Deputy Prime Minister Valery Serov told a news conference after the signing that it was still undecided whether oil pipeline monopoly Transneft would acquire the Russian government's 24 percent stake in the consortium.  

Asked if Transneft would acquire an equity stake, Serov said: "This has not yet been decided."

Transneft Chief Executive Officer Valery Chernayev told Reuters the Fuel and Energy Ministry and the State Property Committee had signed orders in recent weeks for the Russian government to transfer its stake to Transneft.

The role of Transneft is one of the most contentious issues among CPC members and has been a focal point of negotiations.

Transneft will operate the pipeline and an equity stake could pose a conflict of interest.

Officials said the pipeline's forecast cost was $2 billion, up from previous estimates of $1.2-1.5 billion.

CPC Chevron will own 15 percent in the CPC, Russia's LUKoil  LKOH.RTS  0#LKOH.RUO 12.5 percent, Mobil and Russia's Rosneft 7.5 percent each, British Gas Plc and Italy's Agip SpA two percent each, and Oryx Energy Company and Kazakhstan's Munaigaz 1.75 percent each.

CPC is seeking to build a 1,580 km (990 mile) pipeline linking Kazakhstan's Tengiz oilfield and Russia's Black Sea oil export outlet of Novorossiisk.

The signing was attended by senior officials from each of the companies and governments.

The remaining 50 percent stake will be divided between Russia (24 percent), Kazakhstan (19 percent) and Oman, through the Oman Oil Company (seven percent).

"For tax reasons, we decided to create a CPC Russia and CPC Kazakhstan," said Edward Chow, external affairs manager for Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc. "The two entities have a different revenue stream, based on whether the oil is running through Kazakhstan or through Russia."

The group must still negotiate an operating agreement and hopes to undertake a formal share transfer in February 1997.

Officials said that they hoped construction would begin next year and that the first phase would be completed in 1999.

The pipeline will initially move 28 million tonnes a year (560,000 barrels per day) of Kazakh crude and will have a peak capacity of 67 milllion tonnes a year (1.34 million bpd).
