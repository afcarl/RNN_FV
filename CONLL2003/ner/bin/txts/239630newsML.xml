<p>Seven workers at the bankrupt Gdansk shipyard, the cradle of the Solidarity trade union, supended a hunger strike on Friday after the government signalled it may grant loan guarantees to save the firm.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a suspension and not an end of our hunger protest. We hope that the government will fulfil its public pledges of actions to save the shipyard,&quot; Solidarity said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said the seven workers, who have refused food for about 10 days, were weak and needed to be fed intravenously.</p>
<p>Treasury Minister Miroslaw Pietrewicz, who met Solidarity chairman Marian Krzaklewski on Thursday, said the government was likely to guarantee the construction of five vessels at the yard for a German investor if a bank extended a loan for the project.</p>
<p>The government will discuss the issue next week.</p>
<p>The loan, amounting to between $120 and $150 million, would keep part of the Gdansk's 5,000-strong workforce busy while the government and the yard continue to seek an investor to save the whole business.</p>
<p>The administrator of the shipyard, operating under bankruptcy regulations since August with debts of over 415 million zlotys ($148 million), is in talks with the local Bank Gdanski SA on organising a sydicated loan.</p>
<p>Gdanski has made clear that a loan could be given only to a separate company created from part of Gdansk yard's assets and not to the whole company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile about 150 workers continued to occupy Gdansk province governor's building and Solidarity was on strike alert in the region, requiring workers to be present around the clock at enterprises where the union was represented.</p>
<p>The government, dominated by an ex-communist party, has accussed the yard's previous managements of signing unprofitable contracts, under which its debts surpassed the value of the company.</p>
<p>It has also said protests in the shipyard -- where 17 years ago Lech Walesa set up Solidarity, the then Soviet bloc's first free trade union -- deter potential creditors and investors.</p>
<p>Many unionists and politicians say that the government, which has helped other state-owned enterprises, is refusing aid for the shipyard because it is a nest of political opposition.</p>
<p>Solidarity, which toppled communism in 1989, is leading an electoral bloc which hopes to defeat the co-ruling ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) in next year's ballot.</p>
