BRATISLAVA 1996-12-06

Leading Slovak shares closed steady in casual trading on the Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) on Friday, with the main action in direct trades.

The 12-share SAX index eased 0.80 point to close at 167.94.

"There is little interest, small liquidity and generally only small volumes are traded," said Dusan Sykora of ING bank.

He said he saw little change in the overall trend until the Christmas break from December 19 to January 7.

"The prices do no correspond to actual values because there are no bigger packages available," Sykora added.

Oil refiner Slovnaft, the heaviest-weighted share of the SAX index, closed 10 crowns up at 790 crowns and steelmaker VSZ gained 15 crowns to close at 500.

The biggest winner of the day was penicilin-based pharmaceuticals producer Biotika which rose by 60 crowns to 885.

Gas and oil storage company lost a further 23 to close at 1,350 crowns on continuing uncertainty over the company's future, Sykora said.

Overall volume rose to 2,194,435 shares traded, up from 249,690 on Thursday, and turnover grew to 791.18 million crowns from Thursday's 91.71 million crowns.
