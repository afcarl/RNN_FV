EBRD wants part in reviving Croatian Privredna.

ZAGREB 1996-12-06

EBRD, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, wants a role in reviving Croatia's ailing Privredna Banka Zagreb, president of the troubled bank Martin Katicic said on Friday.

"The EBRD has asked that its consultants be engaged in reviewing our restructuring plans. Their report coincides with ours," Katicic told reporters, confirming some negotiations were in progress.

But when asked whether the EBRD was considering some form of investment to boost Privredna's capital, he said it was "confidential business information" and declined to reveal any details.

Government and EBRD officials have recently said the bank is very much interested in helping Croatia overhaul its ailing and overcrowded banking sector.

A top EBRD delegation visited Privredna a month ago and was quoted as saying the bank's privatisation was a key in putting it successfully back on its feet. -- Kolumbina Bencevic, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075
