<p>Poland expects its public debt to fall as a percentage of GDP next year, a deputy finance minister said on Friday.</p>
<p>It hopes to limit public debt servicing costs next year due to a shift to longer-term financing instruments, a debt compensation deal with Russia and lower interest rates, Krzysztof Kalicki told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>He said that due to favourable market conditions, such as falling inflation and interest rates in Poland and the West, public debt should grow more slowly than the whole economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we expect the public debt to fall to 49.7 percent of GDP (gross domestic product) because the economy grows faster than the domestic and foreign debt,&quot; Kalicki said.</p>
<p>The 1997 budget bill assumes that public debt will grow to 213.5 billion zlotys next year from 192.9 billion this year but it would fall in relation to GDP from this year's expected 54 percent.</p>
<p>The debt servicing costs are expected to grow, unadjusted for inflation, to 17.9 billion zlotys in 1997 from 15.1 billion forecast for this year.</p>
<p>Kalicki said an October agreement with Russia on a reduction of mutual debts, dating back mainly to the communist era, would cut Poland's debt by about $2.3 billion.</p>
<p>He also said an expected fall in interest rates on main international markets and favourable cross-currency rates would help slash foreign debt servicing costs by an additional $50 million.</p>
<p>Kalicki said the finance ministry expected to cut costs of domestic debt servicing by shifting its financing to longer-term T-bills and bonds and taking advantage of an expected fall in interest rates.</p>
<p>He said that after this week's T-bill tender the longest 52-week paper accounted for 80.2 percent of the value of all T-bills held by investors.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect that with falling inflation interest rates will be also falling,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The budget draft aims at slashing inflation to 13 percent at the end of 1997 from 19.5 percent in October 1996, while maintaining robust 5.5 percent economic growth.</p>
<p>But the central bank has signalled it would keep its official lombard and discount rates, now at 25 and 22 percent respectively, unchanged to allow real rates to grow, in a bid to cap too rapid credit expansion.</p>
<p>Senior central bankers have even hinted last month a rate rise could not be ruled out if monetary growth remained too strong.</p>
<p>But Kalicki said the ministry expected mounting market pressure and the risk of heavy inflows of short-term foreign capital would eventually force the central bank to ease its grip on rates.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe in market forces -- one cannot ignore where rates are in other countries...and forgetting about it leads to a much too strong flow of short-term capital,&quot; Kalicki said.</p>
<p>Kalicki added the ministry for the time being did not plan to limit foreign access to Polish T-bills and saw no immediate threat from the inflow of short-term capital even though rising real interest rates might call for a cut in interest rates later next year.</p>
