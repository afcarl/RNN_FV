Russian shares ease on Greenspan comments.

MOSCOW 1996-12-06

Leading Russian shares fell on Friday, following the lead of European markets which eased after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned against "irrational exuberance" in financial markets.

The Russian Trading System index of 24 shares fell by 2.58 percent to 185.25 on $12.85 million in volume.

Greenspan, speaking at a dinner in Washington on Thursday night, said the Fed had to beware of "irrational exuberance" infecting financial markets which could end up damaging the economy.

European markets fell strongly on Friday after the statement and the Russian market dominated by Western investors had to follow, traders said.

"It was the main push down for Russia," said Dmitry Starenko, chief trader at Regent European Securities. "It has been falling with a purpose."

But the market stabilised by the evening and demand for leading shares such as Mosenergo and UES appeared, Starenko said.

UES fell to $0.0828 from $0.0845 at Thursday's close, Mosenergo ticked down to $0.970 after $0.981.

A trader from IK Aton said the midday fall was on low volumes and a vacuum of buyers led the fall rather than concerted selling.

"We could not see sellers, but there were no buyers, either," he said.

Parliament's stormy debate of the 1997 draft budget made little impact on the Western investors distracted by events at home, traders said.

The Duma voted to delay a decision on the budget until Sunday December 15, which is a working day in Russia.

Finance Minister Alexander Livshits' Friday comments that Norilsk Nickel had to pay overdue taxes pushed down shares of the metals group, which have been languishing, Starenko said.

Irkutskenergo edged down to $0.1210 from $0.1268 and Norilsk Nickel dropped $5.17 after $5.57.
