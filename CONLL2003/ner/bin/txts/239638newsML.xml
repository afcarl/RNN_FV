<title>RUSSIA: Russian shares ease on Greenspan comments.</title>

<p>Leading Russian shares fell on Friday, following the lead of European markets which eased after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned against &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in financial markets.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System index of 24 shares fell by 2.58 percent to 185.25 on $12.85 million in volume.</p>
<p>Greenspan, speaking at a dinner in Washington on Thursday night, said the Fed had to beware of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infecting financial markets which could end up damaging the economy.</p>
<p>European markets fell strongly on Friday after the statement and the Russian market dominated by Western investors had to follow, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the main push down for Russia,&quot; said Dmitry Starenko, chief trader at Regent European Securities. &quot;It has been falling with a purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>But the market stabilised by the evening and demand for leading shares such as Mosenergo and UES appeared, Starenko said.</p>
<p>UES fell to $0.0828 from $0.0845 at Thursday's close, Mosenergo ticked down to $0.970 after $0.981.</p>
<p>A trader from IK Aton said the midday fall was on low volumes and a vacuum of buyers led the fall rather than concerted selling.</p>
<p>&quot;We could not see sellers, but there were no buyers, either,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Parliament's stormy debate of the 1997 draft budget made little impact on the Western investors distracted by events at home, traders said.</p>
<p>The Duma voted to delay a decision on the budget until Sunday December 15, which is a working day in Russia.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Alexander Livshits' Friday comments that Norilsk Nickel had to pay overdue taxes pushed down shares of the metals group, which have been languishing, Starenko said.</p>
<p>Irkutskenergo edged down to $0.1210 from $0.1268 and Norilsk Nickel dropped $5.17 after $5.57.</p>
