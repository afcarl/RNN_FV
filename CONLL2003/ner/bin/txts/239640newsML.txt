BELGRADE 1996-12-06

Yugoslavia's largest agricultural corporation PKB said on Friday it will buy 20 heavy Massey Ferguson tractors worth $2 million.

Ferguson tractors will be on PKB fields within 90 days.

"This is a very important deal for us, because PKB machinery is 12-15 years old and if we do not obtain new equipment, it will be difficult to successfully revive agricultural production," PKB president Vojislav Simanovic told reporters.

Simanovic stressed Yugoslavia urgently needed 400 heavy tractors (200 horse power each) which are not produced by local factories. "Without the new machinery, there will be no future for the Yugoslav agriculture."

Serbian deputy agriculture minister Goran Petkovic said this was a good start to eliminate bottlenecks in the country's agriculture.

Massey Ferguson, a unit of LucasVarity offered a five-year credit line with 8 percent annual interest. The credit line is arranged with the backing of the largest Yugoslav commercial bank Beobanka.
