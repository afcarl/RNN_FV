<p>The Slovak central bank (NBS) on Friday warned that the government's planned expansive 1997 budget, currently being debated in parliament, could make refinancing the budget deficit a problem.</p>
<p>&quot;The expansive budget plans, if carried out, will reduce the amount of investment into the economy and, with regard to the current liquid capacity of commercial banks and the NBS monetary policy, may bring problems with refinancing the budget deficit,&quot; National Bank of Slovakia spokesman Jan Onda told Reuters.</p>
<p>The government has proposed a 1997 state budget with the expected revenues of 170 billion crowns and expenditures of 206.9 billion. The planned deficit is 36.9 billion crowns versus a forecast 26.95 billion crown shortfall in 1996.</p>
<p>Parliament's budget debate may end as early as Friday evening, when it could be immediately passed.</p>
<p>Onda said the government should be more cautious in its development programmes as the import burden of some projects was exceeding their effectiveness. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>The government's development programmes for next year include 14 billion crowns for motorway construction and multi-billion crown government guarantees for the modernisation of the state-run railway system and hydro-construction projects.</p>
<p>The finance ministry, using Treasury bills and state bonds as the main tool to refinance the budget deficit, plans issues of an overall volume of some 70 billion crowns next year to cover deficit shortfalls in 1996 and 1997.</p>
<p>The finance ministry has been accepting higher yields to refinance the state budget deficit, which widened sharply to 13.4 billion crowns for the first nine months of 1996 from 7.9 billion in the first eight months.</p>
<p>Average yield on Finance Ministry T-bills hit 11.94 percent on Wednesday, up from 11.25 percent in last week's offering, and 9.3 percent a month ago. Market analysts predicted yields may rise to over 12 percent.</p>
<p>The central bank has said that the current T-bill yields were high, but sufficient for successful state budget deficit refinancing though the market.</p>
<p>It added that its participation in helping finance the state budget was limited, and it would only do so to prevent interest rates from rising.</p>
