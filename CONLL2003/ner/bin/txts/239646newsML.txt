PRAGUE 1996-12-06

Trading activity on the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) surged on Friday but the main indices fell led by major issues.

The PX50 index posted its first fall in seven sessions, declining by more than one percent to 515.4 while the RPIX index of continuously traded shares fell 13.8 points to 1,060.9.

During continuous trading SPIF Cesky again dominated, rising 11 crowns to 431 and accounting for 76 million crowns of the session's record total turnover of 105 million.

Interest in SPIF has risen sharply since rumours emerged that the company was considering changing its status to that of an open ended fund. SPIF is currently a closed end fund.

Dealers said the discount between net asset value and the current share price was narrowing and saw potential for further growth in forthcoming sessions.

"Definitely it is trading at around a 20 percent discount and it is quite likely that this discount will be wiped out," said Lubomir Vystavel of ING Barings.

Elsewhere, the major issues were generally down. CEZ lost 24 crowns to 965, Komercni Banka fell 55 crowns to 2,045 and SPT Telecom dropped 65 crowns to 3,065.

Turnover rose to 3.9 billion crowns.
