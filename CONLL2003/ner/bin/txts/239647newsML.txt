Weekly turnover up on Romania OTC market.

BUCHAREST 1996-12-06

Data issued by Romania's RASDAQ over-the-counter (OTC) trading system on Friday showed five- day turnover this week had soared to some 486 million lei from 351 million a week ago.

A RASDAQ report showed the market had 529 listings, up from 344 at the end of last week.

The RASDAQ opened late in October under a capital market project run by the U.S. Agency for International Development.

Traders said though listings outnumbered traded stocks by far, the OTC market promised to gain ground in the near future as more companies would join in trading.

The largest number of traded stocks this week was 37 on Wednesday, with the lowest level -- 28 stocks -- on Monday.

The OTC system is expected eventually to trade shares in 5,000 companies, most of them privatised under a mass selloff which gave 15 million Romanians shares in exchange for coupons.

"Daily turnover on the OTC equals the stock exchange level on a good day in its past," said a trader.

The bourse, opened last November, has been sluggish in recent months, with brokers saying share liquidity squeezes were preventing a higher activity. The bourse has 17 listings.

IMEP SA electric motor maker in Pitesti, 117 km (65 miles) west of Bucharest, was the week's most heavily traded company, taking the bulk of OTC trading on four days.

On Friday IMEP closed at 650 lei, unchanged from Monday. ($=3,617 lei) -- Luli Popescu, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264
