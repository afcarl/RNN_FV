<title>ROMANIA: Weekly turnover up on Romania OTC market.</title>
<headline>Weekly turnover up on Romania OTC market.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Data issued by Romania's RASDAQ over-the-counter (OTC) trading system on Friday showed five- day turnover this week had soared to some 486 million lei from 351 million a week ago.</p>
<p>A RASDAQ report showed the market had 529 listings, up from 344 at the end of last week.</p>
<p>The RASDAQ opened late in October under a capital market project run by the U.S. Agency for International Development.</p>
<p>Traders said though listings outnumbered traded stocks by far, the OTC market promised to gain ground in the near future as more companies would join in trading.</p>
<p>The largest number of traded stocks this week was 37 on Wednesday, with the lowest level -- 28 stocks -- on Monday.</p>
<p>The OTC system is expected eventually to trade shares in 5,000 companies, most of them privatised under a mass selloff which gave 15 million Romanians shares in exchange for coupons.</p>
<p>&quot;Daily turnover on the OTC equals the stock exchange level on a good day in its past,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>The bourse, opened last November, has been sluggish in recent months, with brokers saying share liquidity squeezes were preventing a higher activity. The bourse has 17 listings.</p>
<p>IMEP SA electric motor maker in Pitesti, 117 km (65 miles) west of Bucharest, was the week's most heavily traded company, taking the bulk of OTC trading on four days.</p>
<p>On Friday IMEP closed at 650 lei, unchanged from Monday. ($=3,617 lei) -- Luli Popescu, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264</p>
