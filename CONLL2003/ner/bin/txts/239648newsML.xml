<headline>Hungary forint ends down vs dlr after speculation.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hungary's forint closed easier against the dollar as the mark also dropped versus the U.S. unit, dealers said.</p>
<p>The forint closed at 159.30/40, compared with its opening of 159.99/160.20.</p>
<p>The forint opened 50 pips weaker than the National Bank of Hungary's resistance level (bid). The gap widened to around one forint by 0915 on foreign currency buying which some dealers called speculative, but returned to 50 fillers by the closing.</p>
<p>&quot;Liquidity was low, there were only a few banks on the market,&quot; said WestLB Hungaria's Balazs Benczedi.  </p>
<p>Dealers added that demand for foreign currencies had been strengthened by buying from banking clients who sought to repay their foreign currency loans, as forint credit and deposit interest rates have fallen rapidly.</p>
<p>Most dollar futures on the Budapest Commodity Exchange fell, by 50 fillers to 1.47 forints. The mark firmed for two maturities, by 25 and 30 fillers. The Ecu closed mixed.</p>
