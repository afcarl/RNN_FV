<p>For the Soviet people, the fall of the Iron Curtain meant freedom to travel abroad for the first time. But the break-up of the Soviet Union five years ago this weekend has created new frontiers, too.</p>
<p>Where once there was a monolithic state stretching from the Pacific to the Black Sea, there are now 15 not always friendly neighbours, each with its regiments of frontier guards and unwelcoming tangles of red tape and customs duties.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), set up by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his Ukrainian and Belarussian counterparts at Belovezhskaya Pushcha in Belarus on December 8, 1991, now comprises 12 of the 15 -- the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania refused to join.</p>
<p>As a successor to the Soviet Union, its supporters see it developing into an economic and trading community of open borders along the lines of the European Union.</p>
<p>A simple journey across part of the CIS last weekend provided ample evidence that that goal is a long way off.</p>
<p>What should have been a two-hour flight from Moscow to the old Soviet Union's southwestern corner, the republic of Moldova, turned into a day-long nightmare of bureaucratic bullying, sleeplessness and hunger after an unscheduled stop in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Fog in the Moldovan capital Chisinau -- it was known as Kishinyov in Soviet times -- prevented us landing after our flight from Moscow on Air Moldova -- one of hundreds of &quot;babyflots&quot; created when Soviet carrier Aeroflot was broken up.</p>
<p>The Tupolev pilot cut his losses and headed for the nearest open airport -- the Black Sea port of Odessa, in Ukraine, just 150 km (95 miles) from Chisinau. The passengers set to discussing how to finish our journey by bus, train or taxi.</p>
<p>It was naive. The CIS had us ensnared and we would not see Moldova -- or food or the outside of our airliner -- for a day.</p>
<p>First, completing the journey by road was more complex than at first sight since, while Moldova and Ukraine are neighbours, the eastern part of Moldova declared itself independent in 1990.</p>
<p>Dnestr, as it is known, is not recognised by any other government. But that does not stop the region, Russian-speaking and hostile to Moldova's Romanian-speaking majority, creating two extra frontiers between Odessa and Chisinau. And they are manned by armed guards determined to extract customs duties.</p>
<p>Resigned to a night in Odessa, we contemplated the airport's facilities -- most pressingly where to find a meal and a drink.</p>
<p>Again, we spoke too soon. Ukrainian border guards, recognisable by the green cap-bands common to their kind across most of the CIS -- told the passengers, many of whom were small-time traders, their baggage would be taken from the hold.</p>
<p>Horrified at the prospect of yet more customs officers trawling through their goods, many refused. Despite a plea from the captain to give in -- &quot;Please comply. We are in a foreign country and must do as they say&quot; -- the result was stalemate.</p>
<p>The frontier troops simply sealed the doors and placed armed guards on the runway -- in case we should make a break for it.</p>
<p>The passengers accepted their fate with classic Russian patience. No one wondered why the CIS was not working for them.</p>
<p>Ironically, the only sign that these were once all Soviet citizens came when the Ukrainian frontier guards demanded, &quot;Any foreigners here?&quot; For the Bangladeshi, Chinese and Briton on board, it was obvious he meant them. No one else replied.</p>
<p>For us, customs or no customs, there was no way out. Without Ukrainian visas, we were not to be allowed to set foot on Odessa's tarmac whatever the other passengers decided.</p>
