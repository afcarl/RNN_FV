Bulgarian lev ends at new low, off 30 pct in week.

SOFIA 1996-12-06

Bulgaria's lev ended at a new record low of 469-473 per dollar in thin volume, down from 435-450 in the morning and off some 30 percent in the week because foreign currency demand heavily outweighed supply, dealers said.

"Trade was virtually non-existent in the afternoon because most banks withdrew from the market after the lev sank to 470, and dollar supply almost disappeared," a commercial bank dealer said.

Fuel and energy importers continued bidding for relatively large foreign currency volumes on Friday, but supply was very low and came only from a limited number of commercial banks, traders said.

The central bank (BNB) was not seen selling dollars on the interbank market to prop up the lev, dealers said.

BNB officials were not available for comment.

The lev traded at 362-364 on Monday.

Foreign currency demand from energy importers has been pressuring the lev amid low supply this week with the BNB unable to halt the lev's fall with large-scale interventions because of a drop in its foreign exchange reserves, dealers said.

The BNB said last month it would aim to preserve reserves for a possible introduction of a tight monetary regime, called a currency board system, which means levs in circulation must be matched by the amount of forex reserves.

Reserves fell to $525 million at the end of November from $541 million a month earlier. Reserves stood at 1.41 billion in November 1995. -- Anastas Petrov, Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-876032
