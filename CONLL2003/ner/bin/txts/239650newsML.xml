<p>Bulgaria's lev ended at a new record low of 469-473 per dollar in thin volume, down from 435-450 in the morning and off some 30 percent in the week because foreign currency demand heavily outweighed supply, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade was virtually non-existent in the afternoon because most banks withdrew from the market after the lev sank to 470, and dollar supply almost disappeared,&quot; a commercial bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Fuel and energy importers continued bidding for relatively large foreign currency volumes on Friday, but supply was very low and came only from a limited number of commercial banks, traders said.</p>
<p>The central bank (BNB) was not seen selling dollars on the interbank market to prop up the lev, dealers said.</p>
<p>BNB officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>The lev traded at 362-364 on Monday.</p>
<p>Foreign currency demand from energy importers has been pressuring the lev amid low supply this week with the BNB unable to halt the lev's fall with large-scale interventions because of a drop in its foreign exchange reserves, dealers said.</p>
<p>The BNB said last month it would aim to preserve reserves for a possible introduction of a tight monetary regime, called a currency board system, which means levs in circulation must be matched by the amount of forex reserves.</p>
<p>Reserves fell to $525 million at the end of November from $541 million a month earlier. Reserves stood at 1.41 billion in November 1995. -- Anastas Petrov, Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-876032</p>
