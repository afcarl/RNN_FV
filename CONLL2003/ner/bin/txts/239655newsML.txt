Tractebel may pull out of Hungary plant - report.

BUDAPEST 1996-12-06

Belgian utility Tractebel was reported on Friday to be looking to sell back its stake in a Hungarian power station after the Hungarian government announced January energy price rises below its expectations.

The Hungarian daily Nepszabadsag quotes trade union sources as saying Tractebel had hired a New York-based legal firm to represent it in talks with the Hungarian government intended to persuade it to buy back Tractebel's 48.7 percent stake in the Dunamenti power plant.

The Belgians are believed to be unhappy about the government's decision to allow utilities to increase retail electricity prices by 24.9 percent from January, a hike which was postponed from October.

They believe this will not allow them an eight-per-cent profit on invested assets from January which was promised them when they bought the stake from Hungarian privatisation agency APV last year for 141 million dollars.

The article quotes Tractebel's representative in Hungary Tibor Kuhl as saying the firm had not decided its next step.

"The lawyers are looking into the situation, which in their opinion in the case of Dunamenti power station is extremely serious," Kuhl is quoted as saying.

Tractebel was one of a number of West European utilities, including RWE and Electricite de France, which paid a total of around $2 billion at the end of last year for stakes in Hungary's energy sector in the biggest utility sell-off of any post-Communist state.

Officials at Tractebel were unavailable for comment on Friday.
