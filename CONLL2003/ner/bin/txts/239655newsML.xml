<p>Belgian utility Tractebel was reported on Friday to be looking to sell back its stake in a Hungarian power station after the Hungarian government announced January energy price rises below its expectations.</p>
<p>The Hungarian daily Nepszabadsag quotes trade union sources as saying Tractebel had hired a New York-based legal firm to represent it in talks with the Hungarian government intended to persuade it to buy back Tractebel's 48.7 percent stake in the Dunamenti power plant.</p>
<p>The Belgians are believed to be unhappy about the government's decision to allow utilities to increase retail electricity prices by 24.9 percent from January, a hike which was postponed from October.</p>
<p>They believe this will not allow them an eight-per-cent profit on invested assets from January which was promised them when they bought the stake from Hungarian privatisation agency APV last year for 141 million dollars.</p>
<p>The article quotes Tractebel's representative in Hungary Tibor Kuhl as saying the firm had not decided its next step.</p>
<p>&quot;The lawyers are looking into the situation, which in their opinion in the case of Dunamenti power station is extremely serious,&quot; Kuhl is quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Tractebel was one of a number of West European utilities, including RWE and Electricite de France, which paid a total of around $2 billion at the end of last year for stakes in Hungary's energy sector in the biggest utility sell-off of any post-Communist state.</p>
<p>Officials at Tractebel were unavailable for comment on Friday.</p>
