<title>HUNGARY: Budapest bourse joins tumbling European markets.</title>

<p>Hungarian share prices tumbled on Friday as they followed the underlying trend on most European exchanges.</p>
<p>The BUX index, reversing from three successive record highs, closed at 3,714.59 points, down 88.86.</p>
<p>The market's fall was a result of the dollar's drop, triggered by a speech of U.S. Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan who warned that &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stock and other asset markets, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the mirror of performance of other European markets, our performance came as no surprise at all,&quot; said Geza Raner of Bank Austria-GiroCredit Befektetesi Rt.</p>
<p>However, the overheated state of the Hungarian market has also contributed.</p>
<p>&quot;Our market has been at highs and many (market players) were guessing when it reaches its end,&quot; Raner said. &quot;These two factors made their impact on the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Raner, just like other traders earlier today, noted that the latter part of Thursday's trading already heralded corrections to come.</p>
<p>Traders said that today's price fall occurred suddenly and prices stabilised at the lower levels for most of the day.</p>
<p>Support from the U.S. jobless figures came too late to help the Budapest bourse rebound from its lows before it closed.</p>
<p>Heavy losers of the day included retailer Fotex which fell 10 forints or 10 percent to close at 90; OTP Bank which fell dropped 125 forints to close at 2,545.</p>
<p>The two chemicals giants, TVK and Borsodchem, fell 2.76 percent to 1,585 forints and 2.74 percent to 3,550 forints, respectively. Although in early trade TVK bucked the trend and rose to a new all-time high of 1,650.</p>
