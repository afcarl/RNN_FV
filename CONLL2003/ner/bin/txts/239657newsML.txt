Russian parliament to vote on budget on Dec 15.

MOSCOW 1996-12-06

The lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma, voted on Friday to delay a decision on the 1997 budget draft until Sunday December 15.

The Duma had been expected to vote on Friday.  

Deputies spent Friday in a heated debate on the draft, which had been prepared by a conciliatory commission after the Duma rejected the original government's spending plan in October.

The communist and some other opposition factions slammed the draft, which was defended by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his ministers.

But they appeared to be running out of steam by the end of the day and voted by 331 to 29 to support the proposal to delay the vote, which was drafted by ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky.

"Why do we have to be in a hurry?" Zhirinovsky said. "A holiday will pass (the December 12 Constitution Day), people will get some rest and calm down."
