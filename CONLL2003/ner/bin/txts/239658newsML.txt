Croatan stocks close lower, no recovery in sight.

ZAGREB 1996-12-06

Croatian stocks closed lower on Friday in lazy trade with chocolate-maker Kras sticking out as the sole gainer, and traders said an immediate recovery was not yet in sight.

"We expect the prices to stabilise in the next two months and trading to pick up again towards spring," said Velimir Zelimorski of Fima brokerage.

Most Croatian shares are traded at the levels of six months ago. But despite attractive prices, the interest of buyers is limited at best, Zelimorski said.

"This shows just how bad the situation is," he said.

Most traders blame the sudden fall in interest on political instability in the country whose economic performance in 1996 and the outlook for 1997 do not warrant such pessimism.

Mass demonstrations in protest over the government's attempt to shut down an independent radio and serious health problems of President Franjo Tudjman in November scared foreign investors away and made local market participants extremely cautious.

In a slow trade, usual for Fridays, the volume was halved at 2,393 shares while turnover fell to 1.4 million kuna from 4.8 million the day before. Total weekly turnover was five times higher at 29 million from kuna.

Seven of eight active issues fell and one rose.

Istrian hotelier Riviera, one of the hits of the last autumn's bull run, fell back to 106 kuna -- the lowest level in months. Another tourist firm Laguna, also from Porec, lost 25 kuna to close at 1,025.

Even the two top listings, drug firm Pliva and the leading Croatian commercial bank Zagrebacka Banka, which managed to resist the downward trend of the past three weeks, edged down on Friday.

Pliva lost 1,015 kuna to close at 12,005, on 15 shares traded.

The most actively traded was Zagrebacka, which fell 10 kuna to 990 on 815 shares sold.

The only gainer Kras rose 20 kuna to close at 430, selling 724 shares.
