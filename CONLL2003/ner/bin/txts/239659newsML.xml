<p>Prices of Russian MinFin bonds eased on uncertainty whether parliament would approve the 1997 budget and following the downward trend in U.S. Treasuries, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>		 tranche  Dec 6		   Dec 5</p>
<p> 1999 maturity (3)    83.30-83.60	   83.70-84.00</p>
<p> 2003 maturity (4)    59.20-59.50	   59.80-60.10</p>
<p> 2008 maturity (5)    41.20-41.50	   41.90-42.20</p>
<p> 2006 maturity (6)    47.60-47.90	   48.30-48.60</p>
<p> 2011 maturity (7)    35.35-35.65	   35.30-35.60</p>
<p>Russia's lower parliament chamber is currently discussing the 1997 budget plan, with more or less equal number of deputies criticising and defending the government's draft.</p>
<p>&quot;People are not sure the budget will be approved today. All Russian instruments have gone down today for this reason and following the U.S. Treasury fall,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Treasury bond prices and many emerging debt markets were hit by an inflation warning on Thurday from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said irrational exuberance in asset markets could damage the economy.</p>
<p>Dealers said further moves would depend today on market reaction to the 118,000 rise in U.S. November non-farm payrolls, which cut early losses on U.S. Treasury bonds.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is in downward trend but it is not as violent as in Vnesh loans. MinFins are down but not very sharply and finding support,&quot; Eurobank dealer Olivier Coursault said.</p>
<p>He added some banks were selling papers feeling shortage of cash which they need to close positions in year-end.</p>
<p>Dealers said tranches III to VII were meeting support at 83.30, 59.20, 41.20, 47.60 and 35.00 respectively.</p>
