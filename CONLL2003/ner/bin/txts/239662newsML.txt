PRAGUE 1996-12-06

Czech steelmill Nova Hut a.s. said on Friday it would raise $350 million through direct and syndicated loans from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Czech Komercni Banka a.s..

Lumir Kuchar, assistant to the general director, told Reuters the funding will be used for the firm's $650 million minimill project.

"One of the sources is a loan directly from the IFC, second is a syndicated loan led by the IFC, the third part is a syndicated loan (managed by) Komercni Banka through Czech banks," Kuchar said.

He said members of the syndicates would be known in January, while contracts should be signed in February.

Kuchar did not give exact terms of the credits, except to say they would be "long-term".

The company intends to finance the rest of the investment from its own sources, said Kuchar.
