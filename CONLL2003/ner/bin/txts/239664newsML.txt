Croatian lending rate slips to 9.4 percent.

ZAGREB 1996-11-06

Croatia's money market average rate edged down to 9.4 from 9.7 percent due to growing supply of kuna funds. Trade totalled 47.4 million kuna of which 15 million accounted for fresh borrowings, against 57 million on offer.

Dealers said demand for fresh kuna loans could not be met in full, as lenders and borrowers failed to agree on terms. New loans were granted at a steady call money rate of 9.0 percent. One 10-day loan was struck at 10 percent. Insurers rolled over previous loans at 9.2 percent.

The price for term loans ranged between 10 percent for short-term loans and 21 percent for two-month funds. State bank HBOR rolled over money at 8.5 percent rate.

Thursday's overnight trade, described by dealers as lively, totalled 47.8 million kuna, compared to 330,000 kuna a day earlier. Two banks demanded 5.3 million to square their positions, while other banks borrowed 42.5 million to maintain their mandatory reserves.

The central bank calculated its kuna midrates for the weekend and Monday slightly weaker at 5.4798 against the dollar and firmer at 3.5599 versus the German mark. -- Laura Lui, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075
