<p>Beer exports from British brewer Bass Plc's Czech unit, Prazske Pivovary a.s. (PP) surged in 1996 and are likely to reach 295,000 hectolitres by the end of the year, a senior Bass official said on Friday.</p>
<p>Mervyn Childs, Bass country manager for the Czech Republic, said exports of PP's lager-type Staropramen brand had risen by over 60 percent compared with 1995 and had almost trebled since 1994 when the company exported just 109,000 hectolitres.</p>
<p>&quot;We're well on the way to the half million, five year target that I set ourselves three years ago...And we're now looking at a target of 750,000 hectolitres...(by) the year 2,001,&quot; said Childs.</p>
<p>In 1993, Bass took a 34 percent stake in PP for nine million pounds and has progressively increased its stake to the current 51 percent.</p>
<p>Drawing on the Czech Republic's reputation as the home of the Pilsner brewing method and some of the most-famous beers in the world, Bass has pushed hard into lucrative foreign markets, especially in Britain and Germany.</p>
<p>Industry analysts say exports will gradually acquire a greater significance for Czech brewers as domestic consumption falls in line with the growth in the range of alternative beverages and the general rise in living standards.</p>
<p>Czechs are, per capita, the largest beer drinking nation in the world.</p>
<p>Childs said he would like to see up to a quarter of PP's production going abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;When we came here our exports were about seven percent of our production but this year they are going to be up to 14 or 15 percent of our production and I won't be happy until they're 20 to 25 percent,&quot; said Childs.</p>
<p>The Czech beer industry as a whole currently exports around 1.5 million hectolitres of beer annually compared with seven million from neighbouring Germany whose export volumes, Childs said, the Czech Republic should be aiming to emulate.</p>
<p>Apart from west European markets such as Britain, Germany and Italy, Bass is also building its market share in Russia, Ukraine and former federation partner Slovakia, while mulling over possibilities in the far east.</p>
<p>&quot;I really do see some fantastic opportunities out there for the Czech beer industry not just for Staropramen,&quot; said Childs.</p>
