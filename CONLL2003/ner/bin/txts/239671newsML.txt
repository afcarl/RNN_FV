Romania 91-day T-bills issue oversubscribed.

BUCHAREST 1996-12-06

An issue of three-month Romanian treasury bills worth 500 billion lei was oversubscribed on Friday, central bank data showed.

The bills, offering an annual rate of 51.44 percent and maturing next March 7, were bought by 11 banks who entered total bids worth 643.2 billion lei.

In recent months, the Finance Ministry has launched several issues of 91-day T-bills to cover a soaring state budget gap.

The ministry's paper is placed by the central bank in public subscriptions and can be bought by commercial banks operating in Romania and their corporate clients.

Traders said the banks rushed to buy T-bills as the money market continued to be overliquid in the leu currency.

Latest statistics show the state budget had a 10-month deficit of 2.86 trillion lei. That gap is expected to widen to 4.2 trillion lei by end-1996. ($=3,617 lei) -- Luli Popescu, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264
