Russian architect of 1991 CIS pact admits regrets.

The man seen by many as the architect of the pact which consigned the Soviet Union to the dustbin of history five years ago says it was a job well done -- but admits he made some mistakes.

Gennady Burbulis, viewed by his opponents as Boris Yeltsin's evil genius during his rise to power, was at the zenith of his influence in December 1991.

Now an ordinary member of the Russian parliament, the Duma, Burbulis says it is too early to write his memoirs. But he is quick to defend his role in the agreement which formalised the breakup of the Soviet Union.

"The Soviet Union had already disappeared," Burbulis told Reuters in an interview on Friday about the meeting in the Belarussian nature reserve of Belovezhskaya Pushcha on December 8, 1991.

"We were recognising formally the reality in which we were all living since the August coup," he said, referring to a failed attempt by hardliners to depose Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that year.

"This disintegration had become irreversible."

After months of inconclusive negotiations on the future shape of the Soviet Union chaired by Gorbachev, Yeltsin met the leaders of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich of Belarus, leaving Gorbachev behind in Moscow.

In little over 24 hours of brainstorming, they declared that the Soviet Union no longer existed either legally or in fact and agreed to set up the Commonwealth of Independent States instead.

Burbulis told Reuters that Yeltsin agreed to this only after Kravchuk, buoyed by a 90 percent referendum vote in Ukraine in favour of complete independence, ruled out other options such as a confederation.

"We arrived with background materials but we had no draft agreement on the creation of the CIS prepared in advance," Burbulis said. "The agreement was born on the spot."

Burbulis, a liberal reformer, was first deputy premier under Yeltsin in 1991-92 but was later sacrificed by the president and finally fell out of favour altogether.

Today he defends the 1991 agreement as the only sensible way forward.  "We found a formula which ensured that the breakup of the Soviet Union took place with the minimum of losses and upheavals," he said.

"It was not the work of a group of conspirators. It is naive to think that we could cause the collapse of a huge empire with nuclear weapons with the signature of six people on a piece of paper."

However he acknowledges that not everything worked out as planned, especially between Russia and Ukraine who are still arguing five years later over the Black Sea Fleet, and the Crimean port of Sevastopol where it is based.

"It was our mistake that at the time we did not record Sevastopol, the Black Sea Fleet and Crimea as problems to be negotiated separately," he said.

Burbulis said Russia did not anticipate Ukraine's immediate takeover of all Soviet forces on its territory. "We believed there would be joint armed forces for a period of five or seven years," he said.

Yeltsin's former aide considers the breakup of the state was a "heavy price we had to pay" for the collapse of the communist regime. "We felt no exhilaration," he said.

He now thinks integration between Russia and its close neighbours has a future, but only on a pragmatic economic basis.

And he is highly critical of Belarus's authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko, who has pledged to bring his small country back into Moscow's embrace.

"I think Lukashenko is exploiting in the most cruel way the desire to get back together. He is not the creator of union but its destroyer. He has no principles and is pathologically devoted to repressive ways of exercising power," Burbulis said.

"It is inevitable that Russia and Belarus will come closer together but it will not happen with Lukashenko there."
