Sale of stake in Latvian Gas may be set back.

RIGA 1996-12-06

The Latvian Privatisation Agency (LPA) is expected next week to postpone for a second time a deal to sell shares in Latvian Gas as Germany's Preussen and Ruhrgas are worried over the company's 50 million lat debts.

Ruhrgas and Preussen have joined to buy shares in Latvian Gas with Russia's Gazprom. The deadline for signing the deal is December 15, already postponed from October.

"Next week we can expect the Privatization Agency board to decide on the postponement of the deadline for subscribtion to Latvian Gas shares," an LPA official told Reuters, confirming a report in Dienas Bizness newspaper.

Officials said the new deadline could be February 15.

One of the major stumbling blocks has been the Latvian government position on the bad debts of the energy companies caused by non-payments by both industrial and private consumers.

According to current rules bad debts cannot be written off without paying tax on the sums not collected.

Ruhrgas is also currently examining both the Latvian goverment draft licence on natural gas companies as well as the draft statutes of a public company, the officials added.

Dienas Bizness said the German firms wanted government guarantees for the bad debts.

Ruhrgas/Preussen and Gazprom are expected to buy some 32 percent of Latvian Gas shares.
