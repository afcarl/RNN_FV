<p>Doctors performed an emergency tracheotomy to help Czech President Vaclav Havel breathe after cancer surgery on his lungs earlier this week, a spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>He said that the procedure to insert a device into Havel's throat, done after his breathing worsened on Thursday, had helped, and the president's condition significantly improved.  </p>
<p>&quot;A worsening in the president's lung functions took place yesterday,&quot; presidential spokesman Ladlislav Spacek said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;A tracheotomy was performed and supportive breathing was installed through the help of a breathing device,&quot; he said. &quot;After these steps, the president's condition signigicantly improved.&quot;</p>
<p>Havel has been recovering from surgery on Monday which removed a small malignant tumour and half of his right lung. Doctors after the operation said that they had caught the cancer early, and that Havel could fully recover from the surgery within six weeks.</p>
<p>His spokesman said on Thursday that Havel, 60 and a heavy smoker, had also developed a slight case of pneumonia in the left lung.</p>
