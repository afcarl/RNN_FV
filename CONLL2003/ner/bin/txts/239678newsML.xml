<p>A controversial business tycoon who has joined Russia's efforts to end fighting in rebel Chechnya said on Friday that Moscow appeared finally to have won the trust of the rebel leaders.</p>
<p>Boris Berezovsky, who completed his rise from car dealer to Kremlin politician in October, indicated after his latest mission to Chechnya that the chances of a lasting peace were better than at any time since the conflict flared two years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel that the Chechen leaders now have much more trust in Russia and the federal government, and it already helps us a lot,&quot; Berezovsky, 50, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Berezovsky, the deputy secretary of President Boris Yeltsin's influential Security Council, struck an optimistic note one day after returning from Chechnya.</p>
<p>He said the trip, accompanying Security Council secretary Ivan Rybkin, had been crowned by the opening of Grozny's airport for the first regular civilian flights for months and the installation of a satellite telephone system.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that in a very short time, every citizen of Chechnya will feel the result of the peace process in his home,&quot; Berezovsky said.</p>
<p>The many people made homeless in almost 21 months of fighting are less optimistic. Despite a peace deal signed on August 31, they remain bitter after the deaths of tens of thousands of people, most of them civilians.</p>
<p>Russian bombing raids have destroyed many buildings, road and rail links are badly in need of repair and reconstruction work has hardly even begun.</p>
<p>Berezovsky said the Russian government had made many mistakes during the fighting.</p>
<p>But he defended Yeltsin and suggested the reason for the separatists' new trust was the president's announcement last month that he was withdrawing the last of the troops which he sent to the mountainous southern region on December 11, 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;For the first time, this was a step which was not taken under pressure,&quot; Berezovsky said.</p>
<p>&quot;We had chances to postpone this decision, to play the previous kind of game. But for the first time in this difficult and complicated situation, we took a step ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Yeltsin was controlling Chechnya policy, even though he has been out of the Kremlin for most of the last five months with heart problems.</p>
<p>Berezovsky, whose main task is dealing with financial affairs involving Chechnya, has courted controversy as a businessman and as a politician.</p>
<p>He survived an assassination attempt in 1994 and his appointment has been bitterly criticised by the opposition communists, who say he is not qualified for his post.</p>
<p>He controls a vast financial empire, has a major stake in a bank and in an oil company and is a director of ORT, the main Russian television channel.</p>
<p>Berezovsky portrayed himself as one of a new breed of politicians who have made their mark as businessmen and denied he was making any financial gain from his new role.</p>
<p>He said his business expertise was vital under Russia's new Chechnya policy, making clear he wanted to attract investment to the region, and particularly the private sector, to give the Chechens a financial incentive to stay in Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;It is risky to but it is what we need to pay for stability in Chechnya and for stability in Russia in general,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is really very, very risky. But I discussed it with Russian business leaders and they supported me in the idea to invest money in Chechnya for stability.&quot;</p>
