<p>Slovenian shares firmed 0.66 percent on Friday, the fourth straight day of gains, and traders said the upward trend could continue to the end of the year, underpinned by demand from foreign investors.</p>
<p>The 10-share SBI index rose 7.83 points to 1,191.6. It has added on 1.03 percent since last Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investors are willing to come back. The development, especially in the pharmaceutical and food industries, is quite positive,&quot; said Florian Hellmich, equity analyst of Vienna based Investmentbank Austria.</p>
<p>Turnover jumped to 235.6 million tolars from 176.7 million. Overall seven shares rose, 10 fell and one was unchanged, while seven were untraded.</p>
<p>Drug maker Lek's A issue, which has dominated trade since its debut in September, was again the most active share, firming 1.25 percent to 20,200 tolars on volume of 8,149.</p>
<p>Health resort Terme Catez was the biggest gainer, advancing 2.75 percent to 11,600 tolars on volume of 1,788 shares. Traders traced its strength to a positive earnings forecast and news that the company planned a listing in London.</p>
<p>Bank SKB fell 0.54 percent to 42,060 tolars on volume of 367 shares but traders said a proposed foreign listing could boost its share price above 60,000.</p>
<p>Source close to SKB's management said they expected the company to launch on the London Stock Exchange in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>Financial consultancy Primofin led the day's decliners, falling 8.50 percent to 31,110 tolars on volume of 89 shares. -- Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439</p>
