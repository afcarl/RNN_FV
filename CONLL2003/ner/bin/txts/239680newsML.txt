Inchcape to invest $30 mln in Russia plant.

MOSCOW 1996-12-06

Britain's Inchcape Plc will invest over $30 million in building a factory to produce Coca-Cola in the city of Yekaterinburg in the Urals, an Inchcape official in Russia said on Friday.

Tatyana Shaid, an aide to the chief executive of Inchcape's Russian branch ZAO Inchcape Coca-Cola Yekaterinburg, told Reuters construction would be over by the end of 1997.

She declined to state the capacity of the factory, but said it would employ over 250 people.

"We shall produce enough to provide Yekaterinburg and the surrounding region with Coca-Cola," she said.

Yekaterinburg is one of Russia's six biggest cities.

Both Coca-Cola and Pepsico are investing heavily in Russia and other former Soviet states. --Natalya Shurmina, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520
