<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who had heart bypass surgery a month ago, plans to return to work on December 25, the head of the upper chamber of parliament told Interfax news agency on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Today he is a mobile, energetic man with lots of colour in his cheeks,&quot; said Yegor Stroyev who met Yeltsin, 65, on Friday at a country residence. &quot;He told me that he had lost 20 kg (44 lbs) which is natural after such an operation.&quot;  </p>
<p>December 25, a normal working day in Russia, is the fifth anniversary of Yeltsin's arrival in the Kremlin.</p>
<p>He took over there, and took control of the red button controlling nuclear arms, in December 1991 when Mikhail Gorbachev resigned, marking the end of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has been shown a few times on television since his quintuple bypass on November 5 but has yet to deliver any major television or radio address to the nation.</p>
<p>Surgeon Renat Akchurin who led the operation, told Itar-Tass news agency Yeltsin was working up to four hours a day at his residence.</p>
