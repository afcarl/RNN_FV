<p>Yugoslavia is expected to seek renewal of its International Monetary Fund (IMF) membership this month but is likely to meet political opposition from hostile western countries, experts said on Friday.</p>
<p>Allegations that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's ruling socialists rigged the results of municipal elections last month have hardened Western demands for reform in Belgrade.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia, now a federation of Serbia and Montenegro, must decide by December 14 whether to apply for restoration of its IMF seat which was suspended under U.N. sanctions during the Bosnian war.</p>
<p>The government signalled it would do so, rather than shelve the issue for another six months, with two key decisions this week.</p>
<p>It told the IMF it accepted all conditions set by the fund's board of directors in 1992.</p>
<p>And it accepted its quota of 36.52 percent of the assets and liabilities of former Yugoslavia and agreed to pay its outstanding debt of $104 million.</p>
<p>The moves indicated Milosevic had bowed to IMF insistence that present Yugoslavia would not be recognised as the successor state of former Yugoslavia and must accept the same status as the four republics that seceded.</p>
<p>Analysts said however that meeting the IMF's statutory requirements would not overcome political obstacles.</p>
<p>&quot;The IMF statutes are one thing but politics are more important,&quot; said Ljubisa Sekulic of the Institute for International politics and economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Political considerations will not be cited as the reason for postponement of Yugoslavia's return to the IMF, but they will be responsible,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>IMF membership is vital to Belgrade's attempts to secure fresh funds to revive the Yugoslav economy devastated by 3-1/2 years of sanctions.</p>
<p>They were suspended a year ago, but the so called &quot;outer wall&quot; of sanctions remained in place to bar Milosevic's access to the world financial markets and fresh capital.</p>
<p>The U.S. made the removal of the outer wall conditional on Belgrade's compliance with the Bosnian peace treaty and a resolution of its dispute with the ethnic Albanian majority in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo.</p>
<p>Although the peace in Bosnia has held, Milosevic has ignored his treaty obligation to hand over indicted war criminals for trial by a U.N. court.</p>
<p>Rumours that an accommodation is under way with Albanian leaders have not yet come to fruition and Milosevic's handling of the election rigging conflict has further angered the West.</p>
<p>The U.S. publicly warned Milosevic not to use violence to quell the demonstrations.</p>
<p>The independent daily Nasa Borba said on Friday that Washington had intervened to prevent an IMF fact-finding mission from visiting Belgrde.</p>
<p>European Union foreign ministers were expected to refuse to grant Yugoslavia preferential trade status which has been offered to others in the region.</p>
<p>One analyst, who asked not to be named, said Milosevic should not expect the West to &quot;finance the regime they blamed for igniting war in former Yugoslavia and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.&quot; -- Gordana Kukic, Belgrade Newsroom ++381 11 222 4254</p>
