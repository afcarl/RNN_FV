UES denies talks with potential buyers on shares.

MOSCOW 1996-12-06

Russia's Unified Energy System (UES) has not had talks with a foreign company or other investors about selling all or some part of an 8.5 percent stake currently being auctioned, a company official said on Friday.

In response to a rumour that the U.S.'s General Electric Co had bid for all of the stake at auction, Alexander Lopatin, UES' director of asset management, said there had been no direct contact with the company.

"Nobody from GE came here. Nobody from their management talked to our management. There has been no contact," he said.

He added that no other Russian or foreign investors had made direct contact either.

GE's Moscow office said it was unaware of the rumoured purchase.

"We know nothing about a possible purchase of 8.5 percent of UES by GE," said Thomas Crozier, outgoing head of representation for GE International in Moscow.

Lopatin said an intermediary, whom he declined to name, had approached UES, the national power grid holder, before auction terms were set, on behalf of a foreign investor interested in the entire packet, which is open to bids until December 23.

"There was an unofficial Western approach through a third party before the auction," he said. The auction began on November 22.

But he said there had been little discussion because the auction terms had not been set then, and the third party had not followed up the talks.

A spokesman for the Federal Securities Corporation (FFK), which is conducting the auction, said the rules of the auction precluded the purchase of all the shares by a single investor and that the FFK could not change the rules of the auction.

At 1140 GMT UES shares had fallen to $0.0826 from $0.0845 at Thursday's close. It traded in a $0.0830-$0.0850 range on Wednesday and Thursday, supported by the news.
