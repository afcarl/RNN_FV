<p>Slovakia's state privatisation agency, the National Property Fund (NPF), on Friday rejected a newspaper report that it had sold a majority stake in the country's largest insurer Slovenska Poistovna a.s.</p>
<p>The Friday edition of the daily SME, quoting unnamed NPF sources, alleged the agency had approved the selloff of its 50.5 percent stake in Poistovna.</p>
<p>&quot;The information is absolutely incorrect and we strictly reject it,&quot; Oto Balogh, NPF spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>But he would not disclose how large a stake the fund now held in the insurer. Poistovna officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Slovenska Poistovna is among Slovakia's four largest financial institutions, all of which are awaiting privatisation.</p>
<p>In January, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar said the four institutions, including the two largest commercial banks VUB and IRB, and the largest savings bank Slovenska Sporitelna, should be privatised by the end of February.</p>
<p>But the plan was delayed several times before parliament postponed privatisation until March 1997.</p>
<p>Last June, Poistovna was centre of a crisis inside Meciar's ruling coalition of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the ultra-right Slovak National Party and the ultra-left Workers' Party (ZRS).</p>
<p>A boardroom battle at the insurer resulted in two separate managements, with allegiance to the HZDS and SNS respectively, evicting each other and occupying company headquarters.</p>
<p>In the battle of factions, coalition parties' politicians accused each other of breaking agreements.</p>
<p>Meciar then said that the revolt inside the coalition was caused mainly by SNS and ZRS interests in the privatisation of Poistovna.</p>
<p>The SNS and ZRS members on the company's supervisory board, who had three places on the board compared to six for the HZDS, accused Meciar's party of violating coalition agreements on the composition of the company management.</p>
<p>The case was solved after several weeks of negotiation between the HZDS and SNS, with the HZDS management team remaining in office.</p>
<p>Meciar's parliamentary majority later passed legislation temporarily including the insurer in a list of companies excluded from privatisation.</p>
