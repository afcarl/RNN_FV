Croat soldiers behind Moslem expulsion from Mostar.

Bosnian Croat soldiers said they forced a Moslem women from her home in west Mostar in the latest in a series of ethnic expulsions, a U.N. spokesman reported on Friday.

The woman recognised one of the seven armed and uniformed men who broke into her apartment as a member of the 2nd HVO (Bosnian Croat army) brigade.

"Yesterday we met the brigade and they acknowledged they did evict one person," said Alex Ivanko on behalf of U.N. police who monitor criminal activity.

Bosnian Croats, still defiantly struggling to make their half of divided Mostar communally pure, have ignored international opinion and stepped up a campaign of intimidation that has seen nearly one eviction a day in the last week.

"It is a little depressing that while the London conference was in full swing another Moslem was evicted from her home on Wednesday," Ivanko said.

The London conference, which gathered foreign ministers and concerned groups to review Bosnia after a year of peace, won renewed pledges to fully implement the Dayton accord that allows refugees to return home and demands respect for human rights.

Although the U.N. has long condemned local authorities in Mostar and other parts of Bosnia for implicitly backing the "ethnic cleansing" that Dayton was meant to end they have had trouble identifying its shadowy perpetrators.

The statement by the Bosnian Croat military, long thought to be an ill-disciplined separatist militia, may compel NATO's peace force, which supervises the behaviour of Bosnia's soldiers, to take a stand.

"We are seriously disturbed by reports of HVO involvement," said peace force spokesman Major Brett Boudreau.

"Clearly if there is involvement, proven involvement of the HVO, then of course we would be taking action, though the specifics are still under discussion," Boudreau added.

Moslems and Croats fought a bitter 11-month war in Mostar in 1993-1994 that left the biggest city in southern Bosnia divided into a Croat western half and a Moslem east.

Only some 3,000 Moslems and 800 Serbs, mainly elderly, now live amongst 55,000 Croats on the west bank of the Neretva river which runs through Mostar.

NATO has previously shied from action to counter continued ethnic intimidation, maintaining it is a policing problem, even though local police forces sponsor much of the violence.

The United Nations Children's Fund added its condemnation on Friday, citing the case of a nine-year-old Moslem girl who watched her parents being beaten with pistol butts and was herself threatened with a gun by six masked men last week.

European Union attempts to reintegrate the city with the help of $172 million in reconstruction aid have failed, diplomats say, partly because of the continued support Mostar Croats receive from Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman.
