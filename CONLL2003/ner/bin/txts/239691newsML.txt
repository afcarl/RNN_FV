Romania's centrist parties forge coalition.

BUCHAREST 1996-12-06

Romania's main centrist parties, which won the elections last month, signed a coalition accord on Friday pledging to support the new government and its reformist economic programmes.

Under the accord, MPs of the Democratic Convention (CDR), the Social Democratic Union (USD) and the Hungarian Democratic Union (UDMR) would grant a "solidary" support to the government in the legislative assembly.

"This document lays the ground for a solid parliamentary majority which will support a strong government created to solve Romania's big problems and able to carry out real reforms," newly elected President Emil Constantinescu said after the signing ceremony at the Cotroceni palace.

The CDR, USD and the UDMR had won general elections last month ousting the leftist Party of Social Democracy (PDSR). They ran a campaign to speed reform, liberalise markets and boost social benefits.

Prime Minister-designate Victor Ciorbea is expected next week to seek parliament approval for his government as well as for short- and long-term economic programmes.

The new cabinet will also include representatives of the UDMR, a party representing the interests of 1.6 million ethnic Hungarians -- a first in Romania's post-Communist history.

Ciorbea said he was confident the coalition would help the new cabinet implement its "ambitious but difficult" targets.

"I'm optimistic that the new coalition will function properly," he said on Friday.

The centrist parties hold 287 of parliament's 486 seats.

Constantinescu won last month's presidential election defeating Ion Iliescu, a former aide to late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who took power during the December 1989 revolt.

Iliescu's leftist PDSR, which delayed radical reforms during its four years in power, threatened after the November polls to obstruct any shock-therapy economic programmes.

But the new coalition sealed on Friday is likely to ensure a smooth passage of the bills proposed by the centrist parties.

The short-term programme of the new government is expected to tackle issues including budget discipline, liberalisation of the foreign exchange market, faster privatisation, support for foreign investment and a drastic struggle against corruption.

Increased benefits for the needy and ensuring energy resources for this winter are also part of the package.

The long-term programme focuses on developing sectors which the new government plans to support -- farming, tourism, banking services, infrastructures as well as the machine bulding, petrochemical and building materials industries.

Romania's integration in the European Community and NATO by the year 2000 are also included in this programme.

On Friday, the International Monetary Fund said it might start talks next year to restore credits for Romania which were blocked by failure to meet agreed targets with the Fund.
