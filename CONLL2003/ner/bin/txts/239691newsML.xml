<title>ROMANIA: Romania's centrist parties forge coalition.</title>
<headline>Romania's centrist parties forge coalition.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Romania's main centrist parties, which won the elections last month, signed a coalition accord on Friday pledging to support the new government and its reformist economic programmes.</p>
<p>Under the accord, MPs of the Democratic Convention (CDR), the Social Democratic Union (USD) and the Hungarian Democratic Union (UDMR) would grant a &quot;solidary&quot; support to the government in the legislative assembly.</p>
<p>&quot;This document lays the ground for a solid parliamentary majority which will support a strong government created to solve Romania's big problems and able to carry out real reforms,&quot; newly elected President Emil Constantinescu said after the signing ceremony at the Cotroceni palace.</p>
<p>The CDR, USD and the UDMR had won general elections last month ousting the leftist Party of Social Democracy (PDSR). They ran a campaign to speed reform, liberalise markets and boost social benefits.</p>
<p>Prime Minister-designate Victor Ciorbea is expected next week to seek parliament approval for his government as well as for short- and long-term economic programmes.</p>
<p>The new cabinet will also include representatives of the UDMR, a party representing the interests of 1.6 million ethnic Hungarians -- a first in Romania's post-Communist history.</p>
<p>Ciorbea said he was confident the coalition would help the new cabinet implement its &quot;ambitious but difficult&quot; targets.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm optimistic that the new coalition will function properly,&quot; he said on Friday.</p>
<p>The centrist parties hold 287 of parliament's 486 seats.</p>
<p>Constantinescu won last month's presidential election defeating Ion Iliescu, a former aide to late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who took power during the December 1989 revolt.</p>
<p>Iliescu's leftist PDSR, which delayed radical reforms during its four years in power, threatened after the November polls to obstruct any shock-therapy economic programmes.</p>
<p>But the new coalition sealed on Friday is likely to ensure a smooth passage of the bills proposed by the centrist parties.</p>
<p>The short-term programme of the new government is expected to tackle issues including budget discipline, liberalisation of the foreign exchange market, faster privatisation, support for foreign investment and a drastic struggle against corruption.</p>
<p>Increased benefits for the needy and ensuring energy resources for this winter are also part of the package.</p>
<p>The long-term programme focuses on developing sectors which the new government plans to support -- farming, tourism, banking services, infrastructures as well as the machine bulding, petrochemical and building materials industries.</p>
<p>Romania's integration in the European Community and NATO by the year 2000 are also included in this programme.</p>
<p>On Friday, the International Monetary Fund said it might start talks next year to restore credits for Romania which were blocked by failure to meet agreed targets with the Fund.</p>
