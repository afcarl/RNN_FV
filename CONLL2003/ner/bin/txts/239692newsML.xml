<p>Russia's official Itar-Tass news agency quoted Finance Minister Alexander Livshits as saying on Friday that Norilsk Nickel had to pay overdue taxes and that bankruptcy procedures applied to the metals group.</p>
<p>Livshits was quoted as telling the State Duma lower house of parliament that no exceptions would be made for Norilsk on its overdue taxes to the federal budget and that bankruptcy procedures would be applied to the nickel and cobalt producer.</p>
<p>The government has recently brandished the threat of bankruptcy over a series of major firms to encourage them to pay overdue taxes.  </p>
<p>&quot;The procedure of bankruptcy will be applied,&quot; Tass quoted him as telling Duma deputies about Norilsk.</p>
<p>It indirectly quoted him as saying that Norilsk should first pay salary arrears and that no exceptions would be made for the company on its overdue taxes, the size of which he did not name.</p>
<p>Tass gave no further information.</p>
<p>The State Tax Inspectorate said in mid-November that it had agreed a schedule of payments of back taxes for the nickel, copper, cobalt, platinum and platinum group metals producer and that it did not intend to freeze metals or property.</p>
<p>It estimated the debts of the Norilsk flagship combine alone at 500 million roubles.</p>
<p>Russian tax authorities have been cracking the whip recently over companies' unpaid and overdue taxes and have launched a drive to get companies to pay up.</p>
<p>But no companies have actually been liquidated under the drive.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree in August ordering state aid for Norilsk by delaying some debt repayments, cutting some import duties and ensuring winter supplies to the company's remote headquarters in the Far North.</p>
<p>The company has said that it is reorganising the ways in which it sells metals abroad in order to boost revenues.</p>
