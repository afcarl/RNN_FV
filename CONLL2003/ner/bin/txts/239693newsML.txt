Lithuania litas to ease as dlr peg ends - Deutsche.

VILNIUS 1996-12-06

Leading German bank Deutsche Bank on Friday forecast only a slight depreciation in the Lithuanian currency if the Balic state carries out its plan to unpeg its litas unit from the dollar.

But Deutsche sounded a note of caution over possible future exchange rate speculation although it noted that local financial markets were calm.

The new right-wing government of Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius has pledged to set up a freely-floating currency regime for the litas no earlier than 1998.

"As a working hypothesis we assume the peg to the USD will be abolished in roughly six months and there will be a managed floating as a result of which the litas will depreciate slightly against the USD," Deutsche said in a research note on Lithuania.

The litas is set at four to one dollar. It is controlled by a currency board, by which the central bank has to hold enough reserves in its vaults to back the litas at the pegged rate.

But the central bank is also reduced to a shadow of the normal central bank and has no control of monetary policy.

Vagnorius said he wanted to end the peg at the start of next year but backtracked after a mini-run on the litas.

Deutsche said Lithuanian financial markets were not currently showing too many worries over the ending of the peg.

"The exchange rate speculation and with it the danger of the reemergence of an exchange rate risk has not been reflected in the development of interest rates in recent months," it said.

It said that rates on the domestic T-bill market have continued to fall due to lower government demand for cash.

"Renewed exchange rate speculation with a corresponding impact on interest rates cannot however be ruled out as the decoupling of the litas from the US dollar approaches," it said.

The bank also said the new government should take more advantage of its low external debt to make more borrowings abroad to fund what is likely to be a growing trade deficit but that the export sector should also be strengthened.
