Serbian information minister quits.

BELGRADE 1996-12-06

Serbian Information Minister Aleksander Tijanic resigned on Friday but claimed his departure had nothing to do with street protests shaking the socialist government of President Slobodan Milosevic.

Milosevic has begun a purge of socialists accused of rigging the results of local elections against an opposition coalition last month, setting off 19 days of demonstrations.

Political sources said Tijanic was among the officials being made scapegoats, but the minister told journalists he resigned two weeks ago for other reasons.

He said he was dissatisfied with the situation in the media but refused to answer questions.

The socialists control Serbian television and the main newspapers which have given little publicity to the daily demonstrations, attracting more than 100,000 people, while vilifying opposition leaders.

The authorities shut down Belgrade's main independent radio B-92 this week because it was transmitting live reports of the demonstrations but they were forced to let it back on the air by a U.S.-led international outcry.
