<title>YUGOSLAVIA: Serbian information minister quits.</title>
<headline>Serbian information minister quits.</headline>
<dateline>BELGRADE 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Serbian Information Minister Aleksander Tijanic resigned on Friday but claimed his departure had nothing to do with street protests shaking the socialist government of President Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
<p>Milosevic has begun a purge of socialists accused of rigging the results of local elections against an opposition coalition last month, setting off 19 days of demonstrations.</p>
<p>Political sources said Tijanic was among the officials being made scapegoats, but the minister told journalists he resigned two weeks ago for other reasons.</p>
<p>He said he was dissatisfied with the situation in the media but refused to answer questions.</p>
<p>The socialists control Serbian television and the main newspapers which have given little publicity to the daily demonstrations, attracting more than 100,000 people, while vilifying opposition leaders.</p>
<p>The authorities shut down Belgrade's main independent radio B-92 this week because it was transmitting live reports of the demonstrations but they were forced to let it back on the air by a U.S.-led international outcry.</p>
