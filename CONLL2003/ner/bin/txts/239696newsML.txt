Angry Zhirnovsky complains, then supports budget.

MOSCOW 1996-12-06

An angry Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Russia's outspoken ultra-nationalist, unexpectedly supported President Boris Yeltsin's budget in parliamentary debate on Friday after complaining about his economic reform.

"The main mistake has been the course of the president and his team in the Kremlin," Zhirinovsky told the State Duma, the lower house of parliament. "But we must support the budget, otherwise nothing good will happen."

Until the moment he took the lectern to address other parliamentarians, Zhirinovsky had been leading the charge in opposition to the budget, taking an even harder line against it than the Communist Party.

"We need to support the budget, and we need to support it on the first ballot," said Zhirinovsky, who leads the Liberal Democratic Party. "But we need to convince the president that he needs to change his strategy."

The government resists calls to print more money to pay long-overdue wages and pensions, and aims to reduce inflation as gross domestic product grows.

"As difficult as it is to live today, our people are patient," Zhirinovsky said. "It's already been five months that we are not paying them. Others would have died, but ours live on."

Earlier on Friday, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his ministers urged the Duma to pass the budget. If it is not passed, it could go either back to the reconciliation commission or back to cabinet for amendment. Or Chernomyrdin could refuse to change it and ask for vote of confidence in the government.

Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov called on the deputies to reject the draft.

The Duma is expected to vote on the budget later on Friday.
