Communist leader lashes out at Yeltsin, cabinet.

MOSCOW 1996-12-06

Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov delivered a stinging attack on President Boris Yeltsin and his government on Friday and urged the cabinet to take back its 1997 budget draft and make changes.

"The state is bankrupt, the president is ill, the government is helpless and the Duma (lower chamber of parliament) is powerless," Zyuganov told deputies during a debate on the government's spending plan for next year.

"This budget must not be passed and everyone understands it," said Zyuganov who lost the presidential election to Yeltsin on July 3. "The wisest decision will be if the government ...takes it back".

Zyuganov's communists are the biggest faction in the Duma and their position might be decisive when the legislature votes on the budget later on Friday.

The Duma rejected the cabinet's first spending plan in October and was due to discuss a revised draft, prepared by a special reconciliation commission.

Earlier on Friday, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his ministers urged the Duma to pass the budget. If it is not passed, it could go either back to the reconciliation commission or back to cabinet for amendment. Or Chernomyrdin could refuse to change it and ask for vote of confidence in the government.

Yeltsin is recovering after a major heart surgery on November 5. Doctors predict he will be back at work soon.
