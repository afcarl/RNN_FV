Traders question Mosenergo omission from index.

MOSCOW 1996-12-06

Traders in Moscow were surprised by the omission of Russian equities bellwether AO Mosenergo from Morgan Stanley's new MSCI Russia Index, though they added the new index would lift the market's profile.

"Mosenergo  has been one of the barometers of the entire market," said Peter Kizenko, chief equities trader at ING Barings in Moscow.

The MSCI Russia Index, announced by Capital International Perspective SA on November 27, left out the Moscow-based utility which is one of the most liquid shares in an emerging market which suffers from low capitalisation.

MSCI methodology screens companies for significant cross-ownership, and Mosenergo is 49 percent owned by Unified Energy System (RAO UES), the national gridholder and another of the top five most liquid stocks.

But traders said the attempt to avoid cross-holdings in the limited-liquidity market gave a skewed picture of Russian equities.

"On any given day Mosenergo is going to give you a nice chunk of the market's turnover," said a senior trader at a Western firm in Moscow.

"Everything besides the top five top stocks are way behind. If you want to follow the market, (the new index) does not give a complete picture."

The index includes the following 14 shares: ordinary and preferred issues of oil firms NK LUKoil and NK Surgutneftegaz, ordinary shares of utilities UES and AO Irkutskenergo, ordinaries of natural gas monopolist AO Gazprom, ordinaries and preferreds of telecom AO Rostelekom, ordinaries and preferreds of metals firm AO Norilsk Nickel, ordinaries of vehicle makers AO KamAZ and AO GAZ, and ordinary shares of retailer AO GUM.

Traders and analysts agreed that the index would bring new money into the Russian shares market by raising the country's profile and giving investors a benchmark for stock buying.

"It is another indication of the progress the Russian market is making in becoming a full-blown and even 'normal', emerging market," Moscow's Renaissance Capital investment bank said in a weekly newsletter.
