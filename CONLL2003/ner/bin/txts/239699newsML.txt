Ukraine accuses Russian parliament of aggression.

KIEV 1996-12-06

Ukraine's second most powerful politician on Friday accused the Russian parliament of aggressive behaviour for laying claim to the Black Sea naval port of Sevastopol and warned relations would deteriorate.

"This is a crude piece of interference in the life of a neighbouring country," Volodymyr Horbulin, secretary of the policy-making Security and Defence Council, told reporters in his office.  

Horbulin was speaking a day after Moscow's Federation Council upper house overwhelmingly endorsed a demand saying Ukraine had no right to govern Sevastopol and that it should surrender the port, base to the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet.

"This position is not just unrestrained but simply aggressive," Horbulin said, and warned: "This will lead to a sharp worsening in Russian-Ukrainian relations."

Moscow and Kiev have been arguing over how to split the fleet and how and if Russia should pay to keep its share on what became Ukrainian territory when it won independence in 1991.

Parliament's decision is not binding on President Boris Yeltsin or the government, but it was certain to further complicate deadlocked talks on the fleet.
