<p>Tajik government troops and Islamist opposition guerrillas fought for a fourth successive day on Friday, and Russian forces reinforced positions in eastern Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Tajik interior ministry officials reported a clash in the village of Chinor near Nurek, 60 km (37 miles) east of the capital Dushanbe.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said fighting also continued in central Tajikistan near the disputed town of Garm and outside the village of Chorsada.</p>
<p>Russian military sources said Russia's 201st motor-rifle division had brought the new troops to reinforce posts near Nurek but did not say how many reinforcements had been moved in.</p>
<p>Russia has troops in Tajikistan, where the government and the Islamist guerrillas have been fighting for nearly five years, under an agreement to help patrol the frontier.</p>
<p>The Tajik interior ministry officials said additional ministry troops were also being moved to Nurek's hydro-power station, the biggest in Central Asia, for security reasons.</p>
<p>They said about 100 opposition fighters were located near Chinor, about 15 km (nine miles) from Nurek, where they had exchanged fire with government troops. There was no word of casualties.</p>
<p>A battalion of government troops was still under siege in Garm. Islamist fighters have given the government troops an ultimatum to lay down their arms and gain safe passage from the site, or face destruction.</p>
<p>Tass quoted Tajik government officials as saying the government would again urge the guerrilla fighters to abandon the areas they have seized, including the Garm region.</p>
<p>&quot;The government, of course, has enough forces to reinstate order and law in the region with an iron fist. But we do not want bloodshed, form which civilians will suffer in the first place,&quot; one official said after a government security meeting.</p>
<p>In a clash on Thursday, unidentified attackers fired shots and threw grenades in an assault on a Russian air force supply base near the Tajik capital's airport.</p>
<p>In a sign of the growing tension, Interfax news agancy has said the United Nations has called on all its military observers in Tajikistan to return to Dushanbe as a security measure.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people have been killed and many more have been made homeless among the 5.7 million population.</p>
<p>The announcement last week that Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov Rakhmonov and opposition leader Sayid Abdullo Nuri would hold peace talks in northern Afghanistan on December 9 was followed by a flare-up in fighting round Garm.</p>
