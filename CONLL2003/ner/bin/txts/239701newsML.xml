<title>ROMANIA: IMF to discuss credits for Romania in '97 - official.</title>
<headline>IMF to discuss credits for Romania in '97 - official.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief negotiator for Romania said on Friday talks to restore credits for Romania, which were blocked by failure to meet agreed targets, might start early next year.</p>
<p>&quot;In January, we will start a discussion on a more comprehensive programme,&quot; Poul Thomsen told reporters after a meeting with Prime Minister-designate Victor Ciorbea.</p>
<p>Thomsen arrived in Bucharest on Wednesday to meet the country's new leadership after elections last month.</p>
<p>A statement from the office of newly elected President Emil Constantinescu said on Thursday Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, was expected in Bucharest later this month.</p>
<p>Thomsen told state television a new programme was needed because Romania's economy had badly deteriorated in the past year and current criteria were no longer applicable.</p>
<p>Romania hopes for a new loan accord with the IMF to partly meet its external financing needs, which the central bank estimates at $1.5 billion for 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;What counts is not the money we get (from the IMF) but rather, that an accord will guarantee Romania's credibility abroad,&quot; said National Peasant Party (PNT-CD) leader Mircea Ciumara, nominated for Finance Minister in the new government.</p>
<p>The PNT-CD is the backbone of the centrist alliance that won November parliamentary polls and is to form a new cabinet.</p>
<p>This year, the IMF suspended a three-year $460 million standby loan accord, its third with Romania after the 1989 fall of communism. Some two-thirds of the sum were undisbursed.</p>
<p>The IMF said the outgoing administration failed to observe agreements by upsetting the foreign exchange market in its attempt to prop the leu currency. It also criticised government spending in an election year, which sent the budget deficit up.</p>
<p>The 1996 budget gap is seen at 4.0 percent of the gross domestic product, compared with 2.2 percent agreed with IMF.</p>
<p>Analysts said Romania also failed to meet other criteria, including inflation, faster privatisation and restructuring.</p>
<p>Inflation, down to 27.8 percent last year from a previous 60 percent, is put at an estimated 45 percent in 1996, compared with an IMF-agreed target of 20 percent. -- Luli Popescu, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264</p>
