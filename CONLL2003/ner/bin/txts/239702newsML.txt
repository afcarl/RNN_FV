MOSCOW 1996-12-06

German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will visit Russia for talks with President Boris Yeltsin on January 4, the Kremlin said on Friday.

Yeltsin's press secretary, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, told a Kremlin briefing the talks would cover relations between their countries and international affairs.

Kohl is Yeltsin's closest ally among Western leaders and last visited him in September, days after the 65-year-old Russian leader announced he would have heart surgery.

The operation went ahead on November 5 and doctors say Yeltsin is likely to return to work in the Kremlin later this month.

Yastrzhembsky said Kohl would be taken by helicopter from Moscow for talks in the hunting residence of Zavidovo, northwest of the Russian capital, and would fly back to Germany later the same day.
