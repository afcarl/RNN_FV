<p>The Polish Finance Ministry may consider next year converting the country's Brady bonds into other government paper, Krzysztof Kalicki, a deputy finance minister, said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We should not rule out considering a Brady bond conversion next year but no decision has been made yet,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>He said that the 1997 budget bill being debated in parliamentary committees included a provision authorising the finance minister to carry out a conversion operation. @</p>
<p>Following its debt restructuring deal in 1994 with commercial bank creditors, Poland issued $8.2 billion worth of bonds in return for about $14 billion of debt.</p>
<p>Three of the six bond issues have a collateral in 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds with a par value of $4.8 billion and Kalicki said the conversion would allow Poland to free up the collateral.</p>
<p>Kalicki said that Poland had yet to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of such an operation. @</p>
<p>&quot;A partial effect (of the conversion) would be that we would free the collateral, but there also opinions that this operation would bring forward large debt servicing payments,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The interest payments currently do not exceed $400 million annually but are expected to increase to $900 million around 2015 and fall to present levels later on.</p>
<p>Kalicki said the final decision would depend on whether the conversion would allow a cut of the total cost of foreign debt servicing and repayment.</p>
