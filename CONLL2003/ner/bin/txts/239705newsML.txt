Latvia urges laws for pan-Baltic stock trade.

RIGA 1996-12-06

A Latvian stock market official on Friday urged the drawing up of laws that would allow share trading on a pan-Baltic basis.

Latvian Securities Commission chief Viktor Gustson said that he backed rapid harmonisation of securities legislation in the three Baltic states.

"We are interested in as fast as possible co-ordination of securities legislation in all the three Baltic states," Gustson told a news conference.

Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania quit the former Soviet Union five years ago and have pursued economic reforms, including the creation of their own stock markets.

"We will be forced to harmonise this market on a pan-Baltic level," Gustson said.

The securities depositories of Latvia and Estonia have already agreed to sign an agreement that would allow investors to trade on each other's stock exchange without having formally to register in the country.

The Latvian Securities Commission start work in January 1997 and will be the main supervisory body for the local stock market, which was launched in summer last year.

Gustson hoped that Latvia would attract investor interest and create trust in its markets.

"I see the enormous possibilities a smoothly running securities market can provide to the economy. It will become the main market place for financial resources or capital in Latvia," Gustson said.
