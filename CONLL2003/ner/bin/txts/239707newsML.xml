<p>Tests on Bulgaria's oldest nuclear reactor show that the metal of its vessel is safe and the reactor can be operated, experts from Germany's Siemens AG and Russia's Korchatov Institute said on Friday.</p>
<p>Bulgaria switched off the Soviet-made reactor number one at the Kozloduy plant in May for tests after the international community expressed concern over its safety.</p>
<p>Analysis of samples of metal from the 440-megawatt reactor have been carried out by Siemens as a main contractor and the Korchatov Institute and the Institute of Metal Science at the Bulgarian Academy of Science as subcontractors.</p>
<p>&quot;The work which has been performed in accord with this project gives us enough information to say that the reactor pressure vessel today is in a safe condition and can be restarted without annealing,&quot; Siemens representative Manfred Erve told a news conference on final results of the tests.</p>
<p>Annealing is a procedure for strengthening the metal.</p>
<p>&quot;The safety of the plant today will not be governed by the behaviour of the reactor's pressure vessel material,&quot; Erve said.</p>
<p>The chairman of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant Kiril Nikolov told the same news conference that routine reconstruction work of reactor number one was underway and the reactor was expected to be put on stream on January 20.</p>
<p>Yurii Dragonov from Russia's Gidropress, which is the reactor's main constructor, said the results of the analysis showed that reactor number one could be safely operated without annealing for another four fuel cycles.</p>
<p>However, Gidropress will decide on how long the reactor could operate after receiving the final report of the analysis in the second half of January.</p>
<p>Bulgaria is dependent on its 3,760-megawatt Kozloduy plant for more than 40 percent of its electricity needs.</p>
