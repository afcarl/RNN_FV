Milosevic popularity plunges under protests.

Public support for Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has fallen sharply since students and opposition parties assailed his socialist government with demonstrations and charges of election rigging, a magazine poll said on Friday.

As students gathered for a 19th day of street protests and Milosevic showed signs of backing down, the bi-monthly Nin said the president's popularity rating had fallen from 26 to 16.5 percent.

The rating of Zoran Djindjic, the most popular leader of the Zajedno (Together) opposition coalition, rose from two to 10 percent in the poll conducted earlier this month.

Students and opposition have been campaigning against Milosevic in the streets since Zajedno accused the ruling Socialists of robbing it of victory in the second round of local elections on November 17.

In one of a series of concessions by the authorities on Thursday, banned independent radios were allowed to start broadcasting again and the supreme court was asked to review the election results.

"Milosevic gives in, to recognise second round?" the daily Dnevni Telegraf said in a headline on Friday.

The Socialists initially admitted they lost the polls in Belgrade but then changed their minds and overturned the result. Zajedno claims it also won in Nis, Serbia's second city, as well as other towns.

The supreme court was due to issue a ruling within 48 hours and the commission said the public prosecutor was asked to start an investigation.

A Socialist official, who asked not to be named, said the government was eager to "reduce tensions" after coming under heavy Western criticism over its handling of the crisis.

The official hinted the ruling party might concede defeat in industrial Nis, where reports of blatant vote-rigging helped trigger the first protests. "The courts will decide" who won in Nis, he said.

International condemnation, led by the United States, forced the government to reinstate Belgrade's main independent radio station B-92 after banning it from the air on Tuesday to halt its live reports of street marches.

Djindjic said the protests had restored hope for the first time since 1991, when Milosevic crushed street demonstrations with tanks and water cannon.

"For six years we grew accustomed to defeat, but now that we have tasted victory we are not ready to accept defeat any more," Djindjic told crowds in Belgrade's central Republic Square.

Earlier, students paraded an effigy of Milosevic in prison garb through the city and built a brick wall outside the federal parliament to symbolise the gulf between the Serbian people and the Socialists.

A student organiser named Boris said: "We are trying to prove that we are building Serbia up, not destroying it like Milosevic. Milosevic and his politicians are cut off from the people."

Efforts to pave the way to a solution coincided with the return of Milosevic's wife Mirjana from a visit to India.

An avowed Marxist who leads her own party in alliance with the Socialists, she is reputed to wield strong influence over her husband.

The Serbian leader also met President Momir Bulatovic of Montenegro, Serbia's partner in the Yugoslav federation, which has barely concealed its alarm at the Belgrade turmoil.
