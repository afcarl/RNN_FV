BUDAPEST 1996-12-06

France's Bongrain acquired a 51 percent stake in Hungarian dairy firm Zalatej Rt's 483 million forint ($3 million) share capital, Hungarian news agency MTI said on Friday.

Further details of the transaction were not disclosed and Zalatej officials were not immediately available for comment.

However, MTI's report said that the company had been owned by the state and a consortium of local milk producers, local municipalities and employees.

Zalatej, located in Zalaegerszeg, southwest Hungary, posted a loss of 209 million forints last year on net sales of 4.42 billion forints.

Bongrain is majority owner in another Hungarian dairy company, Veszpremtej, which had a pre-tax profit of 184 million forints in 1995 on net sales of 5.031 billion.

The French company recently bought a majority stake in the Czech dairy group, Povltavske Mlekarny, which had an after-tax profit of 20.1 million Czech crowns on total revenues of 579.4 million last year.

Bongrain is in fierce competition in Hungary with Dutch dairy company Nutricia NV, which is the majority owner of Hajdutej, France's Danone and Italy's Parmalat.
