Moldova sets $30 mln 3-yr private placement.

CHISINAU 1996-12-06

Moldova's parliament backed on Friday the government's plans to make a $30 million international private placement by yearend, a major step before the country's first Eurobond issue due in 1997.

"This is the first direct borrowing from international financial markets...One of its advantages is that Moldova will receive the whole sum immediately after the placement has taken place," Finance Minister Valeriu Chitan told deputies.  

"Our presence on international financial markets will be further reinforced with a $50 miilion issue of Moldovan Eurobonds due in the first half of 1997," Chitan said.

Merrill Lynch International will act as the government's agent on the private placement, receiving a 0.75-percent subscription fee.

The private placement will mature in December 1999 but is callable after two years. Denominations are $10,000 and $50,000, and annual interest will total around 11 percent.

"Initially, we and Merrill Lynch talked about a $25 million placement at some 12-percent annual but then, decided to increase the sum, taking into account a more moderate interest rate," Chitan said.

Chitan said that $15 million received from the placement will be used to partly cover Moldovan debts to Russia's government. Another $10 million will pay back a loan from Germany's Dresdner Bank. The remaining $5 million will be converted into lei to finance some budget items.

Chitan said the government expects that by yearend, two rating companies, IBCA and Moody's, will assign Moldova sovereign ratings.
