<p>Moldova's parliament backed on Friday the government's plans to make a $30 million international private placement by yearend, a major step before the country's first Eurobond issue due in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first direct borrowing from international financial markets...One of its advantages is that Moldova will receive the whole sum immediately after the placement has taken place,&quot; Finance Minister Valeriu Chitan told deputies.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our presence on international financial markets will be further reinforced with a $50 miilion issue of Moldovan Eurobonds due in the first half of 1997,&quot; Chitan said.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch International will act as the government's agent on the private placement, receiving a 0.75-percent subscription fee.</p>
<p>The private placement will mature in December 1999 but is callable after two years. Denominations are $10,000 and $50,000, and annual interest will total around 11 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Initially, we and Merrill Lynch talked about a $25 million placement at some 12-percent annual but then, decided to increase the sum, taking into account a more moderate interest rate,&quot; Chitan said.</p>
<p>Chitan said that $15 million received from the placement will be used to partly cover Moldovan debts to Russia's government. Another $10 million will pay back a loan from Germany's Dresdner Bank. The remaining $5 million will be converted into lei to finance some budget items.</p>
<p>Chitan said the government expects that by yearend, two rating companies, IBCA and Moody's, will assign Moldova sovereign ratings.</p>
