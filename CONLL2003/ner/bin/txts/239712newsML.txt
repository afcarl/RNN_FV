RIGA 1996-12-05

The Latvian central bank on Friday cut its key refinancing rate to 9.5 percent from 10 percent, the bank said.

The last rate cut was in October, when the rate was reduced to 10 percent from 11 percent.

The refinancing rate is an key reference rate in the Latvian money market and is the minimum rate at which banks can obtain two-week funds from the central bank.

The bank said in a statement that since the last rate cut, inflation had continued to fall despite the seasonal rise in goods and services prices in the autumn.

"At the same time, interbank activity has been increasing, money market interest rates have been falling, which demonstrates the stability of the Latvian financial system," the bank added.

It said it was also optimistic about the state of government finances.

The finance ministry said earlier that the budget deficit so far this year was 26 million lats compared with a year-end target of 40 million lats.
