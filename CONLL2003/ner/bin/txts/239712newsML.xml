<text>
<p>The Latvian central bank on Friday cut its key refinancing rate to 9.5 percent from 10 percent, the bank said.</p>
<p>The last rate cut was in October, when the rate was reduced to 10 percent from 11 percent.</p>
<p>The refinancing rate is an key reference rate in the Latvian money market and is the minimum rate at which banks can obtain two-week funds from the central bank.</p>
<p>The bank said in a statement that since the last rate cut, inflation had continued to fall despite the seasonal rise in goods and services prices in the autumn.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time, interbank activity has been increasing, money market interest rates have been falling, which demonstrates the stability of the Latvian financial system,&quot; the bank added.</p>
<p>It said it was also optimistic about the state of government finances.</p>
<p>The finance ministry said earlier that the budget deficit so far this year was 26 million lats compared with a year-end target of 40 million lats.</p>
