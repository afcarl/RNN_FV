Slovenia Terme Catez sees flat 1996 net profit.

LJUBLJANA 1996-12-06

Slovenian health resort operator Terme Catez said on Friday it expects 1996 full-year net profit to remain flat at around 370 million tolars ($2.6 million), depressed by unusually bad weather.

"This year's weather conditions were extremely bad, that's why our profit remained at the same level. Otherwise profits could have been about 50 percent higher," Terme Catez deputy chief executive Zvonko Krulc told Reuters.

Group turnover was estimated to inch up to 2.2 billion tolars this year from 2.05 billion in 1995.

Terme Catez said it had invested about 455 million tolars last year, mainly into the overhaul of its existing facilities. "Next year we will be able to invest up to 1.8 billion tolars," Krulc said.

Terme Catez in October said it aimed for a foreign listing in order to become more attractive for international investors. "We are preparing to list our shares on the London bourse next year, but everything depends on our shareholders," Krulc added.

Bank SKB, Slovenia's top commercial bank, last month said it also wanted to list its shares abroad. So far, not a single Slovenian company has an international listing. -- Novica Mihajlovic, Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439
