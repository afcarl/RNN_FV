Daiwa rates Graboplast as "buy".

BUDAPEST 1996-12-06

Daiwa Europe Ltd rated the shares in Hungarian home improvement product manufacturer Graboplast as "buy", saying the company has growth potentials in the central and east European markets.

Preparing an SWOT analysis, which focuses on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, Daiwa said that Graboplast has developed a diversified portfolio.

"The management has made a good job of the transition and of growth through acquisition," Daiwa's research, published in the December issue of its Equity Strategy Quarterly, said.

Graboplast has gradually expanded its original activity of artificial leather production and PVC floor cover manufacturing to include carpets, wallpapers and textiles.

The company has more potential, Daiwa said, adding that "margins can be increased through better utilisation of capacity and exploitation of synergy benefits".

Nevertheless, it said that Graboplast's multiple acquisitions "may either strain the balance sheet or dilute earnings per share".

Daiwa said it sees opportunities in exports rather than in Hungary where the domestic market for building materials is very slow.

Of Graboplast's January-September consolidated sales revenues of 11.48 billion forints 6.75 billion was generated from exports.
