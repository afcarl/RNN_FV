"There are plenty of roubles. Profit-taking seems to have started on the T-bill market and people have nothing to do but to invest in dollars," one dealer said.

An Interbank Finance House dealer said today rates had shortly edged up earlier on bank client demand.

"The market is lively, it is fluctuating normally although banks are quoting with a one point spread only," he added.

Bank rates used to have a three point spread before the central bank slowered the rouble decline by its rates.
