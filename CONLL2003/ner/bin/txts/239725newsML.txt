Serbian protesters united by anger at Milosevic.

At 82, Olga Radovanovic is a sparkling grandmother who lives in a first-floor flat with a flower-laden window box that defies the Yugoslav winter.

Each day for the past 18 days, almost 100,000 people have marched on a route that takes them past her window, demanding the government restore annulled local election results the opposition claims it won last month.

And each day Olga has appeared at the window of her tidy flat to wave and cheer her support for the massive throng that has swelled with every march.

"When the parade passed the first time, I was so excited that at last people were doing something against the regime," she told Reuters. "I'm too old to walk with them, but I had to do something, so I threw flowers on the parade."

Two days later, the flowers ran out so Olga bought a flag instead. A bandaged wrist is testimony to the frail old lady's enthusiasm for flag waving.

"I remember what it was like during the Yugoslav kingdom before the days of the communists," she said. "Then we had something like a democracy, and I want that again."

"I am sure (president Slobodan) Milosevic has stolen my vote. I gave it to the opposition but he took it away. That's why I wave my flag for the people trying to get it back."

Few people supporting the demonstrations are old enough to remember Yugoslavia's pre-communist days, but all were united by a common anger with Milosevic and his supporters.

They accuse him of inheriting a country that was the envy of Eastern Europe, tearing it up in a bloody and futile war, and destroying the economy to the point where the average income is one tenth of what it used to be.

Many are bitter at the Serbs' international image as as the brutal ethnic cleansers of the Bosnian war, and blame Milosevic for being the driving force behind the Bosnian Serbs' campaign against Croats and Muslims.

Opposition leader Vuk Draskovic's often repeated cry that Milosevic will do anything to stay in power including starting civil war strikes a chord with many of the demonstrators.

"This is not just about the local elections," said taxi driver Vladimir Bunjicevic. "Milosevic has made Yugoslavia an upside-down country -- with the criminals on the top and the good honest people on the bottom."

Each day Bunjicevic parks his battered brown VW Golf taxi and takes his wife and 12-year-old daughter on to the streets to join the protests he says have tapped a well of deep anger.

"This is a country where the only people who are rich are the mafia, Milosevic's politicians, the crooks. The rest of us are in debt, because we paid for their corruption, their war (in Bosnia) while they got rich. It is crazy, but no more," he said.

"Good people, mild people -- they say they have had enough and ask 'where is a gun?' I'm not sure if it must come to that, but we must win. We need time but, fortunately, time is on our side."

The opposition has been acutely aware of potential for the latest round of protests to dissolve in violence. Their organisers have worked hard to control the rage, and so far it has remained in check.

But students like Teodor Todosijevic warn that the stakes are high and the protesters cannot afford to loose.

"If we don't win there will be total darkness, a media blockade, jailings and repression," he said staring into a cup of turkish coffee.

Todosijevic's colleague, German literature student Boris Karaicic, was one of the dozen students who decided to act when it became clear the government had defrauded the opposition of its local election victories.

He said they decided to hold an impromptu rally and handed out pamphlets early the next morning, expecting no more than a few hundred people.

"By one o'clock we had five or six thousand, and we realised just how many people were also angry with the regime. Now we get up to 40,000," Karaicic said. "This frustration has been building since '91 (when Yugoslavia began to fragment)."

He said the surge in opposition support had shattered the fear that many people had about expressing their outrage.

"This shows that the regime is not untouchable, and now they must see that there is a price to pay for their corruption."
