NOVA MAKEDONIJA

- Balkan state should separately accomplish their association in the European Union, president Kiro Gligorov tells a news conference. He also says a dispute over the Albanian-language "University of Tetovo" should not disrupt relations between Macedonia and Albania.

- The Skopje Airport opens on Friday. The three-month long construction on the runway is finished.

- The political power in local councils has finaly been divided between parties contesting municipal elections. Both the ruling Social Democratic Alliance and the opposition coalition declare victory. The results should send a good message to the political parties for the next parliamentarian elections in 1998.
