Budapest dominated Central and East European markets this week, racing ahead of the pack with an all-time high on Thursday.

The Prague exchange picked up under light domestic buying and shares in Ljubljana were on the rise. Bratislava struggled with low liquidity, while Warsaw continued a horizontal trend.

Prices retreated in Bucharest and Zagreb and Tirana had two trades in treasury bills.

The Central European Share Index (CESI), which includes 73 Hungarian, Czech and Polish, Slovak and Slovenian stocks, closed 0.03 percent higher on the week.

BUDAPEST

The Budapest bourse set three successive new highs this week benefiting mainly from the strengthening of the dollar.

By Thursday, the pace slowed down, signalling the possible start of slight corrections.

The BUX index finished at 3,803.45 points on Thursday, up 102.46 points from last Friday's close.

Traders were generally optimistic about the bourse's short-term outlook, saying the market sentiment was very good on the back of new healthy macroeconomic figures.

PRAGUE

The Prague Stock Exchange gained ground throughout the week, though analysts said they were not convinced the bourse's fortunes had turned around. They attributed the rise to thin domestic buying.

The PSE stumbled through most of the autumn, losing close to 20 percent as key investors sold positions, tired of a market characterised as unregulated and murky.

But the PX50 index has rebounded slightly over the past two weeks, closing on Thursday at 521.1 points, up 2.09 percent on the week, and some 9.0 percent higher than a mid-November low.

WARSAW

Polish shares fell slightly this week and analysts said the stronger selling after price-fixing that followed Thursday's rebound suggested the market was still in its month-long sideways trend.

"The market could slip a little on Friday...but we can still say we're in a horizontal trend and that there's no reason for the trend to change," said Pawel Tarnowski, an analyst at Raiffeisen Capital & Investment.

The main market's WIG index closed at 13,634.6 points on Thursday, down 155.1 points or 1.1 percent from Friday's close.

BRATISLAVA

The Bratislava Stock Exchange this week reversed a two- month downward trend, but brokers said the market was still plagued by low liquidity and murky investment enviroment,

The 12-share SAX index rose in several subsequent steps over the week by 4.76 points to 168.74 on Thursday, from Monday's open at 163.98.

Brokers said that investors seemed to be waiting for the result of parliamentary discussions on a controversial securities law and that the forthcoming holiday season was also a factor causing sluggish trading activity.

Parliament is scheduled to discuss the amended securities law within the next two weeks. The ruling majority is expected to rubber-stamp the law, which, analysts said, will further damage transparency and hurt rights of minority shareholders.

ZAGREB

Croatian stocks this week seemed poised to reverse a long downward trend thanks to what traders said was renewed interest from foreign investors.

Volume picked up in revived trading, but most issues retreated again on Thursday after a firmer early-week start.

LJUBLJANA

Share prices rose 2.03 percent, with the SBI index up 23.6 points to 1,183.7. Turnover was 691.2 million tolars.

Brokerage Dadas was the biggest gainer, climbing 17.8 percent, while trading company Kovinotehna was the leading decliner, falling 1.6 percent.

BUCHAREST

Thin investor interest kept turnover levels low this week, with 29.8 million lei on Thursday, a scant 4.0 million up on the previous session, and depressed most prices.

Two unofficial value-weighted indices - the VAB, computed by Vanguard SA, and  Bucharest Investment Group 's BIG -- fell from the previous session. The VAB fell 0.2 percent to 293.9 points and the BIG slipped 0.17 percent to 293.04 points.

TIRANA

The seven-month-old exchange had two transactions this week, with a total 85 million leks in 364-day T-bills changing hands at its two trading days.
