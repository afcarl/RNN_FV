Strike, malfunctions hit three Russia nuclear plants.

MOSCOW 1996-12-06

Malfunctions have stopped reactors at two Russian nuclear power plants and another was on the brink of shut-down because of a strike, but an industry source said on Friday none of the cases was dangerous.

Anatoly Zemskov, head of public relations at Russia's nuclear power plant Rosenergoatom, told Reuters neither of the two malfunctions involved radiation leakage, and said work continued on Friday at strike-hit St Petersburg's plant.

Problems with the controls system shut down one of three reactors at Smolensk's nuclear power plant late on Thursday. Zemskov said the plant would resume normal work on Friday.

One of the reactors of Novovoronezh' nuclear power plant closed automatically on Wednesday due to a minor leakage from temperature control piping. Repair was underway and the reactor would operate soon, Zemskov said.

"Both minor accidents just showed that automatic control systems work fine, preventing bigger accidents," Zemskov said, adding: "If there had been a smallest danger we would have already stopped all of the plant's reactors."

He said that there was no equipment run-down and the accidents were coincidental.

Zemskov said St Petersburg's nuclear plant, where several employees downed tools on Thursday to demand wage arrears be paid, also worked normally on Friday.

Russia's nuclear watchdog Gosatomnadzor said on Thursday the plant would be stopped if the strike was not suspended, Itar-Tass news agency said.

"They have not formally suspended the strike yet, but all employees necessary for the process are working," Zemskov said.

Tass said the plant's workers had agreed to suspend the strike earlier on Friday after a cash promise.
