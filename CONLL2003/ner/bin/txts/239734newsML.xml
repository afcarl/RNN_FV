<p>Malfunctions have stopped reactors at two Russian nuclear power plants and another was on the brink of shut-down because of a strike, but an industry source said on Friday none of the cases was dangerous.</p>
<p>Anatoly Zemskov, head of public relations at Russia's nuclear power plant Rosenergoatom, told Reuters neither of the two malfunctions involved radiation leakage, and said work continued on Friday at strike-hit St Petersburg's plant.</p>
<p>Problems with the controls system shut down one of three reactors at Smolensk's nuclear power plant late on Thursday. Zemskov said the plant would resume normal work on Friday.</p>
<p>One of the reactors of Novovoronezh' nuclear power plant closed automatically on Wednesday due to a minor leakage from temperature control piping. Repair was underway and the reactor would operate soon, Zemskov said.</p>
<p>&quot;Both minor accidents just showed that automatic control systems work fine, preventing bigger accidents,&quot; Zemskov said, adding: &quot;If there had been a smallest danger we would have already stopped all of the plant's reactors.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that there was no equipment run-down and the accidents were coincidental.</p>
<p>Zemskov said St Petersburg's nuclear plant, where several employees downed tools on Thursday to demand wage arrears be paid, also worked normally on Friday.</p>
<p>Russia's nuclear watchdog Gosatomnadzor said on Thursday the plant would be stopped if the strike was not suspended, Itar-Tass news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have not formally suspended the strike yet, but all employees necessary for the process are working,&quot; Zemskov said.</p>
<p>Tass said the plant's workers had agreed to suspend the strike earlier on Friday after a cash promise.</p>
