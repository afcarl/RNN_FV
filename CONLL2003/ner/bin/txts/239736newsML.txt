Russia's Livshits offers modified budget figures.

MOSCOW 1996-12-06

Russian Finance Minister Alexander Livshits presented modified 1997 budget figures to parliament on Friday, but the planned deficit is unchanged at 95.4 trillion roubles or 3.5 percent of gross domestic product.

Livshits told the State Duma lower house of parliament revenues were now planned at 431 trillion roubles and spending at 526.4 trillion.

Deputies are due to give the revised budget a first reading later on Friday.

A reconciliation commission of representatives from the government and both houses of parliament agreed last month on revenues of 399.6 and spending of 495.0 trillion.

But Livshits said further work by the commission and a package of tax amendments adopted by the Duma on Wednesday, which together will raise an additional 31 trillion roubles, had made it possible to increase both sides of the budget.

Many deputies had previously criticised the revenue projections in the 1997 draft as unrealistic, while complaining that spending on social programmes and on reviving the economy was inadequate.
