Chernomyrdin - taxes should be 30-32 pct of GDP.

MOSCOW 1996-12-06

Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Friday taxation should amount to no more than 30-32 percent of gross domestic product.

A normal level of taxation was no higher than 30-32 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and Russia should have an even lower level towards 2000, he told the Duma lower house of parliament before a debate on the draft 1997 budget.

Estimates of government taxation and spending as a percent of GDP vary widely, depending in part on which semi-governmental organisations such as the state pension fund are included, though some analysts put spending higher than 50 percent of GDP.

Chernomyrdin also said real estate and means of transport should be taxed.

"Those in such businesses should pay," Chernomyrdin said. He did not give details.

Outlining goals of economic reform, Chernomyrdin called for the pace of tax reform to be quickened and for more owed taxes to be gathered in order to lower tax rates.

Russia gathered only 70 percent of targeted taxes in the first 11 months of this year, and is likely to raise only 75 percent over the year as a whole, deputy Finance Minister Sergei Shatalov said last week.

A new and simpler tax code prepared largely by the Finance Ministry is being worked on in committee in the Duma.
