Zloty barely changed vs basket, depos at lombard.

WARSAW 1996-12-06

The Polish zloty was seen trading in quiet session after it opened barely changed against the currency basket following rate adjustments after the overnight two-pfennig-dollar fall against the mark, dealers said.

They said the zloty stabilised at around 2.7 percent from the parity rate after a nearly a one-point rally earlier this week as a severe cash shortage on the market prompted a currency selling trend.

"It seems that the zloty rate may stabilise with a new range in the short run around 2.7 percent from the parity rate," said Jacek Cala from Pomorski Bank Kredytowy SA.  

At 0840 GMT the zloty was quoted at 2.70/2.65 percent from the parity rate, just down from opening's 2.72/2.68 percent. It was at 2.8480/00 to the dollar, down from opening's 2.8475/85 and at 1.8523/27 to the mark, down from 1.8510/20.

The money market remained tight with one-day deposit rates above the lombard rate of 25 percent as this week's severe cash shortage prompted by high consumer credit action during the holiday shopping season, continued.

Some dealers said rates surged above the lombard rate after banks with big borrowing needs were running out of collateral needed to take out lombard loans.  

But some dealers said that while smaller banks were badly squeezed, larger banks with bigger borrowing limits were still able to finance themselves on the market at below 25 percent.

At 0950 GMT overnight rates were quoted at 24.96/25.67 percent, up from opening's 24.60/25.20 percent and tomorrow/next rates were at 24.97/25.68 percent, up from Thursday's 24.80/25.10 percent.

The central bank refrained from an open market operation on Friday and did not drain any funds off the market throughout the whole week because of the market's tightness.
