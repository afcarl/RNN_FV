<p>The Polish zloty was seen trading in quiet session after it opened barely changed against the currency basket following rate adjustments after the overnight two-pfennig-dollar fall against the mark, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the zloty stabilised at around 2.7 percent from the parity rate after a nearly a one-point rally earlier this week as a severe cash shortage on the market prompted a currency selling trend.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that the zloty rate may stabilise with a new range in the short run around 2.7 percent from the parity rate,&quot; said Jacek Cala from Pomorski Bank Kredytowy SA.  </p>
<p>At 0840 GMT the zloty was quoted at 2.70/2.65 percent from the parity rate, just down from opening's 2.72/2.68 percent. It was at 2.8480/00 to the dollar, down from opening's 2.8475/85 and at 1.8523/27 to the mark, down from 1.8510/20.</p>
<p>The money market remained tight with one-day deposit rates above the lombard rate of 25 percent as this week's severe cash shortage prompted by high consumer credit action during the holiday shopping season, continued.</p>
<p>Some dealers said rates surged above the lombard rate after banks with big borrowing needs were running out of collateral needed to take out lombard loans.  </p>
<p>But some dealers said that while smaller banks were badly squeezed, larger banks with bigger borrowing limits were still able to finance themselves on the market at below 25 percent.</p>
<p>At 0950 GMT overnight rates were quoted at 24.96/25.67 percent, up from opening's 24.60/25.20 percent and tomorrow/next rates were at 24.97/25.68 percent, up from Thursday's 24.80/25.10 percent.</p>
<p>The central bank refrained from an open market operation on Friday and did not drain any funds off the market throughout the whole week because of the market's tightness.</p>
