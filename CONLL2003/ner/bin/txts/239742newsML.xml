<p>The Russian government's medium-term economic policy focuses on a growth revival and structural reform, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Friday.</p>
<p>The government aims for annual growth in industrial production of 6-7 percent by the year 2000, he told the State Duma lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;The main aim of our programme is economic growth and structural reform,&quot; Chernomyrdin said in a presentation of policy before Duma deputies debate the 1997 budget.</p>
<p>Industrial output in October this year was four percent lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin also said the government was targeting 5-6 percent growth in gross domestic product by 2000 and an annual inflation rate of 5-8 percent.</p>
<p>But he said necessary corrections in economic policy would not be made by printing money.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot and must not do that. It would mean death for our economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government's main economic policy success has been to squeeze inflation down from hyper-inflationary levels in the first years after the break-up of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The year-on-year rate this December will be 22 percent on current trends, down from 131 percent in December 1995. The budget assumes a rate of 11.80 percent in December 1997.</p>
<p>But output, according to official data which may overstate the decline, has roughly halved since 1991.</p>
<p>&quot;The centre of gravity is now moving towards production,&quot; Chermnomyrdin said.</p>
<p>Output will be stimulated by increased investment, which in turn will be sparked by lower interest rates as the government cuts its own borrowing requirement, Chernomyrdin said.</p>
<p>By the year 2000 the budget deficit would be less than two percent of GDP, he said. The 1997 budget proposes a deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP after a planned 3.8 percent this year.</p>
<p>This should allow interest rates on bank credits to fall to 3-5 percentage points above inflation by the year 2000, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that as early as 1997 it will be possible to cut bank interest rates to 20-25 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Current rates on bank credits are around the central bank's refinancing rate of 48 percent.</p>
<p>The government intended to take measures to reduce the outflow of capital and make it less attractive to invest in foreign currency, he said. Such investments accounted for 25 percent of total investment in Russia, he said.</p>
<p>This would raise an additional 110-130 trillion roubles of investment for the country.</p>
<p>At the same time, improving the investment climate in Russia would increase foreign investment, which could rise to $10-12 billion a year by the year 2000, Chernomyrdin said.</p>
<p>Public-sector investments would also rise, so that the total volume of capital investment by the year 2000 would be 600 trillion roubles a year, he said.</p>
