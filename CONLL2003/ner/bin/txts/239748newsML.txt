Russia needs economic policy changes - Chernomyrdin.

MOSCOW 1996-12-06

Russia needs to make corrections to its economic policy but will not print money, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Friday.

The government expects annual growth in gross domestic product of five to six percent and an annual inflation rate of five to eight percent by the year 2000, he told the State Duma lower house of parliament before a debate on the 1997 budget.

Chernomyrdin said corrections to economic policy could not be made by "turning on the monetary printing press", something urged by many deputies.

"We cannot and must not do that. It would mean death for our economy," he said.

Although the outlook for the economy was not unclouded, it was not hopeless, he added.

On present trends year-on-year inflation will be 22 percent in December, and the government's budget draft assumes an 11.80 percent year-on-year rate for December 1997. In the first 10 months of this year GDP was six percent lower than a year earlier.
