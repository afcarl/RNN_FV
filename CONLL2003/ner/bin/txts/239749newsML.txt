Russian Duma opens meeting on budget and economy.

MOSCOW 1996-12-06

The opposition-dominated State Duma lower house of parliament met on Friday to discuss Russia's draft 1997 budget and hear a report on the economy by embattled Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.

Chernomyrdin, under fire over huge backlogs in wages to state employees and facing opposition to his government's spending plans, was facing one of the biggest challenges in his four years in office.

But he appeared relaxed when he arrived at the Duma, telling reporters: "Everything is all right."

The Duma rejected the cabinet's first spending plan and was due to discuss a revised draft, prepared by a special conciliatory commission. Leaving nothing to chance, Chernomyrdin ordered all his ministers to attend the session.

The prime minister also planned to deliver a report to deputies on his government's medium-term economic strategy.

Several factions in the Duma, including the big Communist Party group, have opposed the new version of the budget.

Conflict between the government and Duma could force President Boris Yeltsin, who is recovering from heart surgery, to make a choice eventually between dismissing one of the two bodies.
