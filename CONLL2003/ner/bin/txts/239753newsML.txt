Milosevic paves way for possible climbdown.

Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, under pressure from daily street demonstrations, prepared the way for a possible climbdown that would recognise an opposition victory in the capital Belgrade.

The opposition scented triumph in their confrontation with Milosevic after the Belgrade electoral commission on Thursday asked the supreme court to review the annulment of an opposition victory in the capital.

The supreme court was due to issue a ruling within 48 hours and the commission said the public prosecutor was asked to start an investigation.

Serbia has been shaken by 18 days of street demonstrations since the Zajedno (Together) opposition coalition accused the Socialists of robbing it of victory in Belgrade and other major towns in local elections.

Milosevic's Socialists first admitted defeat in Belgrade but then had Zajedno's majority overturned by a municipal court due to unspecified "irregularities".

A Socialist official, who asked not to be named, said the government was eager to "reduce tensions" after coming under heavy Western criticism over its handling of the crisis.

The official also hinted that Socialists might concede defeat in the industrial town of Nis, where reports of blatant vote-rigging helped trigger the first protests. He said "the courts would decide" who won in Nis.

State media reported that the unpopular Socialist boss in Nis had "resigned" and more high-ranking officials were expected to be sacrificed as Milosevic tried to distance himself from the poll fraud.

A record 150,000-strong crowd staged a fresh protest in the capital and 25,000 marched in Nis on Thursday after authorities allowed independent radio stations back on the air.

International condemnation, led by the United States, forced the government to reinstate Belgrade's main independent radio station B-92 after knocking it off the air on Tuesday to halt its live broadcasts of street marches.

Zoran Djindjic, an opposition leader, said the protests had restored hope for the first time since 1991, when Milosevic crushed street demonstrations with tanks and water cannons.

"For six years we grew accustomed to defeat but now that we tasted victory we are not ready to accept defeat anymore," Djindjic told the throng in the central Republic Square.

Earlier, students paraded an effigy of Milosevic in prison garb through Belgrade and built a brick wall outside the federal parliament to symbolise the gulf between the Serbian people and the ruling Socialists.

A student organiser called Boris said: "We are trying to prove that we are building Serbia up, not destroying it like Milosevic. Milosevic and his politicians are cut off from the people."

Efforts to pave the way to a solution coincided with the return of Milosevic's wife Mirjana from a visit to India.

An avowed Marxist who leads her own party in alliance with the Socialists, she is reputed to wield strong influence over her husband.

The Serbian leader also met President Momir Bulatovic of Montenegro, Serbia's partner in the Yugoslav federation, which has issued barely coded cries of alarm at the Belgrade turmoil.

With the opposition threatening to call strikes, the government has also promised cash for students and pensioners and cheaper electricity for the nation.

The Socialists, who have presided over the country's economic collapse, are increasingly concerned that workers will be drawn into the protests in pursuit of pay demands.
