UNESCO designates 35 sites in World Heritage list.

MERIDA, Mexico 1996-12-05

The A-bomb Dome in Hiroshima was the most controversial of 35 sites added on Thursday to UNESCO's World Heritage list that included a barrier reef in Belize, the historic centre of Salzburg, and France's Canal du Midi.

Belize's barrier reef, the Kamchatka volcanoes and Lake Baikal in Russia, Niger's "W" National Park and the Okapi wildlife reserve in Zaire were five areas of natural beauty that UNESCO said deserved special protection.

In addition, it picked 30 cultural sites, including the Hiroshima peace memorial that symbolises the world's first atomic bombing, that was selected despite U.S. opposition.

It "is a stark and powerful symbol of the achievement of world peace for more than half a century following the unleashing of the most destructive force ever created by mankind," the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO, which was meeting in the Mexican city of Merida, said in a news release.

On Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Washington did not believe war-related sites were within the scope of the convention.

In addition to the atomic bomb memorial, the committee picked sites from 21 other countries, including the pre-Colombian settlement of Uxmal on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, and the historic centre of Queretero, Mexico.

Other historic centres included Salzburg, in Austria, Pienza, in Italy, and Oporto, in Portugal. In Africa, it favoured four 11th and 12th century towns founded as trading and religious centres in Mauritania known as the Ancient Ksour of Ouadane, Chinguetti, Tichitt and Oualata.

In China it picked the Lushan National Park, which it described as a spiritual centre. Elsewhere it picked monasteries and religious sites from Armenia, Hungary, Ireland, Sweden, Italy, Germany and Japan.

In addition, four previously designated World Heritage sites of natural beauty were identified as being "in danger."

Of the sites in danger, the Simen park in Ethiopia is losing its Walia ibex and other mammals; the Ichkeul park in Tunisia has been endangered by the nearby construction of dams; the Garamba park in Zaire has seen its white rhinoceros population decline; and the Rio Platano Biosphere in Honduras is "severely threatened" by an expanding agricultural frontier and human population, the committee said.
