<p>Yet another Mexican guerrilla group has proclaimed its formation in a statement to a regional newspaper but it was unclear on Thursday whether the organization would match its fighting talk with deadly deeds.</p>
<p>The Armed Front for the Liberation of the Marginalized Peoples of Guerrero (FALPMG), as the group styled itself, was the third guerrilla force to declare itself in Mexico in the past six months.</p>
<p>So far only one of the groups, the Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR), has carried out armed attacks. Mexicans are unsure whether the others exist or are propaganda ploys by the EPR or its sympathizers.</p>
<p>Late on Wednesday, some 100 masked and gun-toting EPR rebels made a rare, brief appearance in a poor suburb of the town of Atoyac de Alvarez, near the Guerrero coast, using megaphones to denounce the government and painting revolutionary slogans on walls and light posts, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They stayed for half an hour, and about 30 of them held a propaganda rally with nervous residents, townspeople said. Early on Thursday, they said, army troops with three light tanks made a sweep through the area, but did not question locals.</p>
<p>Chief government spokesman Dionisio Perez Jacome said the government had no information about the supposed existence of the FALPMG apart from the statement it had issued.</p>
<p>The FALPMG made its debut in a typewritten two-page statement sent to a newspaper on Wednesday in the poor, southwestern state of Guerrero. The document had a crudely drawn heading of two automatic rifles and a pair of hands breaking their chains.</p>
<p>&quot;It is time to fight and to allow our people to elect their governors freely. Enough of impositions and of governors who are traitors to their motherland,&quot; the text said.</p>
<p>&quot;The FALPMG and its members demand better living conditions and an end to the persecution of the comrades who have risen up like us against the tyranny of the supposed constitutional government which seeks only to silence our voices to continue extracting wealth from our country.&quot;</p>
<p>Mexico has been ruled by one party for the last 67 years, although opposition candidates have been gaining ground fast since greater democracy was permitted in the past seven years.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Guerrero state government said on Thursday that local authorities had no knowledge of the group. She also had no information on the EPR appearance.</p>
<p>The FALPMG's emergence came two weeks after another unknown rebel group calling itself the Revolutionary Army of Popular Insurgence (ERIP) published a manifesto demanding the government's resignation and announcing an offensive in the north and center of the country.</p>
<p>To date the only word about the ERIP has been an unconfirmed radio report this week that army commandos had arrested three suspected members in the northern border town of Tijuana.</p>
<p>Government officials say they cannot confirm the report, adding that they know of no ERIP activity to date.</p>
<p>Subcommander Marcos, head of the Zapatista National Liberation Army in the southern state of Chiapas, Mexico's biggest rebel force, said last month that several other guerrilla movements were active.</p>
<p>The Zapatistas have not fired a shot this year and are in peace talks with the government, but the EPR has attacked several times since August, killing at least two dozen people.</p>
