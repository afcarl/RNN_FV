<p>Cuba and the United States have agreed to work towards an accord under which Washington would repatriate Cubans arriving illegally in the United States, not just those intercepted trying to do so, a senior Cuban official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The move would represent a broadening of current bilateral migration accords between Cuba and the United States. It would be a further step towards what Havana has long demanded -- what it terms &quot;normalization&quot; of Washington's treatment of Cubans emigrating illegally to the United States.</p>
<p>The agreement to work on the issue was reached at a round of U.S.-Cuba talks in Havana on Wednesday and Thursday aimed at reviewing the migration accords, said Ricardo Alarcon, parliamentary president and head of Cuba's delegation to the meeting.</p>
<p>Alarcon, speaking at a news conference after the talks ended, said that following the meeting, &quot;there is the possibility of advancing on an agreement on returning to Cuba those who arrived there (in the United States).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let's hope this new agreement could emerge from the next round (of migration talks),&quot; he said, adding the issue represented a gap that had existed up until now in the migration accords. Alarcon said the next round of talks would be held in four months in New York.</p>
<p>The head of the U.S. delegation to the talks, John Hamilton, did not go so far as to say the two sides had agreed to work on a new accord on the issue.</p>
<p>But Hamilton, deputy assistant secretary of state for Central American and Caribbean Affairs, told a separate news conference: &quot;We are prepared to return Cubans who arrive illegally in the United States, so long as Cuba is prepared to accept them.</p>
<p>&quot;We've agreed to continue discussing this,&quot; Hamilton said, adding this was one &quot;positive&quot; outcome of the talks.</p>
<p>Under a bilateral migration accord in May 1995, Washington agreed to send back to Cuba those illegal migrants whom it intercepted trying to get to the United States, whether by boat over the Strait of Florida or by crossing to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay on the southeast tip of Cuba.</p>
<p>Under that agreement, more than 480 illegal Cuban migrants have been sent home by U.S. authorities.</p>
<p>But Cuba has been concerned that those illegal migrants who manage to reach the United States are not returned home. Alarcon said Havana calculated there were more than 100 cases of such Cubans.</p>
<p>The May 1995 accord followed an earlier Cuba-U.S. agreement on migration in September 1994. Both were aimed at halting illegal migration by Cubans to the United States, following the so-called rafter crisis of August and September 1994 in which more than 30,000 Cubans left for Florida on rafts and other flimsy vessels.</p>
<p>The talks in Havana were the first official public contact between the two countries -- which do not have diplomatic relations -- since U.S. President Bill Clinton was re-elected last month. Both Alarcon and Hamilton said that the discussions focused on the migration accords only.</p>
<p>The talks, the latest in a series of periodic reviews of the migration accords, were delayed amid a notable chill in already frosty relations that followed Cuba's shooting down in February of two small private U.S. planes near the island and Clinton's subsequent toughening of the longstanding economic embargo on Havana.</p>
