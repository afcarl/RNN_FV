<p>Mourning relatives of Argentine soldiers killed in the 1982 Falklands War will meet civilian Falklanders for the first time in a rare trip next year, a veterans group said on Friday.</p>
<p>Britain has agreed to allow 30 family members to visit the South Atlantic islands early next year to pay homage to their dead at the Port Darwin cemetery, where over 200 Argentine soldiers, mainly adolescent conscripts, lie buried on a desolate headland.</p>
<p>It will only be the second time that Argentine mourners have been allowed onto the islands -- which are still claimed by Argentina and called the Malvinas.</p>
<p>A group of 357 relatives of Argentine war dead visited the Port Darwin cemetery in 1991. They were not allowed to spend the night on the islands and did not meet any Falklanders.</p>
<p>&quot;When we were there in 1991, we did not have any contact with Darwin's civilian population, as we just passed through the airport. But this time, there will be contact because they are going to stay the night in the town,&quot; said Hector Cisneros, president of the Relatives of War Dead Commission.</p>
<p>A Chilean airliner will take two groups of 15 family members from the Patagonian town of Rio Gallegos directly to Port Darwin, where they will stay in a local guest house.</p>
<p>The Falklands administration, still bitter over the storming of the islands and the 10-week Argentine occupation, normally refuses to allow Argentines to set foot in their territory, but Argentine veterans say it may be time to put aside the past.</p>
<p>&quot;We really don't understand why there shouldn't be contact,&quot; said Cesar Gonzalez, president of the National Commission of Ex-Malvinas Combatants. &quot;All this bad feeling should not exist.&quot;</p>
<p>The two groups will make the trips on Jan. 22 and on Feb. 20, according to the Argentine government.</p>
