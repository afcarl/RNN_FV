SAO PAULO 1996-12-06

Brazil's Companhia Siderurgica do Ceara (CSC) said on Friday that it would begin construction next year on a steel plant in the northern state of Ceara.

CSC will build the minimill at the Pecem port complex 28 miles (45 km) from the state capital of Fortaleza, according to a statement.

CSC is a joint venture led by Brazil's Vicunha Group. Its other partners are Brazil's state-owned mining company Cia Vale do Rio Doce, steelmaker Cia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN), the state oil monopoly Petrobras and Japan's NKK Corp.

CSC President Benjamin Steinbruck was quoted in the statement as saying the partners would directly provide 30 percent of project funding and "international institutions" would provide the rest.

The mill will operate on fuel or natural gas, and produce a million tonnes of steel sheets a year.
