Latin women demand power, leaders discuss growth.

First ladies from the Americas demanded a bigger slice of power on Friday as 14 heads of state and U.S. Vice President Al Gore began gathering for a weekend summit on economic growth and the environment.

In a document issued on Friday at the end of a four-day meeting in La Paz also attended by U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, they said: "We urge governments to implement public policies aimed at promoting equal access of women to decision-making processes."

Clinton had told her Latin peers they should foster education, especially of girls, if the region's fledgling democracies and market economies were to develop.

"Educating girls is the best single investment we can make if we care about building strong democracies with vibrant free market economies," she said during the meeting.

As the women's meeting wound up, heads of state from 14 Latin American and Caribbean nations started arriving in the eastern city of Santa Cruz for their summit on "sustainable development," a principle approved by world leaders at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.

Sustainable development is generally defined as pursuing economic growth without harming the environment.

Latin American officials said the presence of Gore, who has a longstanding interest on environmental issues, should help promote the conservation among regional leaders.

A U.S. official said Gore, who arrives early on Saturday for the one-day summit, would stress the importance of democracy in a hemisphere long plagued by military coups, and of environmental protection in an area eager to develop its natural resources.

But the summit may not be all plain sailing as some officials admit in private to lingering differences between Washington and its Latin allies on growth and the environment.

While Washington is putting the accent on the environment and the use of "ecotechnology" to halt industrial and big-city pollution, Latin nations say poverty and other economic and social considerations should take precedence in an area where 40 percent of the population lives under the poverty line.

"Poverty is the most clear and tangible theme of the summit," Bolivia's Deputy Foreign Minister Jaime Aparicio said. Bolivia is one of the poorest nations in the hemisphere.
