<p>First ladies from the Americas demanded a bigger slice of power on Friday as 14 heads of state and U.S. Vice President Al Gore began gathering for a weekend summit on economic growth and the environment.</p>
<p>In a document issued on Friday at the end of a four-day meeting in La Paz also attended by U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, they said: &quot;We urge governments to implement public policies aimed at promoting equal access of women to decision-making processes.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton had told her Latin peers they should foster education, especially of girls, if the region's fledgling democracies and market economies were to develop.</p>
<p>&quot;Educating girls is the best single investment we can make if we care about building strong democracies with vibrant free market economies,&quot; she said during the meeting.</p>
<p>As the women's meeting wound up, heads of state from 14 Latin American and Caribbean nations started arriving in the eastern city of Santa Cruz for their summit on &quot;sustainable development,&quot; a principle approved by world leaders at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.</p>
<p>Sustainable development is generally defined as pursuing economic growth without harming the environment.</p>
<p>Latin American officials said the presence of Gore, who has a longstanding interest on environmental issues, should help promote the conservation among regional leaders.</p>
<p>A U.S. official said Gore, who arrives early on Saturday for the one-day summit, would stress the importance of democracy in a hemisphere long plagued by military coups, and of environmental protection in an area eager to develop its natural resources.</p>
<p>But the summit may not be all plain sailing as some officials admit in private to lingering differences between Washington and its Latin allies on growth and the environment.</p>
<p>While Washington is putting the accent on the environment and the use of &quot;ecotechnology&quot; to halt industrial and big-city pollution, Latin nations say poverty and other economic and social considerations should take precedence in an area where 40 percent of the population lives under the poverty line.</p>
<p>&quot;Poverty is the most clear and tangible theme of the summit,&quot; Bolivia's Deputy Foreign Minister Jaime Aparicio said. Bolivia is one of the poorest nations in the hemisphere.</p>
