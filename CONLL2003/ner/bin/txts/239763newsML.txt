Honduras' economy will have grown about 3.5 percent during 1996, a central bank official said on Friday.

Economic growth probably slowed slightly from the 3.6 percent in 1995 and was below the government's four percent target, Cristobal Sierra, a member of the central bank's directorate, told reporters following a central bank meeting.

The government of Carlos Roberto Reina was unable to meet most of its economic targets for the year, except for the goal of a budget deficit within three percent of GDP, Sierra said.  

"It is a shame for the country and business here. But it is not so much that something went very wrong as it was that the targets were perhaps too ambitious," he said.

Sierra said inflation in Honduras should finish the year at 25 percent compared with a government target of 12 percent. He added the devaluation of the Lempira, would be 20 percent this year, above a target of 16 percent.

The economy of Honduras, the second poorest country in the hemishpere next to Haiti, did not live up to expectations this year mostly because of lower-than-expected international coffee prices, Sierra said.  

"We grew enough not to get poorer, which is not really satisfactory in itself, but the situation next year should improve," he said.

The government estimates economic growth of between 4.0 and 4.5 percent next year. But private economists are less sanguine about the country's prospects.

"1997 will be a year of political campaigning, which will create economic uncertainty. The economy next year will also be hurt by recent floods, which will hurt crops," Alcides Hernndez, head of the Honduras College of Economists. He did not have an independent growth forecast for next year.

Central bank chief Hugo Pino told reporters that Honduras will not be able to acheive high growth rates until it restructures and pays off some $4.35 billion in foreign debt. In 1996, the country will have spent $633 million in debt servicing -- roughtly 35 percent of the budget.

The government this year failed to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a letter of intent to restructure its outstanding debt.

Failure to agree with the IMF means the country will have to delay by a year its negotiations with the Paris Club for restructuring of some $1.2 billion in other debt.
