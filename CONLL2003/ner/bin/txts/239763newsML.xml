<p>Honduras' economy will have grown about 3.5 percent during 1996, a central bank official said on Friday.</p>
<p>Economic growth probably slowed slightly from the 3.6 percent in 1995 and was below the government's four percent target, Cristobal Sierra, a member of the central bank's directorate, told reporters following a central bank meeting.</p>
<p>The government of Carlos Roberto Reina was unable to meet most of its economic targets for the year, except for the goal of a budget deficit within three percent of GDP, Sierra said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is a shame for the country and business here. But it is not so much that something went very wrong as it was that the targets were perhaps too ambitious,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sierra said inflation in Honduras should finish the year at 25 percent compared with a government target of 12 percent. He added the devaluation of the Lempira, would be 20 percent this year, above a target of 16 percent.</p>
<p>The economy of Honduras, the second poorest country in the hemishpere next to Haiti, did not live up to expectations this year mostly because of lower-than-expected international coffee prices, Sierra said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We grew enough not to get poorer, which is not really satisfactory in itself, but the situation next year should improve,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government estimates economic growth of between 4.0 and 4.5 percent next year. But private economists are less sanguine about the country's prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;1997 will be a year of political campaigning, which will create economic uncertainty. The economy next year will also be hurt by recent floods, which will hurt crops,&quot; Alcides Hernndez, head of the Honduras College of Economists. He did not have an independent growth forecast for next year.</p>
<p>Central bank chief Hugo Pino told reporters that Honduras will not be able to acheive high growth rates until it restructures and pays off some $4.35 billion in foreign debt. In 1996, the country will have spent $633 million in debt servicing -- roughtly 35 percent of the budget.</p>
<p>The government this year failed to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a letter of intent to restructure its outstanding debt.</p>
<p>Failure to agree with the IMF means the country will have to delay by a year its negotiations with the Paris Club for restructuring of some $1.2 billion in other debt.</p>
