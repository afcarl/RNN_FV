Bolivia to hand over oil firm control in 60 days.

SANTA CRUZ, Bolivia 1996-12-06

Bolivia said Friday it will hand over control of the three units of its state-oil firm sold late Thursday in two months.

"The government issued the transfer decrees today," Communication Minister Mauricio Balcazar told reporters in La Paz, 300 miles (500 km) northwest of Santa Cruz.  "All the transfer paperwork will be ready in about 60 days and that will be the moment when the transfer will become effective."

President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's government privatized three operational units of Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) for a total $835 million in an internatinal tender.

Althouth that sum was more than twice what authorities were hoping for, the powerful Bolivian Workers Federation (COB) Friday declared a day of mourning, saying the sale to U.S., Spanish and Argentine firms will generate poverty and damage the country's soverignty.

U.S. oil giant Amoco Corp paid $307 million for Chaco Sam -- a YPFB exploration and production unit.

A consortium including Argentina's YPF SA and Perez Companc and Bolivia's  Pluspetrol Bolivia bought Andina Sam, another YPFB exploration and production unit for $265 million.

Another partnership consisting of U.S.-based Enron Corp and Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch/Shell Group spent $264 million for transportation unit Empresa Transportadora de Hidrocarburos SAM.

Under Bolivia's "capitalization" system, winners get 50 percent of the stock and management control of each company. Rather than paying in cash for the shares, they will have to invest the sum they bid to help capitalize the new firms.

The state will keep for itself only the smallest branch, a services and refining unit which will still be called YPFB.

COB Executive Secretary Edgar Ramirez said YPFB was a highly lucrative firm and that now those revenues will benefit foreign corporations instead of impoverished Bolivian workers.

"For this reason, and in defense of the national sovereignty, we reject and will continue to reject handing over YPFB to foreigners," Ramirez said in announcing the day of mourning.
