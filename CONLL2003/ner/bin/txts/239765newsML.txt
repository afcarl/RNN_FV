Chile sees no further loosening of reserve rule.

SANTIAGO 1996-12-06

Investors in Chile should not expect any further relaxation of the reserve requirement on investments, despite the elimination of the rule on small capital inflows, Central Bank President Carlos Massad said.

Massad said Thursday's move to eliminate the reserve requirement, known as the encaje, applied only to inflows small enough not to affect the economy's overall health.

"The way the development of our economy looks now, we're going to have the encaje around for some time," he told reporters.  

The Central Bank requires people who make foreign currency loans or speculative capital investments to deposit 30 percent of the value of the loan, or investment in an interest-free account in the Central Bank.

Foreign investors have long chafed at the rule, but Central Bank officials credit it with keeping Chilean financial markets on an even keel at times when markets elsewhere in Latin American have seen turmoil.

The bank on Thursday said it was lifting the requirement for single operations involving less than $200,000, or $500,000 invested by a given person within one year.  

Massad quashed speculation the Central Bank might be considering liberalizing, or lifting the encaje on all operations and minimized the importance of the Thursday move.

"What we've done is eliminate the encaje obligation for operations that amount to no more than two percent of the total, but which account for more than 60 percent of the number of operations," he said.

The move would simplify rules for small investors, without undermining the encaje's basic intent, he said.

"We're not trying to get in people's way, but rather regulate the economy's progress," he said.  

The change in the encaje rule was announced just as Canadian and Chilean officials signed a free trade agreement in Santiago.

Since Canada had long protested against the encaje in talks for the trade deal, some analysts saw the timing of the announcement as a nod to Canada's wishes, although Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat denied any connection.

Officials of both countries said the free trade pact will help pave the way for Chile to join Canada, the United States and Mexico in NAFTA.
