Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM) and Kansas City Southern Industries celebrated their winning bid for Mexico's Northeast Railway on Friday, while keeping mum on how they would pay the $1.4 billion owed the government.

The union between the two companies -- Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana (TFM) -- won the 50-year government concession for operating the line on Thursday with the highest bid of 11.07 billion pesos.  

"(It is) the premier railroad property in the world to be privatized because it links the largest free market in the world," KCSI President and Chief Executive Officer Landon Rowland told reporters. Rowland said the route "is priceless" in response to queries of the surprisingly high bid. He said TFM "is committed to building and sustaining the best transportation system in the world."

TFM officials refused to elaborate on financing plans, saying the company is studying options and has not yet chosen a scheme. Financing will be provided by Merrill Lynch and Chase Manhattan Bank.

The Northeast Railway connects key port cities Tampico and Veracruz with Mexico City, Monterrey and the U.S. border. TFM said it then plans to join with affiliates to provide seamless service to Chicago and Canada.

With only 19 percent of the nation's rail track, the Northeast Railway moves 40 percent of Mexico's cargo, TMM Chairman Jose Serrano said.

"(The Northeast Railway) offers a large potential for development, because of the strength of our partners and the enormous potential we have found in two years of studying the market and its needs," he told reporters.  

While analysts agreed the route had the potential to provide safer, cheap cargo transportation between Mexico and the United States, they expressed concern over how TFM would afford the millions it owes the government.

"Until the amount of the technical estimate is disclosed, it is difficult to say if the company is paying a lot or if they are geniuses," said an analyst who asked not to be named.

Unofficial estimates have placed the Northeast Railway's assets at $1 billion, implying TFM bid $400 million above the necessary minimum.

While company officials said the partnership could raise the needed funds for the concession, Standard & Poor's cast a shadow over their assurances Friday as they placed the companies' corporate credit rating on check citing the size of the railroad bid.
