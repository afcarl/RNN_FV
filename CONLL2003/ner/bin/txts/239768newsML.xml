<title>ARGENTINA: Argentina's Boca Juniors soccer team seeks cash.</title>
<headline>Argentina's Boca Juniors soccer team seeks cash.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina</dateline>
<text>
<p>Boca Juniors, Argentina's most famous soccer team, got clearance Friday from the Buenos Aires stock exchange for a $20 million fund to finance the purchase of players and boost their sporting fortunes.</p>
<p>Boca, whose players include Diego Maradona, although he has not played since August, came up with the idea of the &quot;Boca Juniors Closed Common Fund&quot; to let loyal fans cash in on transfer fees if the player acquired is later sold.</p>
<p>Shares in the historic club based in the working-class neighbourhood of Boca, on the shores of Buenos Aires' old port, will cost $100 each.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, if a player was bought for $1,000 and then sold for $1,500, from that total $1,250 will go to the fund and the rest for Boca Juniors. But if he is sold for $750, the fund must absorb the loss,&quot; the National Securities Commission said in a statement.</p>
<p>The fund is underwritten by Boca Chairman Mauricio Macri, a businessman whose family owns a major industrial group and who took over the club a year ago.</p>
<p>Macri boasts that his first year has been a financial success, with a $6 million facelift for the half-century-old Bombonera stadium financed by $5 million raised from an auction of VIP boxes and by lucrative sponsorship deals with Nike sports shoes and a local beer company.</p>
<p>But he admits the team itself has been a failure, despite spending $20 million on a &quot;dream team&quot; that includes not only Maradona, the 1986 World Cup captain, but also Claudio Caniggia and coach Carlos Bilardo, who took Argentina to the World Cup win in 1986 and the semi-finals in 1990.</p>
