Peruvian security forces have captured 1,334 communist guerrillas so far in 1996 during a year of increased rebel activity, police said on Friday.

Anti-guerrilla operations broke up 43 rebel cells between January and December, police chief Ketin Vidal said.

The police could not give comparative figures for 1995.

More than 8,000 rebels from the Maoist Shining Path and the Cuban-style Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) groups have been jailed since Peru's guerrilla conflicts began in 1980, according to the government.

Although greatly weakened since the 1992 capture of its leader Abimael Guzman, Shining Path has been increasingly active this year with a series of car-bombs, assassinations and clashes with security forces.

Vidal said the security forces' war on drugs, a rich source of funds for the guerrillas, had also led to at least 10,400 arrests so far this year. A total of 25 tonnes of illegal drugs were confiscated.
