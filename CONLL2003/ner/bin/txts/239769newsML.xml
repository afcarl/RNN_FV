<p>Peruvian security forces have captured 1,334 communist guerrillas so far in 1996 during a year of increased rebel activity, police said on Friday.</p>
<p>Anti-guerrilla operations broke up 43 rebel cells between January and December, police chief Ketin Vidal said.</p>
<p>The police could not give comparative figures for 1995.</p>
<p>More than 8,000 rebels from the Maoist Shining Path and the Cuban-style Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) groups have been jailed since Peru's guerrilla conflicts began in 1980, according to the government.</p>
<p>Although greatly weakened since the 1992 capture of its leader Abimael Guzman, Shining Path has been increasingly active this year with a series of car-bombs, assassinations and clashes with security forces.</p>
<p>Vidal said the security forces' war on drugs, a rich source of funds for the guerrillas, had also led to at least 10,400 arrests so far this year. A total of 25 tonnes of illegal drugs were confiscated.</p>
