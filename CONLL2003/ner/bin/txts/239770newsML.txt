Mexico Cetes rate pares gains as jitters recede.

MEXICO CITY 1996-12-06

Mexico's overnight Cetes rate pared earlier hikes to close up 70 basis points at 28 percent on Friday as initial pressure from jittery international markets faded, traders said.

"The market overheated this morning, so many dealers were ready to step in to take advantage and buy paper at current levels which they felt would be short-lived anyway," said a trader.  

"We also saw some who had hung on to their money all day and went on a shopping spree at the close, gleefully snapping up paper at good rates, which also helped to bring them down a bit," he added.

Traders said rates also retreated from session highs in tandem with the peso recouping some of its lost ground. The benchmark 48-hour peso closed 2.8 centavos weaker at 7.9210/7.9250 per dollar, but had opened 5.3 centavos off.  

The session began with overnight rates swiftly climbing to 30 percent in sympathy with stock and bond markets that staggered across the world in the wake of comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

In a speech he made on Thursday night, Greenspan wondered aloud whether "irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values." Traders said the comments were widely interpreted as suggesting U.S. stocks and bond markets, which had recently seen extensive rallies, were overheated.

Another sign of jitters was that dealing dried up in the term market.

Overnight rates on bank paper closed up 75 basis points at 29.50 percent.

Banco de Mexico injected 3.385 billion pesos in the market by auctioning two credits, which it assigned at rates of between 31.00 and 30.69 percent.

Traders said liquidity outflows of 9.3 billion pesos and 1.5 billion pesos for credit maturities and weekend demand for cash were offset by estimated government spending of 6.5 billion pesos.
