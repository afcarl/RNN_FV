<title>COLOMBIA: Colombian government fights drug war in Congress.</title>

<p>A controversial law lifting a ban on extradition of drug lords and other Colombians accused of crimes was unlikely to be approved by Congress this year, government officials conceded on Friday.</p>
<p>But the officials were cautiously optimistic that other measures aimed at cracking down on the drug trade -- including a so-called asset forfeiture law -- would be approved before the current session of Congress ends this month.</p>
<p>The asset forfeiture law was approved by the Senate late on Thursday in what Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia heralded as a &quot;historic gesture&quot; toward the international community underscoring Colombia's commitment to the war on drugs.</p>
<p>The bill, which awaits final approval by the House of Representatives, would retroactively allow the government to seize the bank accounts, palatial homes and ranches of convicted drug traffickers.</p>
<p>Another bill, which would increase Colombia's notoriously light prison sentences for drug kingpins, was bogged down in a joint congressional committee. Lawmakers took most of the teeth out of the bill this week by rejecting the government's call for mandatory sentences of 20 to 30 years for anyone found guilty of masterminding or financing criminal groups.</p>
<p>But it could still increase Colombia's maximum 24-year penalty for drug trafficking by up to 12 years in some cases, and Justice Minister Carlos Medellin said on Friday that the government was determined to win its approval this year.</p>
<p>Congress was originally due to adjourn on Dec. 16. But Medellin said the government would call extraordinary sessions extending at least through Dec. 18 to ensure that stiffer prison sentences and asset forfeiture both win passage.</p>
<p>&quot;The government's priority is increasing sentences and asset foreiture,&quot; Medellin said. &quot;Time is running out.&quot; He added that while extradition was unlikely to pass this year it could be taken up by the next session of Congress in March.</p>
<p>Extradition was considered key to the government's effort to avert the U.S. economic sanctions that diplomats say could be imposed on Colombia next March as part of Washington's annual drug certification process. But legislation lifting Colombia's 1991 ban on the practice had already been so watered down in Congress that it was dismissed as pointless by Alfonso Valdivieso, Colombia's crusading anti-drug prosecutor.</p>
<p>Congress has dragged its feet on government anti-drug measures for weeks and signaled, through absenteeism, that it was unwilling or afraid of punishing drug barons in the face of widely reported death threats and intimidation.</p>
<p>Diplomats say this was understandable, at least in part, because memories of the campaign of drug-related terror that rocked Colombia in the late 1980s and early 1990s were still fresh in the minds of lawmakers.</p>
