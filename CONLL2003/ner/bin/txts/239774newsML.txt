CARACAS 1996-12-06

The Venezuelan bolivar closed flat at 472.50/473.75 per dollar in busy trade that saw only modest Central Bank intervention, traders said.

"It was a dynamic session that saw a fair amount of dollars offered, so the Central Bank needed to intervene much less than recently," said one trader.

However with interest rates on benchmark six month TEMs down over two percentage points in the week to 14.35 percent traders wondered what businesses would do with the cash flow generated by the Christmas period. Increased dollar purchases could be a possibility for the coming weeks, they said.
