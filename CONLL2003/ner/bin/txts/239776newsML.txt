Colombian stocks close lower as buyers bow out.

BOGOTA 1996-12-06

Colombian stocks ended lower as foreign fund buyers, who gave shares a short-lived boost Thursday, were nowhere to be found a day later, brokers said.

Medellin's IBOMED general price index fell 0.30 percent to end at 13,240.30 on a trading volume of more than 2 billion pesos while Bogota's IBB dropped 0.58 percent, ending at 838.22 on a volume of more than 1 billion pesos.

Brokers attributed the absence of foreign funds to the "scare factor" or spillover effect from a sharp drop in Wall Street stocks early in the session.  

The day's biggest losers included Carulla, the country's leading supermarket chain, which fell 1.79 percent in Bogota to end at 5,254 pesos per share. Cadenalco, Colombia's largest retailer, also ended lower, falling 1.23 percent to close at 800 pesos a share.

Banco de Bogota fell 1.68 percent, meanwhile, ending at 5,880 pesos per share and blue-chip Banco Ganadero, the country's leading bank in terms of assets, saw its ordinary shares slip 1.20 percent to close at 246 pesos per share.

Brewer Bavaria SA, another actively traded issue, fell 1.21 percent, ending the day at 4,050 per share.  

"The drop in Bavaria was a clear result of the lack of interest from foreign funds," one broker said in a telephone interview. "Foreign funds are the ones who have been holding it up," he said.

"All in all I think this was good for the market," he said of Friday's downturn, adding that it could trigger active buying next week since stocks like Cadenalco and Banco Ganadero "have been left somewhat undervalued."

Movers in Medellin included cement manufacturer Cementos Argos, which fell a steep 2.08 percent to end at 5,190 pesos per share. -- Javier Mozzo, Bogota newsroom, 571 610 7944
