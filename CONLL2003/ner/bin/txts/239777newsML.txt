Argentine shares end lower on Greenspan's remarks.

BUENOS AIRES 1996-12-06

Argentine shares closed lower Friday in the aftermath of remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve head Alan Greenspan, who expressed concern over the "irrational exuberance" of U.S. asset markets.

Buenos Aires Stock Exchange blue chip index MerVal closed 1.57 lower at 626.63 points, while the broader general index fell 1.47 percent.

Volume fell 28 percent ot $18.5 million.  

"(Greenspan) lit a yellow light in the markets," said Humberto Lopez of brokers Wainbuch y Cia.

"Buenos Aires felt the debacle of European stock markets," said Andres Mackiuan of brokers Velox Inversiones.

"Nevertheless, in spite of the 'Greenspan effect' the local market is still fairly optimistic for next year's first half in the face of Argentina's economic recovery".

A slight recovery of the U.S. long bond rate to 6.51 percent also affected the markets.

Losers beat gainers 39 to seven, with 20 shares flat.  

Main losers among blue chips were textile and footware company Alpargatas with a 3.5 percent decline and Telefonica de Argentina with 2.98.
