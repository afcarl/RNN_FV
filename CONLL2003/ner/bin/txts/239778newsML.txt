MEXICO CITY 1996-12-06

Many stock watchers say Mexican shares are cheaply priced and poised for a rally in coming weeks, though some doubt if the bulls will be out in time for Christmas.

Mexico's economy has shown signs of improvement from the 1995 recession in recent months, but share prices have hardly budged because most foreign investors have been spending money riding a recent rally on the Dow Jones.

Some analysts say that although the Dow is showing signs of a correction, Mexican stocks still may not rally soon.  

On Friday, Mexican stocks took a sharp slide after remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, who wondered in a speech whether "irrational exuberance may have unduly escalated asset values."

Most analysts thought the fallout from Greenspan's speech would be a one-day event, and the market would return to its long-term trajectory.

"We hear a lot of talk, but see no precedents for a December rally," said Carlos Ponce, research director at the Santander brokerage in Mexico City.  

Ponce added that on average over the last 12 years, November had been the best month for Mexican stocks in dollar terms, with December in a lowly eighth place.

"I find a lot of investors up here are wary of December as a month. Some may be stepping in, but I think they'll mostly be day-trippers," said Ramon Ruiz, trader with the LatAm equities desk at Bankers Trust in New York.

"Most fourth quarter trading does take place in December, but it's still too early to talk of a 'Santa Claus' rally," said Luke Smith, an analyst at the Interacciones brokerage. "It's a market driven by fickle investors."  

A big question in many market-makers' minds has been whether the Dow Jones is overvalued and what a turnaround in New York could mean for Mexican stocks.

A sliding Dow Jones could have negative fallout for the Mexican Bolsa in the short-term, but Mexican stocks could also benefit from investors looking south for better returns.

"The Dow has only one way to go and that's south. The Bolsa has only one way to go, and that's north," Smith said.  

"Mexican ADRs could be hit by a Dow slide out of 'guilt-by-association,' which would drag the Bolsa down in the short-term, but after that, the market has to recognize quality."

Smith added that Mexican stocks tend to be undervalued in terms of price/earnings and cash-flow/book-value ratios. Most recent gains have been technical, on "traders making a quick buck," he said.  

Ponce said factors in favor of a rally are a good outlook for company earnings, a steady peso, falling interest rates and the fact that investors are getting accustomed to a turbulent political scene in Mexico. Others agreed.

"We like Mexico, it has good growth prospects for next year. We expect most budgeted government spending in the first half, and that will help infrastructure-related stocks," Ruiz said.

All agreed the economic crisis has hurt construction and retail sectors the most, and these were thus the ones that stood to gain most from a recovery in domestic consumption.

"It's a question of timing. There could be a rally in December, it might wait until the new year," Ponce said.

Smith estimates that most Mexican managed funds and proprietary positions are already invested, and thus further investment flows to boost stocks will need to come from abroad.

One analyst who saw stocks rallying in the short-term was Daniel Romo, research chief at Bancrecer.

"We are more bullish than most, and have long estimated the IPC will close the year at 3,650-3,700 points," said Romo.
