<p>Many stock watchers say Mexican shares are cheaply priced and poised for a rally in coming weeks, though some doubt if the bulls will be out in time for Christmas.</p>
<p>Mexico's economy has shown signs of improvement from the 1995 recession in recent months, but share prices have hardly budged because most foreign investors have been spending money riding a recent rally on the Dow Jones.</p>
<p>Some analysts say that although the Dow is showing signs of a correction, Mexican stocks still may not rally soon.  </p>
<p>On Friday, Mexican stocks took a sharp slide after remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, who wondered in a speech whether &quot;irrational exuberance may have unduly escalated asset values.&quot;</p>
<p>Most analysts thought the fallout from Greenspan's speech would be a one-day event, and the market would return to its long-term trajectory.</p>
<p>&quot;We hear a lot of talk, but see no precedents for a December rally,&quot; said Carlos Ponce, research director at the Santander brokerage in Mexico City.  </p>
<p>Ponce added that on average over the last 12 years, November had been the best month for Mexican stocks in dollar terms, with December in a lowly eighth place.</p>
<p>&quot;I find a lot of investors up here are wary of December as a month. Some may be stepping in, but I think they'll mostly be day-trippers,&quot; said Ramon Ruiz, trader with the LatAm equities desk at Bankers Trust in New York.</p>
<p>&quot;Most fourth quarter trading does take place in December, but it's still too early to talk of a 'Santa Claus' rally,&quot; said Luke Smith, an analyst at the Interacciones brokerage. &quot;It's a market driven by fickle investors.&quot;  </p>
<p>A big question in many market-makers' minds has been whether the Dow Jones is overvalued and what a turnaround in New York could mean for Mexican stocks.</p>
<p>A sliding Dow Jones could have negative fallout for the Mexican Bolsa in the short-term, but Mexican stocks could also benefit from investors looking south for better returns.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dow has only one way to go and that's south. The Bolsa has only one way to go, and that's north,&quot; Smith said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Mexican ADRs could be hit by a Dow slide out of 'guilt-by-association,' which would drag the Bolsa down in the short-term, but after that, the market has to recognize quality.&quot;</p>
<p>Smith added that Mexican stocks tend to be undervalued in terms of price/earnings and cash-flow/book-value ratios. Most recent gains have been technical, on &quot;traders making a quick buck,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Ponce said factors in favor of a rally are a good outlook for company earnings, a steady peso, falling interest rates and the fact that investors are getting accustomed to a turbulent political scene in Mexico. Others agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;We like Mexico, it has good growth prospects for next year. We expect most budgeted government spending in the first half, and that will help infrastructure-related stocks,&quot; Ruiz said.</p>
<p>All agreed the economic crisis has hurt construction and retail sectors the most, and these were thus the ones that stood to gain most from a recovery in domestic consumption.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a question of timing. There could be a rally in December, it might wait until the new year,&quot; Ponce said.</p>
<p>Smith estimates that most Mexican managed funds and proprietary positions are already invested, and thus further investment flows to boost stocks will need to come from abroad.</p>
<p>One analyst who saw stocks rallying in the short-term was Daniel Romo, research chief at Bancrecer.</p>
<p>&quot;We are more bullish than most, and have long estimated the IPC will close the year at 3,650-3,700 points,&quot; said Romo.</p>
