SAO PAULO 1996-12-06

Brazil's Rio Grande do Sul state said it named a special panel to oversee the sale of a 35 percent operating stake in state-run telecom Companhia Riograndense de Telecomunicacoes SA (CRT).

The state said in a statement that the eight-member Special Bidding Committee will receive the proposals of interested bidders in sealed envelopes.

The auction is set for 1100 local time/1300 GMT on December 17 in the southern Brazilian state's capital of Porto Alegre.

Six foreign-led consortia have prequalified for the sale, which is being closely watched by local and foreign investors and market analysts as the first privatization of a state-owned Brazilian telecom.

The panel will be headed by state Planning Coordination Secretary Jose Carlos Brum Torres.
