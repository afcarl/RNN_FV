Argentine bonds fall but finish up from lows.

BUENOS AIRES 1996-12-06

Argentine bonds fell sharply Friday after comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan questioned the assumption of a prolonged period of low U.S. rates.

"There was a little bit of panic, but that was mainly trader driven. I did not see much client selling," said an analyst at a foreign bank in Buenos Aires. The market closed far above the session's lows however.

The dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 fell $0.45 to 122.25, while Argentina's FRB due 2005 slumped 1-1/4 to 85-5/8.  

Despite statements by Greenspan that "irrational exuberance" in asset markets could damage the U.S. economy, Argentine debt traders were confident this would not reverse the market's firm tone.

"I seriously do not think this is a change in the strong trend. Argentine bonds continue to be attractive investments," said a trader. The analyst saidt Greenspan's statements were "just a warning sign, but mainly directed towards the U.S. stock market."

Longer dated Argentine bonds were hit the hardest. Argentina's PAR bond due 2023 fell 2.48 percent to 62-1/2 compared with the FRB's decline of 1.38 percent.  

The strong rebound in U.S. and other markets during the session thanks to a low rise in U.S. nonfarm payrolls in November showed the low-inflationary outlook for the U.S. economy remains largely intact, argued traders.

A host of U.S. indicator releases next week including November retail sales and producer prices will be watched closely for signs of whether prices remain subdued.

Domestically, traders are looking to the sale of $500 million of two-year treasury bonds on Tuesday.

Traders said activity picked up during the session compared with the rest of the week.

In the money markets, call money rates fell to 6.40 percent from 6.48 percent.
