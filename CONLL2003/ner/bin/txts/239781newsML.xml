<headline>Argentine bonds fall but finish up from lows.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Argentine bonds fell sharply Friday after comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan questioned the assumption of a prolonged period of low U.S. rates.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a little bit of panic, but that was mainly trader driven. I did not see much client selling,&quot; said an analyst at a foreign bank in Buenos Aires. The market closed far above the session's lows however.</p>
<p>The dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 fell $0.45 to 122.25, while Argentina's FRB due 2005 slumped 1-1/4 to 85-5/8.  </p>
<p>Despite statements by Greenspan that &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in asset markets could damage the U.S. economy, Argentine debt traders were confident this would not reverse the market's firm tone.</p>
<p>&quot;I seriously do not think this is a change in the strong trend. Argentine bonds continue to be attractive investments,&quot; said a trader. The analyst saidt Greenspan's statements were &quot;just a warning sign, but mainly directed towards the U.S. stock market.&quot;</p>
<p>Longer dated Argentine bonds were hit the hardest. Argentina's PAR bond due 2023 fell 2.48 percent to 62-1/2 compared with the FRB's decline of 1.38 percent.  </p>
<p>The strong rebound in U.S. and other markets during the session thanks to a low rise in U.S. nonfarm payrolls in November showed the low-inflationary outlook for the U.S. economy remains largely intact, argued traders.</p>
<p>A host of U.S. indicator releases next week including November retail sales and producer prices will be watched closely for signs of whether prices remain subdued.</p>
<p>Domestically, traders are looking to the sale of $500 million of two-year treasury bonds on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Traders said activity picked up during the session compared with the rest of the week.</p>
<p>In the money markets, call money rates fell to 6.40 percent from 6.48 percent.</p>
