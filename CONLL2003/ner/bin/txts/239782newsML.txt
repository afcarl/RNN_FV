Chile shrs hit new year-low, technical rally seen.

SANTIAGO 1996-12-06

Chilean blue chips fell nearly one percent closing at a year-low for the third time this week with the market dragged down by Wall Street's slide as well as local factors, said traders.

The bourse could open slightly higher in a modest technical rebound next week, they said.

"We can expect a light rally on Monday and Tuesday in reaction to the cumulative falls this week," said Guillermo Tagle, director of research at Santander Investment.

The selective IPSA index ended unofficially off 0.92 percent at 89.55 points.  

The broad-market IGPA index lost 0.7 percent to 4,975.15 points.

Top-tier stocks have fallen nearly seven percent in the last two weeks with the market undermined mainly by slides in the heavyweight electricity sector, said traders.

The market recouped some of Friday's early losses in the afternoon with the IPSA index rebounding from a low-point of 88.4 points on bargain-hunting by institutional investors, they said.  

The rebound pointed to a new support level at 88 points, said Tagle.

Comments by Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan Thursday that stocks could be overvalued send the already depressed market into free-fall at the opening.

"Greenspan's remarks accelerated the negative process a little further," said one trader.

Losers included Telex, down 2.65 percent at 1,100 pesos, power utility Endesa, down 1.8 percent at 218-3/4 pesos and bottler Andina which fell 1.46 percent percent at 2,020 pesos.
