<p>Chilean blue chips fell nearly one percent closing at a year-low for the third time this week with the market dragged down by Wall Street's slide as well as local factors, said traders.</p>
<p>The bourse could open slightly higher in a modest technical rebound next week, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;We can expect a light rally on Monday and Tuesday in reaction to the cumulative falls this week,&quot; said Guillermo Tagle, director of research at Santander Investment.</p>
<p>The selective IPSA index ended unofficially off 0.92 percent at 89.55 points.  </p>
<p>The broad-market IGPA index lost 0.7 percent to 4,975.15 points.</p>
<p>Top-tier stocks have fallen nearly seven percent in the last two weeks with the market undermined mainly by slides in the heavyweight electricity sector, said traders.</p>
<p>The market recouped some of Friday's early losses in the afternoon with the IPSA index rebounding from a low-point of 88.4 points on bargain-hunting by institutional investors, they said.  </p>
<p>The rebound pointed to a new support level at 88 points, said Tagle.</p>
<p>Comments by Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan Thursday that stocks could be overvalued send the already depressed market into free-fall at the opening.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan's remarks accelerated the negative process a little further,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Losers included Telex, down 2.65 percent at 1,100 pesos, power utility Endesa, down 1.8 percent at 218-3/4 pesos and bottler Andina which fell 1.46 percent percent at 2,020 pesos.</p>
