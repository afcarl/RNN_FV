Colombian peso ends 0.20 lower at 996.75.

BOGOTA 1996-12-06

Colombia's peso ended 0.20 centavos lower at 996.75 in a market that saw steady demand for dollars from the corporate sector, interbank dealers said.

It was the fifth consecutive session in which the peso, which has gained sharply since June, ended lower.

"There was demand from clients making wire transfers to pay letters of credit abroad," one dealer said in a telephone interview.

Traders said the peso's losses were limited by export revenues from the oil and coffee sector, however.

Dealers reported 174 trades for a total of $104 million and said the peso held in a 996.60 to 997.25 range.
