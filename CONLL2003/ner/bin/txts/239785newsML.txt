Mexican peso ends weak but off lows.

MEXICO CITY 1996-12-06

The Mexican peso recovered slightly from earlier weakness at the close on Friday as jitters subsided over comments made by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, traders said.

"Local markets were visibly shaken by what happened in the United States," said a trader.

The benchmark 48-hour peso closed 2.8 centavos weaker at 7.9210/7.9250 per dollar, while its 24-hour stablemate was off 3.8 centavos to 7.9140/7.9200 per dollar.

Same-day contracts closed earlier with the peso off 3.5 centavos at 7.9030/7.9080 per dollar.

Financial markets across the world were in tumult on Friday in the wake of a speech by Greenspan on Thursday night in which he spoke of "irrational exhuberance" in asset valuation.

Traders said that the Mexican peso was hurt by yields on U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds, which gained to 6.52 percent, up from 6.32 percent in recent sessions.

"He knows his comments carry weight...markets were nervous around the world," said a trader.

"We saw some panic when the news had such an effect," another trader said.

Traders estimated the 48-hour peso could vary between 7.89 and 7.9450 next week.

"Once the panic is over we could return to recent levels," said a dealer.

The 48-hour peso closed the week 3.2 centavos off last week.
