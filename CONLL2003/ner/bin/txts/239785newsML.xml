<title>MEXICO: Mexican peso ends weak but off lows.</title>
<headline>Mexican peso ends weak but off lows.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>The Mexican peso recovered slightly from earlier weakness at the close on Friday as jitters subsided over comments made by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Local markets were visibly shaken by what happened in the United States,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso closed 2.8 centavos weaker at 7.9210/7.9250 per dollar, while its 24-hour stablemate was off 3.8 centavos to 7.9140/7.9200 per dollar.</p>
<p>Same-day contracts closed earlier with the peso off 3.5 centavos at 7.9030/7.9080 per dollar.</p>
<p>Financial markets across the world were in tumult on Friday in the wake of a speech by Greenspan on Thursday night in which he spoke of &quot;irrational exhuberance&quot; in asset valuation.</p>
<p>Traders said that the Mexican peso was hurt by yields on U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds, which gained to 6.52 percent, up from 6.32 percent in recent sessions.</p>
<p>&quot;He knows his comments carry weight...markets were nervous around the world,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw some panic when the news had such an effect,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Traders estimated the 48-hour peso could vary between 7.89 and 7.9450 next week.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the panic is over we could return to recent levels,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>The 48-hour peso closed the week 3.2 centavos off last week.</p>
