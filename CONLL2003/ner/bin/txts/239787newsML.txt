Jamaica to miss banana quota.

KINGSTON, Jamaica 1996-12-06

Jamaica will fail to meet its 105,000 tonnes export quota to the European Union, banana industry officials said on Friday.

They blamed bad weather and a poor performance by small farmers for the shortfall.

Marshall Hall, managing director of Producers Group, said his firm's three estates, run in conjunction with the British firm Ffyfes, would produce 80,000 tonnes.

Small farmers will add some 16,000 tonnes for a total production of 96,000 tons. They were expected to produce some 25,000 tons this year which would have brought Jamaica up to its full quota, he said.

Jamaica expects to earn US$51 million from banana exports to Europe this year.

The quotas were established as part of a preferential regime with the EU. The regime is being challenged by the United States and four Latin American states before the World Trade Organization and a final ruling is expected at the end of January.
