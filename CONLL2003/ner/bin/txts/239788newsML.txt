TMM-led group fail to give rail financing details.

MEXICO CITY 1996-12-06

Officials from Transportacion Maritima Mexicana and Kansas City Southern Industries Inc said on Friday they will not have any problem financing the acquisition of Mexico's Northeast Railway, but declined to give details of the financing plans.

The two companies have bid a total of 11.07 billion pesos (about $1.4 billion) to operate the railway for 50 years.  

The Mexican government said on Thursday that the union between the two companies, called Transportacion Ferroviaria Maritima (TFM), won the 50-year concession for the key rail route that connects Mexico City with the U.S. border and key ports.

"We have been studying this project for more than two years. I do not believe we will have any problem financing it," TMM Chairman of the Board Jose Serrano Segovia told reporters.

According to the government's financing plan, TFM will owe 40 percent of the railroad operating rights payment, 4.43 million pesos ($559 million), by January 31. The remaining sum will be due within the next six months, company officials said.  

TFM officials said it will be assisted in financing by Merrill Lynch and Chase Manhattan Bank.

"There are a lot of ways to finance the project that we are looking at," Merrill Lynch investment banking managing director Carlos Gutierrez told Reuters. He said funding will be divided between TFM and TMM, but refused to detail possible financing methods for the cost of the railroad concession.

While Gutierrez said investors were not nervous about TMM and Kansas City Southern's debt, Standard & Poor's Corp said on Friday that it may cut debt ratings on corporate credit and unsecured credit from the two companies.
