<title>BRAZIL: Solution for Brazil's Bamerindus seen near.</title>
<headline>Solution for Brazil's Bamerindus seen near.</headline>
<dateline>SAO PAULO 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>A solution for troubled Brazilian private bank Bamerindus is likely to be announced soon and should involve a change in the bank's ownership, banking sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a solution within the next 15 days,&quot; said a source closely following the negotiations between Bamerindus and the Central Bank, who asked for anonymity.</p>
<p>Under the plan being designed, a group of executives or one private administrator would take over Bamerindus and manage it for a certain period of time, he said.  </p>
<p>This group or administrator would hire a private consultant who would help clean up Bamerindus' balance sheets and prepare the bank for an eventual sale to investors later.</p>
<p>Bamerindus is controlled by the holding company Bamerindus Participacoes - Empreendimentos, owned by Andrade Vieira family.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Shangai Banking Corporation owns 6.14 percent of the bank's capital and has been reported by newspapers as the best candidate for being the depositary of Bamerindus' shares while the bank is in the hands of an independent administrator.  </p>
<p>For many months, Bamerindus, Brazil's fourth largest private bank, has been plagued by speculation that it would be sold due to its liquidity troubles.</p>
<p>Newspapers have reported that private banks Banco Icatu, Pactual and Graphus were the most likely candidates for signing a contract to advise on the bank's management.</p>
<p>Banco Icatu has confirmed ongoing talks with Bamerindus but declined to make further comments.  </p>
<p>Senator Jose Eduardo Andrade Vieira, Bamerindus' majority shareholder, has acknowledged he would give up control of the bank, according to Fernando Rodrigues da Silva, director of the National Confederation of Banking Workers and a member of a committee made up of Bamerindus' employees who has been following the negotiations.</p>
<p>Rodrigues da Silva said he was told by Andrade Vieira that the banker does not oppose to losing control of Bamerindus because &quot;he has been distant from the bank's management for a long time.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;It is not true that he (Andrade Vieira) has been an obstacle,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Press reports have also said that Bamerindus would obtain 6.0 billion reais in Central Bank loans to help the bank recapitalize.</p>
<p>But a Central Bank spokesman did not confirm a six billion real credit line was being negotiated for Bamerindus.</p>
<p>Rodrigues da Silva said Bamerindus's workers committee would be in Congress next week in a bid to ensure that Bamerindus' solution guarantees the participation of a representative of the bank's employees in Bamerindus' new administration.</p>
<p>He also said he wants to ensure that the rights of Bamerindus' minority holders will be protected and the bank's headquarters will continue in the southern state of Parana.</p>
