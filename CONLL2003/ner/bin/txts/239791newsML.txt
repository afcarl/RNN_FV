Caracas stocks slump on Greenspan remarks.

CARACAS 1996-12-06

Caracas stocks slumped in thin trade after remarks late Thursday by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan of "irrational exuberance" in financial markets roiled stocks markets worldwide, traders said.

The Caracas bolsa  index slipped 1.59 percent to close at 6,097.42 points as 31 shares fell, seven rose and six closed flat.

National telephone company CANTV and leading utility Electricidad de Caracas led the drop, loosing 70.00 and 11.00 bolivars respectively to close at 1810.00 and 507.00.  

"Greenspan didn't help, and as trade was thin anyway large sales of stocks in companies like Electricidad dragged down the whole market," said Cavelba broker Eduardo Blanco.

Greenspan's suggestion that stock markets may be running ahead of themselves raised fears of a possible rise in U.S. interest rates -- a fear later quelled by soft U.S. employment data.

His comments failed, however, to boost Caracas trade volume which remained at a modest 10.6 million shares, worth 2.6 billion bolivars ($5.5 million).  

Among other widely held stocks, steel company Sivensa slipped 10.00 bolivars to close at 315.00, while foods company Mavesa closed off 0.95 bolivars at 137.00.

Mavesa announced after close of trade that it had begun an exchange offer for its outstanding restricted 144-A American Depository Receipts (ADRs). The offer will allow stock holders to trade Mavesa ADRs freely.
