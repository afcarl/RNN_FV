Brazil shrs pare losses, still end off on Greenspan.

SAO PAULO 1996-12-06

Brazil shares pared some losses, but still ended broadly lower on muscular volume after U.S. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said U.S. stocks were irrationally upbeat, prompting shockwaves of worldwide selling, brokers said.

"Everyone was focused on that," said John Carioba of Indusval brokerage. "There were no other factors that really affected the market."

The Sao Paulo bourse's Bovespa index of 49 most-traded shares closed down 1.07 percent, or 742 points, at 68,729 points in bulging trade of 673.6 million reais.  

Brokers said Greenspan's comments on Tuesday night overshadowed trading on local bourses. Investors spun off Brazilian shares even before Wall Street opened for business and local stocks kept falling as the Dow dropped at the open.

The hefty trade, as usual, was focused heavily on benchmark Telebras, whose preferred ended off 1.60 percent at 79.80 reais and voting common fell a steeper 2.71 percent to close at 71.70 reais.

"It really weighed on Telebras," said one dealer.

Brokers said local selling lost steam as the Dow steadied at midday and prices began rising again late in the session.  

But the recovery was not enough to prevent most leading shares from ending solidly lower.

State power firm Eletrobras ended down 1.08 percent to close at 366.00 reais, while Minas Gerais state's Cemig power firm fell 2.18 percent to 35.90 reais.

The shares led a 0.04 percent decline in the bolsa's Electrical Energy Index of nine most-liquid power shares, which closed at 1,859 points. Meanwhile, blue chip state mining giant Cia Vale do Rio Doce ended flat at 21.00 reais and state oil monopoly Petrobras closed up 0.64 percent at 154.49 reais.  

The session also saw trade suspended in troubled Bamerindus was suspended in the morning following a newspaper report that the government would finance a change in the bank's ownership. Trade resumed shortly after midday, when the bank told the bolsa it did not confirm the report and the share closed flat at 17 reais.

Brokers said prices should rise moderately next week in volatility trade ahead of October 16 options settlements, as investors return to the local bourse in search of bargains following today's drop in the Bovespa.

"It would say its a good buy opportunity," Carioba said.
