Argentina's Boca Juniors seek cash boost in market.

BUENOS AIRES 1996-12-06

Boca Juniors, Argentina's most famous soccer team, got clearance Friday from the Buenos Aires stock exchange for a $20 million fund to finance the purchase of players and boost their sporting fortunes.

Boca, whose players include Diego Maradona though he has not played since August, came up with the idea of the "Boca Juniors Closed Common Fund" to let loyal fans cash in on transfer fees if the player acquired is later sold.

Shares in the historic club based in the working-class neighborhood of Boca, on the shores of Buenos Aires' old port, will cost $100 each.

The fund is underwritten by Boca Chairman Mauricio Macri, whose family owns a major industrial group and who took over the club a year ago.
