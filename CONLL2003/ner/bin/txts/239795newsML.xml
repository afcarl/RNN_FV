<p>Brazil's chocolate production is set to keep growing with this year's output expected to show an increase of eight percent over 1995 and a further rise predicted for next year.</p>
<p>Brazil, where Nestle, Garoto and Lacta dominate the chocolate manufacturing market, is expected to produce 308,000 tonnes in 1996, according to the Brazilian Association of Chocolate, Cocoa, Sweets and Derivatives (Abicab).</p>
<p>Abicab's Dirceo Campera said the figure, which compared to a total of 293,700 tonnes for 1995, was a pleasant surprise as an increase of only two to three percent had been expected at the start of 1996.</p>
<p>Production was expected to continue on the increase next year, Campera said. &quot;The Easter period will be decisive but at the moment, we're working on a prediction of an increase of around six percent,&quot; he said.  This would mean output of around 327,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;The Brazilian chocolate industry is in a very healthy position as it is in the hands of three very well-run companies who are constantly investing to increase production,&quot; Campora said.</p>
<p>Output has shown a startling increase since 1990, when 186,000 tonnes was produced. Apart from a drop in production in 1992, it has risen steadily, the best results coming in 1994, the year of an anti-inflationary plan which finally produced economic stability in Brazil following years of hyper-inflation.</p>
<p>Production in  1994 was 251,000 tonnes, up from 220,000 tonnes the year before.</p>
<p>The growing chocolate consumption amongst Brazilians has also resulted in the import of chocolate.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, local production of cocoa, which is grown chiefly in the state of Bahia, has dropped almost as quickly as chocolate production has risen.</p>
<p>Until around 1990, Brazil traditionally produced cocoa crops of around 6.0 million 60-kilo bags, around 360,000 tonnes. The 1996/7 crop year which finished in April, however, is expected to produce less than 3.0 million bags.</p>
<p>The current main crop, harvested from October to April, was badly hit by a two-month drought during June and July and is not expected to produce more than one million bags.</p>
<p>Producers said that rainfall has returned to normal in the last month but that the benefits will only be felt in the next midcrop, which is harvested from May to September.</p>
<p>Internal prices for beans remained at around 20 Real per 15- kilo arroba this week, producers said.</p>
