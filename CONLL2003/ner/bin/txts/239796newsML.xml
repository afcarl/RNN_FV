<p>The author of a book blaming Mexican government corruption for delaying the arrest of a key drug lord has been murdered along with her lawyer husband and three children in what detectives suspect was a revenge crime.</p>
<p>Police said on Friday they found the bodies of journalist Yolanda Figueroa, her husband, Fernando Balderas, and their three children on Thursday lying in pools of blood at their stylish home in the Pedregal district of Mexico City.</p>
<p>Elias Romero Apis, a city criminal prosecutor, said the grisly quintuple killings bore the signs of a revenge attack but would not speculate on who might have ordered them.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't look as though robbery was the motive. There were valuable objects in the house that were not taken, though the house was left in disarray,&quot; he told Radio Red radio.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like some kind of revenge or some kind of settling of accounts,&quot; he added. &quot;... This was not a long piece of work or one that took hours. This was something almost instantaneous, that happened in a few minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>The intruders entered on Tuesday night while the family was asleep and killed the couple, their 18-year-old daughter and their two sons, 14 and 9, before escaping in their car, he said. Neighbours heard nothing but the family's driver survived the attack and police said they planned to question him when he had recovered from his injuries.</p>
<p>Figueroa's book on Gulf cocaine cartel chief Juan Garcia Abrego caused a stir when it was published in August. It said the Mexican government had all the information it needed to capture Garcia Abrego nearly three years before the arrest.</p>
<p>Relying largely on the help of her husband, who was a key adviser in the attorney-general's office in the early 1990s, Figueroa also suggested that Garcia Abrego might not even have been captured by police in January 1996 but may have surrendered as part of a deal struck with the government.</p>
<p>Figueroa's book &quot;The Gulf Capo: Life and Capture of Juan Garcia Abrego&quot; was also memorable for another reason. The special guest at the book presentation in August was an anti-drug official in the attorney-general's office who quit his job to denounce corruption: Ricardo Cordero Ontiveros.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, police arrested Cordero Ontiveros, who had not been publicly accused of wrongdoing until he made his allegations against the authorities, charging him with corruption and other offences. He was sent to a jail in Tijuana and has not been heard from since.</p>
<p>In a similar development, police said on Friday that Balderas was wanted for raping his maid and for extortion. Romero said Balderas had an arrest warrant outstanding against him since September, the month after the book's publication.</p>
<p>He said police had been unable to find him, although he was apparently living at home.</p>
<p>Romero said the family was murdered with blows from blunt objects and with knives. This contradicted reports from journalists at the murder scene, who all said on Friday the family were killed with single bullets through the head.</p>
<p>One Mexican law enforcement source, speaking not for attribution, said on Friday: &quot;You can never know if these people were honest crusaders or corrupt scum. Nothing is black and white here -- everything is gray.&quot;</p>
