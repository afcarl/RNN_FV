Brazil's real closes flat in calm trading.

SAO PAULO 1996-12-06

Brazil's real closed steady at 1.0346 against the dollar in calm trading on the commercial foreign exchange market, dealers said.

"After two consecutives drops in the mini-band, nobody was expecting anything for today," one trader said.

The Central Bank lowered the real-dollar mini-band on both Wednesday and Thursday. Currently, it is between 1.0345 and 1.0395 reais per dollar.

Dealers did not expect a new drop in the mini-band before next Tuesday.

They also expect more outflows in the coming weeks as is usual in December.

"Many companies send royalties and dividends to their headquarters before the end of the year," one dealer said.

But traders hoped the market would not react too nervously to the outflows.

In the interbank forex floating rate market, the real closed at 1.0402 per dollar, up 0.01 percent.

In the illegal parallel market, the real ended flat at 1.098 to the greenback.
