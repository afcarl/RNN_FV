Parents visit U.S. woman "terrorist" in Peru jail.

LIMA 1996-12-06

The parents of Lori Berenson, an American jailed for life as a convicted terrorist, came to Peru Friday hoping to see her for the first time in a year.

"We are very anxious to see Lori and check for ourselves how she is doing," her father, Mark Berenson, told Reuters.

Lori Berenson, 27, was sentenced by a "faceless" military court in January to life imprisonment for treason and is in solitary confinement at the Yanamayo maximum security prison in the 13,000 foot- (4,000 metre) high Andean city of Puno.

Her mother, Rhoda Berenson, said she had steeled herself for seeing her daughter's condition. "We are prepared. We know she has swollen fingers because of the altitude, laryngitis and has lost weight," she said.

The parents, from New York City, will travel to Puno early Saturday but did not know if they would see their daughter close up or through a screen. By law, they had to wait a year before visiting her.

She was sentenced for allegedly helping plot a takeover of the Peruvian Congress by the Cuban-style guerrilla group, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). Two members of her immediate family -- mother, father and sister -- will now be able to have direct contact with her once a month.

Her parents have been kept informed with how she is coping with the extreme cold at night and inadequate food through occasional "cheerful but censured" letters and monthly visits by the U.S. Embassy and her Peruvian lawyer Grimaldo Achahui.

Since her conviction, there has been a coordinated campaign in the United States -- actively supported by former President Jimmy Carter -- to annul the decision of the military court, where anonymous judges usually wear hoods and do not allow cross-examination of witnesses.

Diplomatic pressure from Washington has also led Peru's President Alberto Fujimori to say he was considering a deal in which Berenson could be transferred to the United States.

While Berenson's legal team have welcomed the political moves, the lawyers still hope to prove she is innocent.
