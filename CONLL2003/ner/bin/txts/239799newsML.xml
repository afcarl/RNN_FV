<headline>Parents visit U.S. woman &quot;terrorist&quot; in Peru jail.</headline>

<p>The parents of Lori Berenson, an American jailed for life as a convicted terrorist, came to Peru Friday hoping to see her for the first time in a year.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very anxious to see Lori and check for ourselves how she is doing,&quot; her father, Mark Berenson, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Lori Berenson, 27, was sentenced by a &quot;faceless&quot; military court in January to life imprisonment for treason and is in solitary confinement at the Yanamayo maximum security prison in the 13,000 foot- (4,000 metre) high Andean city of Puno.</p>
<p>Her mother, Rhoda Berenson, said she had steeled herself for seeing her daughter's condition. &quot;We are prepared. We know she has swollen fingers because of the altitude, laryngitis and has lost weight,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The parents, from New York City, will travel to Puno early Saturday but did not know if they would see their daughter close up or through a screen. By law, they had to wait a year before visiting her.</p>
<p>She was sentenced for allegedly helping plot a takeover of the Peruvian Congress by the Cuban-style guerrilla group, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). Two members of her immediate family -- mother, father and sister -- will now be able to have direct contact with her once a month.</p>
<p>Her parents have been kept informed with how she is coping with the extreme cold at night and inadequate food through occasional &quot;cheerful but censured&quot; letters and monthly visits by the U.S. Embassy and her Peruvian lawyer Grimaldo Achahui.</p>
<p>Since her conviction, there has been a coordinated campaign in the United States -- actively supported by former President Jimmy Carter -- to annul the decision of the military court, where anonymous judges usually wear hoods and do not allow cross-examination of witnesses.</p>
<p>Diplomatic pressure from Washington has also led Peru's President Alberto Fujimori to say he was considering a deal in which Berenson could be transferred to the United States.</p>
<p>While Berenson's legal team have welcomed the political moves, the lawyers still hope to prove she is innocent.</p>
