ASUNCION 1996-12-06

Canadian-owned firm  Parana River Mill Development will spend $300 million building a paper pulp processing plant in Paraguay, the Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone said Friday.

The plant will be built in Itapua department, 400 km south of the capital Asuncion and will include a 5,000 hectare-a-year reforestation plan in the area.

But, while the plant's own forests are growing, it will import wood from the Argentine province of Misiones when it begins operation in 1997, Scavone said.

The plant will also export woodchips to Japan.
