<p>The government's share placement of its 30 percent stake in Luz del Sur has drawn bids from individual Peruvian investors worth 600 million soles ($233 million), President Alberto Fujimori said Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;150,000 Peruvians have asked for 600 million soles (worth of shares). This result is well over the number of shares available, which is 55 percent of the total offer,&quot; Fujimori told reporters.</p>
<p>The sale's managers intended to distribute 240 million soles worth of shares in the electricity distributor to individuals, acording to a source close to the sale.  </p>
<p>The government, hoping to raise -- at home and abroad -- a total of $200 million from the sale, has always maintained that it would distribute only 55 percent of the shares sold in the placement to individual investors.</p>
<p>Under a scheme known as Citizens' Participation in Privatization, where nationals receive up to a ten percent discount, individuals had two weeks to bid on shares before the program ended on November 29.  </p>
<p>In July, there was so much unsatisfied local demand in the placement of state-held shares in Telefnica del Per that the government was forced to sell a further three percent stake in the company after the original offer closed.</p>
<p>In the Luz del Sur sale, the government expects institutional investors at home and abroad to buy the remaining 45 percent of the placement. The price of those shares will be set December 10.</p>
<p>The government will define the distribution of the shares it sells on December 13.  </p>
<p>Officials from investment bank CS First Boston -- chosen by the government to handle the international portion of the sale -- said they expected the placement abroad to raise about $100 million.</p>
<p>The domestic portion of the sale was divided into two parts.</p>
<p>In the sale of shares to individual Peruvian nationals, Banco Continental directed a group of local banks that includes Banco de Crdito, Interbanc and Banco Wiese.  </p>
<p>In the second part of the local sale, Spain's Banco Santander was selected to handle the placement with local institutions. The Spanish bank's brokerage in Peru, Santander SAB, will direct a group of local brokerages to book-build with institutions such as local pension funds, insurance companies and banks.</p>
<p>In June 1994, a consortium consisting of Chile's Chilquinta International Inc and Canada's Ontario Hydro Inc bought a 60 percent stake in Luz del Sur, a former state-run electricity company for $212.1 million.</p>
<p>Another 10 percent stake is owned by the company's workers.</p>
