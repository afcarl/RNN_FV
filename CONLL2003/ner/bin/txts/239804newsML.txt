Colombia closes December coffee registrations.

BOGOTA 1996-12-06

Colombia's National Coffee Growers' Federation said in a statement that it was closing registrations for December coffee shipments by private exporters effective immediately.

The terse statement said the federation was closing the registrations because the monthly quota for private exporters of green coffee had already been filled.

Registrations for January and February shipment by private and federation exporters opened on Dec. 2.
