<p>Swedish giant L M Ericsson AB's local unit, forecasting fierce competition and explosive growth in Brazil's telecom sector starting next year, is digging in to defend its hefty stake in the equipment supply market.</p>
<p>&quot;Competition will be cutthroat,&quot; Carlos de Paiva Lopes, president of Ericsson Telecomunicacoes SA, told Reuters in an interview.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have 40 percent of the wireless market and our strategy will be to maintain that 40 percent,&quot; he added. &quot;It won't be easy.&quot;</p>
<p>Lopes predicts a stampede of equipment suppliers interested in Brazilian telecommunications next year, fueled by the some $8 billion in state investment and another $3 billion in private sector spending.</p>
<p>With the planned opening of cellular services to private capital and the break-up and privatization of the federal Telebras system, those numbers are expected to soar in subsequent years, he said.  </p>
<p>Much of the spending will go to meet massive pent-up demand for cellular lines and hand sets, something that has drawn the attention of every major wireless operator and equipment supplier in the world, Lopes said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're here. So is Motorola and Nokia,&quot; he said. &quot;That means the world's three leading manufacturers in the sector are here.&quot;</p>
<p>Ericsson AB increased its share in Ericsson Telecomunicacoes this week, boosting its stake in voting shares to 77 percent from its previous 26 percent. Until recently, Brazilian law forbade foreign companies from owning a majority of any telecom firm.</p>
<p>The stronger presence of the parent company makes it easier for the unit to engage in the bare-knuckles brawling likely to be unleashed in coming weeks when the government begins offering concessions to operate in Brazil's B Band cellular frequency.  </p>
<p>&quot;The company now has more weight. We also now have greater access to credit and financing,&quot; Lopes said, adding the purchase also means Brazil has become a priority for the Swedish telecom.</p>
<p>With good reason. Ericsson Telecomunicacoes, a main Telebras supplier that was a joint venture between Ericsson and two local partners, saw net sales surge to 532.8 million reais in the first nine months, versus 450 million reais for all of 1995.</p>
<p>Lopes said the firm expects similar growth next year mainly due to cellular equipment sales, now its main business.  </p>
<p>Following B Band privatizations, cellular market penetration in Brazil should rise to between 6 and 7 percent, or roughly to 10 million subscribers in three years, up from two million subscibers today, Lopes said.</p>
<p>&quot;That means eight million more subscribers in three years,&quot; he said, adding there should initially be enough business for Ericsson and its competitors.  </p>
<p>To grab some of the action, Ericsson plans to invest $50 million next year, including $30 million in a new cellular phone plant that will begin producing in 1997's first quarter. The factory will produce 500,000 hand sets next year and one million in 1998.</p>
<p>Despite concerns by some about possible delays in the B Band sell-off, Lopes is confident the government will not backtrack.</p>
<p>&quot;Things here in Brazil work like cooked spaghetti,&quot; he said. &quot;There's no straight line. But on Band B, we're beyond the point of no return.&quot;</p>
<p>And beyond the B Band, Brasilia also plans to offer private investors concessions to operate in the A Band, now the domain of state cellular operators, so business opportunities should abound for years to come, Lopes said.</p>
<p>&quot;The potential in Brazil is enormous,&quot; he said.</p>
