Brazil's CSN to build tin can plant.

SAO PAULO 1996-12-06

Brazilian steel mill Companhia Siderurgica Nacional said it will invest $70 million to build a tin can plant in the northeastern state of Ceara next year.

"The factory will start operating in the second half 1997 with an output capacity of 700 million cans a year," a company spokesman said.

The investment will allow CSN, Brazil's sole tin plate maker, to enter the country's promising can market. By year 2000 consumption is expected to jump to 12 billion cans a year from the current four billion.

CSN tin plates production is expected to reach 1 million metric tonnes in 1996, or six percent of the world's total production.
