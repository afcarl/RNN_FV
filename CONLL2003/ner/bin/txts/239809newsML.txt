CARACAS 1996-12-06

The average export price for Venezuela's basket of oil crudes and products rose by $1.68 cents to $22.10 per barrel on Friday, compared to $20.42 on November 29, the Energy and Mines Ministry said.

The average price for the year so far is $18.02 per barrel, the ministry statement said. Venezuela's oil export price averaged $14.84 per barrel last year compared to $13.23 per barrel in 1994.

The rise in oil prices this year has prompted the Venezuelan government to create a debt rescue fund which would use oil revenue windfalls to pay-off debt.

The Venezuelan government has based its recently revised 1996 budget proposal on an average price of $17.00 per barrel.

Oil accounts for some 40 percent of government revenues.
