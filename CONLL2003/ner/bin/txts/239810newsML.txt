Venezuela foreign reserves rise to $15.396 bln.

CARACAS 1996-12-06

Venezuela's total foreign reserves rose $43 million, or 0.3 percent, in the week to December 2 to $15.396 billion, according to new figures released by the central bank.

Reserves were up from $15.353 billion on November 25, the bank's latest weekly bulletin of indicators showed.  

Foreign reserves are now up $5.70 billion from reserve levels of $9.702 billion on April 19 -- the last working day before exchange levels were lifted on Monday April 22.

That rise, largely thanks to higher-than-expected international oil prices, exceeds government targets agreed with the IMF for a $1.5 billion increase by year-end.

The sustained rise has complicated monetary policy, government officials have said, increasing liquidity. Reserves are expected to top $16 billion by the end of 1996 and $20 billion by the end of 1997, officials have said.
