Argentina's Indupa resolves insolvency proceeding.

BUENOS AIRES 1996-12-06

Argentina's biggest PVC producer Indupa, which is controlled by Belgium's Solvay SA, said Friday it had finally been taken off preventive insolvency proceedings by an Argentine court.

The company said "this news was received with pleasure by the directors of the company."

Indupa sources said the company had been on preventive insolvency status since it was privatized and resolving this had been a priority for Solvay, which took control of Indupa by buying a majority stake from Dow Chemical Co and Argentine oil firm YPF in February.

"This was a pending legal issue which Solvay wanted to clear up when it bought Indupa," said a company source. "An agreement has been reached by which most of the debts have been cancelled and a sum of money has been deposited as a guarantee for creditors."
