<headline>Argentina's Indupa resolves insolvency proceeding.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Argentina's biggest PVC producer Indupa, which is controlled by Belgium's Solvay SA, said Friday it had finally been taken off preventive insolvency proceedings by an Argentine court.</p>
<p>The company said &quot;this news was received with pleasure by the directors of the company.&quot;</p>
<p>Indupa sources said the company had been on preventive insolvency status since it was privatized and resolving this had been a priority for Solvay, which took control of Indupa by buying a majority stake from Dow Chemical Co and Argentine oil firm YPF in February.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a pending legal issue which Solvay wanted to clear up when it bought Indupa,&quot; said a company source. &quot;An agreement has been reached by which most of the debts have been cancelled and a sum of money has been deposited as a guarantee for creditors.&quot;</p>
