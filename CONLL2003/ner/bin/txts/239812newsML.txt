Delays building hotels costing Cuba lost revenue.

HAVANA 1996-12-06

Delays completing new hotels in Cuba have cost the island some $41 million in lost tourism revenue, a senior official said in remarks published Friday.

Vice-president Carlos Lage, heading a meeting of tourism industry officials that was reported in the Communist Party newspaper Granma, cited construction delays as a key problem as Cuba seeks to expand the sector.

He said there had been delays in completion of some nine buildings -- 1,857 new hotel rooms -- and that this involved a loss of some $41 million in revenue. Lage did not specify the period in which this revenue was lost.

But the delays appear to be chronic. This time last year, President Fidel Castro blasted construction workers for failing to meet targets.

Communist-ruled Cuba expects to receive more than 900,000 foreign tourists this year, up from 740,000 in 1995.

The industry is now the country's main foreign exhange earner. The island has a target of two million visitors by the year 2000, which will involve doubling hotel capacity from the current figure of around 25,000 hotel rooms.
