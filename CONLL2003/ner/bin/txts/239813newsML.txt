Mexican peso claws back most of lost ground.

MEXICO CITY 1996-12-06

The Mexican peso recouped most of the ground it lost in early trade by midday on Friday on technicals and profit-taking on dollar gains, traders said.

"The peso weakened to a level that made it attractive to foreign buyers," said a trader.

"Several banks took profits," said another.

The benchmark 48-hour peso was 1.3 centavos weaker at 7.9050/7.908 per dollar, while its 24-hour counterpart was off 2.8 centavos to 7.905/7.910 per dollar.

Same-day contracts closed with the peso off 3.5 centavos at 7.9030/7.9080 per dollar.

Traders put initial demand for dollars down to jitters triggered by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan which had sent stock and bond markets reeling across the world.

Greenspan said in a speech on Thursday evening that the Federal Reserve had to be wary of "irrational exhuberance" in asset values.

The most immediate effect of Greenspan's remarks that hurt the peso, they said, was a climb in yields on the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond to 6.55 percent in early trade, compared to 6.32 in recent sessions.

Traders noted the peso had also recovered some of its lost ground as the long-bond rate had receded to 6.51 percent.

Dealers forecast a trading range of 7.90-7.95 per dollar for the 48-hour peso, and situated resistance at 7.96 per dollar.
