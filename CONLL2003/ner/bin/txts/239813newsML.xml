<headline>Mexican peso claws back most of lost ground.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>The Mexican peso recouped most of the ground it lost in early trade by midday on Friday on technicals and profit-taking on dollar gains, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The peso weakened to a level that made it attractive to foreign buyers,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>&quot;Several banks took profits,&quot; said another.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso was 1.3 centavos weaker at 7.9050/7.908 per dollar, while its 24-hour counterpart was off 2.8 centavos to 7.905/7.910 per dollar.</p>
<p>Same-day contracts closed with the peso off 3.5 centavos at 7.9030/7.9080 per dollar.</p>
<p>Traders put initial demand for dollars down to jitters triggered by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan which had sent stock and bond markets reeling across the world.</p>
<p>Greenspan said in a speech on Thursday evening that the Federal Reserve had to be wary of &quot;irrational exhuberance&quot; in asset values.</p>
<p>The most immediate effect of Greenspan's remarks that hurt the peso, they said, was a climb in yields on the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond to 6.55 percent in early trade, compared to 6.32 in recent sessions.</p>
<p>Traders noted the peso had also recovered some of its lost ground as the long-bond rate had receded to 6.51 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers forecast a trading range of 7.90-7.95 per dollar for the 48-hour peso, and situated resistance at 7.96 per dollar.</p>
