Mexican transport company Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM) and its U.S. partner may have overshot the mark in bidding for the government's Northeast Railway, analysts said on Friday.

TMM and minority partner Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. on Thursday offered 11.07 billion pesos (about $1.4 billion) to win a 50-year concession to operate Mexico's key trade route railroad.  

Compared with other railroads and annual income from the rail, he said the bid was a surprisingly high -- one that could reflect the companies' long-term strategic interests rather than the value of the route.

Analysts did have some positive things to say about the deal, however. Some said TMM's winning bid is a strategic boon in boosting volume and diversifying transportation holdings in the long-term.

The Northeast Railway system, which carries about 40 percent of Mexican rail exports, includes the main freight route between Mexico City and the U.S. border.
