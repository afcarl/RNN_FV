Colombia's coal reserves at 6 bln metric tons.

BOGOTA 1996-12-06

Colombia's coal reserves total an estimated 6.0 billion metric tons and it hopes to account for about 10 percent of world supply by the year 2000, according to Mines and Energy Minister Rodrigo Villamizar.

Villamizar, who spoke at a forum on the importance of coal in Colombia's energy sector, said the country's growing coal exports brought in $900 million in revenues this year.

He gave no specific figures on the volume of exports in 1996 but said Brazil was among the countries most interested in working together with the state-run coal company, Ecocarbon, to boost Colombia's importance as a world-class coal supplier.

A report released in Australia earlier this week by private commodities forecaster AME Mineral Economics said low cost coal exports from Colombia, Venezuela and Indonesia would dramatically lower average world steaming coal costs in the coming years.
