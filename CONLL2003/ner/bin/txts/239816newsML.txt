LIMA 1996-12-06

The Peruvian Congress approved Friday a new General Law for the Financial System updating regulations for the local bank and insurance sectors.

It is an extraordinary law, since it allows the modernization of our financial system to bring it in line with international standards,'' said Congress President Victor Joy Way.

It makes it more solid and competitive, so as to guarantee savings and credit.''

Officials and analysts said the law's most important changes are to lower to 11, by the year 2000, the maximum ratio of risk-weighted assets to net worth for commercial banks from the current value of 12.5; increase financial institutions' maximum levels of credit to businesses; and strengthen the role of the Superintendency of Banks and Insurance.
