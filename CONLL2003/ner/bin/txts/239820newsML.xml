<p>Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan said fourth quarter 1996 economic growth would be 6.5 percent and said gross domestic product for 1997 would be around 4.5 percent.</p>
<p>Speaking to businessmen, Malan said Brazil's 1996 and 1997 inflation rates would be in the single digits, an accomplishment not seen since the early 1950s.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably most of the people in this room were not alive the last time that happened,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Malan said Brazil's economic team saw no contradiction between a reduction in inflation and &quot;solid and sustained growth.</p>
<p>&quot;These are two elements that strengthen one another and we don't believe those who claim that they are incompatible,&quot; Malan said.</p>
<p>The minister said Brazil's November imports would be &quot;substantially&quot; lower than October, but he refused to say by how much.  </p>
<p>Brazil in October posted a record $1.31 billion trade deficit, reinforcing concerns about the country's external accounts.</p>
<p>However, Malan said the economic team's biggest challanges lie on the fiscal accounts side. The government, he added, would continue to make progress in improving efficiency in the use of public resources and in revenue collection.</p>
<p>He said he hoped the central government's privatization drive will be extended to the state and municipal level.</p>
<p>&quot;To those who ask me what to expect on the fiscal side, I say: 'Expect more of the same',&quot; he said, slipping into English.</p>
<p>Asked if the government was considering exempting stock transactions from the CPMF check tax, Malan responded that the Finance Ministry had received several proposals to that end.</p>
<p>He said no decision has been made yet and declined to speculate on what would be decided.</p>
