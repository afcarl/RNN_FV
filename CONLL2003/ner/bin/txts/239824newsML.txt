Eletrobras unit plans $90 mln bond issue.

SAO PAULO 1996-12-06

Brazilian power generator Furnas, a unit of state-owned Eletrobras, plans to launch a $90 million, dollar-denominated bond in the U.S. and European markets by mid-February, a company official said.

"We're still studying it," Fernando Pinheiro, Furnas' chief financial negotiators, told Reuters. "But the Eurobonds might have a maturity period of eight or five years."

He said the bonds will yield at least 10 percent a year, or 300 base points above 30-year U.S. treasuries.  

Furnas will likely choose a lead manager for the issue next week and hold road shows in the United States and Europe in January, he said.

Bond proceeds would be used to help finance Furnas' $1.2 billion project to boost generating capacity, said Pinheiro, adding the company is also negotiating a $300 million loan with German banks KFW International Finance and Dresdner Bank AG.

"The money will be used to pay for the construction of the Angra II nuclear plant," he said.

The loan will have a grace period of six months following completion of the project with a 12-year maturity, he added.

Angra II is expected to be completed in June 1999, so payments may not begin until December 1999, he said.

Furnas operates seven hydroelectric plants, three thermopower plants and two nuclear facilities, with a total generating capacity of 8,123 megawatts.
