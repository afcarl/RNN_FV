Mexico tweaks rice import rules, still favour U.S.

Mexico published new rules this week governing rice imports that still favour U.S grown grains but also pave the way for disease-free Asian varieties to re enter the country, sources said.

The government published new phytosanitary regulations in its Official Gazette, which basically modifies a blanket ban of imports from countries other than the United States to one specifying disease-free requirements.  

"The government has simply reinforced its ban of diseased rices," Antonio Lajud, the director of the Mexican Rice Council told Reuters.

"They have made the rules more clear, specifying which diseases appertain to which countries," said Lajud, whose umbrella group represents the country's 13,000 rice growers and the 23 major rice businesses.

"We are happy with the changes," he added, explaining the significance behind the seven-page adjustment in import regulations.  

Asian nations have long complained of the ban. In the year before the import restrictions, Mexico bought about 40,000 tonnes of medium grade 10-15 percent Thai white rice. Vietnam also sold rice to Mexico in the early 1990s, largely by heavily undercutting U.S. prices.

In August this year, rice markets believed Mexico was on the verge of totally lifting restrictions, which brought an outcry from the Mexican Rice Council believing the country could once again be open to rice diseases and crop failure.

Mexico's Agriculture Ministry remained tight-lipped for months, until it published the modified phytosanitary regulations this week.  

Mexico slapped a worldwide ban on rice imports back in 1992 after the national crop was decimated through disease believed to have been brought into the country via contaminated shipments from Asia.

The day following the ban, an exemption was made for imports from the United States, handing that nation the monopoly on rice trade with Mexico.

Mexico consumes around 400,000 tonnes of white rice per year, producing around half that amount and importing the other half from the United States.

Agriculture Ministry spokesmen were not immediately available for comment. Because of the politicized nature of Mexican agriculture, the ministry rarely makes known its stances other than through the Official Gazette.

Diseases the government mentioned are aphelenchoides besseyi, ditylenchus angustus, heterodera oryzae, hispa armigera, orseolia oryzivore, tilletia barclayana, xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola and white leaf virus, which has no scientific name.

Dozens of countries were named from the continents of Asia, Africa, the Americas, Europe and Oceania.
