An alleged corruption scandal involving a leader of a government-allied party in Brazil's Congress is unlikely to hinder, and may even help, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's re-election plan, political analysts said.

A congressional committee will investigate Deputy Pedrinho Abrao after a newspaper reported he demanded payment from a construction company in return for approval of a dam project it would carry out, an official said.  

O Globo newspaper alleged on Thursday that Abrao asked for four percent of a $42 million investment earmarked for the project in the 1997 federal government budget.

A spokesman for the Brazilian Labor Party (PTB), which principally represents the interests of big landowners and of which Abrao is lower house leader, said the deputy had resigned from a budget committee but denied the corruption allegations.

The opposition Brazilian Democratic Labor Party said it would seek to set up a wide-ranging Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry (CPI) to investigate the entire 1997 budget along the lines of a 1993 CPI which brought Congress to a standstill.  

And tempers flared on Thursday when a PTB deputy punched an official in the Environment Ministry where the report originated.

But analysts said the government had acted quickly by setting up the congressional committee to investigate Abrao and would probably avoid any major fallout from the scandal.

"They'll bury him quickly to avoid any contaminating effect on the political scene as a whole," said Carlos Setti of Goes e Consultores.  

Carlos Lopes of Santafe Ideias said the episode might help the government's ongoing drive to rally deputies behind a constitutional amendment, which would allow Cardoso to run again in 1998 and is due to be put to a lower house vote in January.

"The kind of deputies who demand favors in return for votes are going to be intimidated by this," Lopes said.

O Globo columnist Tereza Cruvinel agreed. "The deal-doers will have to close their gullets which will make negotiations (over re-election support) more political. The cost of re-election could be reduced," she wrote.

The government's leader in the lower house even saw a comical side to the scandal.

"It would be better if it never happened but low inflation has left its mark on corruption too. Before they used to ask for ten percent." the parliamentary leader, Deputy Benito Gama, said.
