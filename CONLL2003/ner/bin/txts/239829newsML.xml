<p>An alleged corruption scandal involving a leader of a government-allied party in Brazil's Congress is unlikely to hinder, and may even help, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's re-election plan, political analysts said.</p>
<p>A congressional committee will investigate Deputy Pedrinho Abrao after a newspaper reported he demanded payment from a construction company in return for approval of a dam project it would carry out, an official said.  </p>
<p>O Globo newspaper alleged on Thursday that Abrao asked for four percent of a $42 million investment earmarked for the project in the 1997 federal government budget.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Brazilian Labor Party (PTB), which principally represents the interests of big landowners and of which Abrao is lower house leader, said the deputy had resigned from a budget committee but denied the corruption allegations.</p>
<p>The opposition Brazilian Democratic Labor Party said it would seek to set up a wide-ranging Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry (CPI) to investigate the entire 1997 budget along the lines of a 1993 CPI which brought Congress to a standstill.  </p>
<p>And tempers flared on Thursday when a PTB deputy punched an official in the Environment Ministry where the report originated.</p>
<p>But analysts said the government had acted quickly by setting up the congressional committee to investigate Abrao and would probably avoid any major fallout from the scandal.</p>
<p>&quot;They'll bury him quickly to avoid any contaminating effect on the political scene as a whole,&quot; said Carlos Setti of Goes e Consultores.  </p>
<p>Carlos Lopes of Santafe Ideias said the episode might help the government's ongoing drive to rally deputies behind a constitutional amendment, which would allow Cardoso to run again in 1998 and is due to be put to a lower house vote in January.</p>
<p>&quot;The kind of deputies who demand favors in return for votes are going to be intimidated by this,&quot; Lopes said.</p>
<p>O Globo columnist Tereza Cruvinel agreed. &quot;The deal-doers will have to close their gullets which will make negotiations (over re-election support) more political. The cost of re-election could be reduced,&quot; she wrote.</p>
<p>The government's leader in the lower house even saw a comical side to the scandal.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be better if it never happened but low inflation has left its mark on corruption too. Before they used to ask for ten percent.&quot; the parliamentary leader, Deputy Benito Gama, said.</p>
