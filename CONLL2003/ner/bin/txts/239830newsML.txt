Argentines take bleak view on present, future - poll.

BUENOS AIRES 1996-12-06

More than 63 percent of Argentines believe the country is going through a bad or very bad period and a third believe the outlook for the next three years is equally grim, according to a poll published Friday.

Only 8.4 percent consider the current situation to be good or very good and 26 percent consider it "normal", the survey by pollsters Sofres-Ibope in the weekly business newspaper El Economista said.  

Only 3.5 percent have "very good" expectations for the next three years and 22.5 percent have good expectations. For 13.5 percent the outlook is normal, versus 20.4 percent who see the future very bleak and 12.7 percent who expect it to be bad.

Looking back at the past three years, 56 percent remember them as bad or very bad and only 15.1 percent have good or very good recent memories.

Sofres-Ibope director Enrique Zuleta Puceiro spoke in an accompanying analysis of "the collective bad mood." Argentines are "more and more convinced advances in the macroeconomy are not finding their way through to the microeconomy," he said.

But Zuleta Puceiro also pointed out that "pessimism and optimism are growing simultaneously" compared to the last poll in August, when the percentage taking a bright or very bright outlook on the next three years was only 15.4 percent.

El Economista did not publish technical details of the Sofres-Ibope opinion poll.
