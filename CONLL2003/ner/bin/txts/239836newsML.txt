Brazil industrial productivity to hit record-paper.

RIO DE JANEIRO 1996-12-06

Brazil's industrial production is seen growing only 1.5 percent in 1996, but productivity is likely to jump 12 percent, the highest rate this decade, a newspaper said.

A National Statistics Institute (IBGE) official, Silvio Sales, said the increase in productivity would cut the cost of goods and make them more competitive at home and abroad, O Globo said.

The downside was that the rise in productivity was accompanied by a high rate of unemployment, Sales said.
