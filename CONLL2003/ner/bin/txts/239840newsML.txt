A consortium led by Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM) entered the highest bid for Mexico's Northeast Railway, virtually assuring it will be chosen to run Mexico's first private rail line.

The consortium said it would operate the line as one leg in a rail system running all the way to Canada, but some analysts criticised the bid as exorbitant.

With a bid of 11.07 billion pesos (about $1.4 billion), the consortium, known as Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana (TFM), shot past competing bids of about 4.2 billion pesos to operate the key trade route of Mexico's railway system.

The two lower bids were registered by mining company Grupo Mexico and a consortium led by builder ICA SA and Union Pacific Corp.

The government is set to decide on the bids on December 12.

"I believe this is a great opportunity and confirms our decision to have a railroad from Mexico City to Chicago and from there to Canada," TMM president Juan Carlos Merodio told reporters after sealed envelopes containing the competitors' bids were opened in a tense ceremony.  

He said the Northeast Railway is a strategic link for the partnership, which is 51 percent represented by TMM and 49 percent by Kansas City Southern Industries Inc..

The route connects Mexico City to key ports and links the Mexican city of Monterrey with Laredo across the U.S. border. TMM affiliate Texmex owns the southern half of a cross-border bridge linking Laredo and Nuevo Laredo. From there, Kansas City Southern operates a rail line to Canada, Merodio said.

"Railroads carry only 15 percent of cargo in Mexico, which means 85 percent is carried in vehicles. There is a lot of competition and also a great potential," said Aaron Dychter, coordinator of Mexico's railroad privatisation.

Private ownership should create "a railroad more efficient, secure and competitive, while conserving an important source of jobs," the government's railroad operators, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico, said.

Despite acknowledging the advantage of a congruous railroad system through North America, analysts said they were initially "stunned by" and "sceptical" of TFM's bid.  

The government confirmed TFM's offered price was above the minimum required bid, set by an independent assessment of the railroad's worth. Government officials refused to disclose at what price the assessors valued the railroad's assets.

"Until the amount of the technical estimate is disclosed, it is difficult to say if the company is paying a lot or if they are geniuses," said an analyst who asked not to be named.

Other analysts said TFM was paying more than 11 times the railroad's annual income of about $125 million. A general perception the firm offered too much for the track could drag down TMM's stock's price in trading on Friday, analysts said.

The company was scheduled to hold a news conference on Friday to elaborate on its bid and plans for the railroad.

The winning bidder gets 80 percent of the railroad's stock, with 20 percent floated on the Mexican Stock Exchange over two years. If the stock is not sold, the concessionaire is required to buy the remaining shares.
