Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM) and Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. bid $1.4 billion for Mexico's Northeast Railway on Thursday, the highest to operate the first private rail track in Mexico.

The consortium made up of the two companies said the key rail route in Mexico would set the stage for a rail system running through North America.

"I believe this is a great opportunity and confirms our decision to have a railroad from Mexico City to Chicago and from there to Canada," TMM president Juan Carlos Merodio told reporters after sealed envelopes containing the competitors' bids were opened in a tense ceremony.

With the bid of 11.07 billion pesos ($1.4 billion), the consortium known as Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana (TFM) shot past competing bids of about 4.2 billion pesos and shocked some analysts who described the bid as high.

The two lower bids were registered by mining company Grupo Mexico and a consortium led by builder ICA SA and Union Pacific Corp.

The concession to operate the railroad hinges on government approval, with a decision scheduled for Dec. 12.

Merodio said the Northeast Railway is a strategic link for the partnership, which is 51 percent owned by TMM and 49 percent by Kansas City Southern.

The route connects Mexico City to key ports and the cities of Monterrey and Laredo, where TMM affiliate Texmex owns the southern half of a cross-border bridge to Nuevo Laredo. From there, Kansas City Southern has track to Canada, Merodio said.

"Railroads carry only 15 percent of cargo in Mexico, which means 85 percent is carried in vehicles. There is a lot of competition and also a great potential," said Aaron Dychter, coordinator of Mexico's railroad privatisation.

Private ownership should create "a railroad more efficient, secure and competitive, while conserving an important source of jobs," the government's railroad operators, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico, said.

Despite acknowledging the advantage of a linked railroad system through North America, analysts said they were initially stunned by the high amount of TFM's bid.

One analyst said TFM was paying more than 11 times the railroad's annual income of about $125 million.
