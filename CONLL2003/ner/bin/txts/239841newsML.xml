<p>Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM) and Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. bid $1.4 billion for Mexico's Northeast Railway on Thursday, the highest to operate the first private rail track in Mexico.</p>
<p>The consortium made up of the two companies said the key rail route in Mexico would set the stage for a rail system running through North America.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe this is a great opportunity and confirms our decision to have a railroad from Mexico City to Chicago and from there to Canada,&quot; TMM president Juan Carlos Merodio told reporters after sealed envelopes containing the competitors' bids were opened in a tense ceremony.</p>
<p>With the bid of 11.07 billion pesos ($1.4 billion), the consortium known as Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana (TFM) shot past competing bids of about 4.2 billion pesos and shocked some analysts who described the bid as high.</p>
<p>The two lower bids were registered by mining company Grupo Mexico and a consortium led by builder ICA SA and Union Pacific Corp.</p>
<p>The concession to operate the railroad hinges on government approval, with a decision scheduled for Dec. 12.</p>
<p>Merodio said the Northeast Railway is a strategic link for the partnership, which is 51 percent owned by TMM and 49 percent by Kansas City Southern.</p>
<p>The route connects Mexico City to key ports and the cities of Monterrey and Laredo, where TMM affiliate Texmex owns the southern half of a cross-border bridge to Nuevo Laredo. From there, Kansas City Southern has track to Canada, Merodio said.</p>
<p>&quot;Railroads carry only 15 percent of cargo in Mexico, which means 85 percent is carried in vehicles. There is a lot of competition and also a great potential,&quot; said Aaron Dychter, coordinator of Mexico's railroad privatisation.</p>
<p>Private ownership should create &quot;a railroad more efficient, secure and competitive, while conserving an important source of jobs,&quot; the government's railroad operators, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico, said.</p>
<p>Despite acknowledging the advantage of a linked railroad system through North America, analysts said they were initially stunned by the high amount of TFM's bid.</p>
<p>One analyst said TFM was paying more than 11 times the railroad's annual income of about $125 million.</p>
