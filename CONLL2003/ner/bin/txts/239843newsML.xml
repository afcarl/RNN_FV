<p>Chile and Mexico will start negotiations next year to broaden their free trade agreement to include services and investments, Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said.</p>
<p>Chile hopes to broaden the treaty signed in 1994 beyond reduction of tariffs on imports and exports and add provisions covering services and investment codes, said Aninat.</p>
<p>Both areas tend to more laden with friction in free trade negotiations than tariff reduction.</p>
<p>''In January or February, we'll have some very close contacts with Mexico to add the issue of services and advance on the issue of investments,'' Aninat told reporters after signing a free trade deal with Canada.</p>
<p>''We want to give the treaty between Mexico and Chile greater depth and coverage than it has now. It's very good now, but it practically only covers trade in goods,'' he said.</p>
<p>Aninat also said he was confident the Chilean Congress would ratify the treaty with Congress quickly.</p>
<p>''The reactions from business and unions which I have seen have been almost unanimously positive, so I don't see any problem,'' he said.</p>
