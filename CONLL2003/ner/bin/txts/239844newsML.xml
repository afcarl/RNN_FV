<headline>Chile takes step closer to NAFTA with Canada deal.</headline>

<p>Chile and Canada signed a free trade deal Thursday that will erase tariffs on most of their bilateral commerce and which both sides said will help pave the way for Chile eventually to join NAFTA.</p>
<p>After a year's negotiations, Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat signed the treaty's final texts in Spanish, English and French for Chile, and International Trade Minister Art Eggleton did the same for Canada at a ceremony with President Eduardo Frei.</p>
<p>Frei and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien signed a draft of the agreement in Ottawa on Nov. 18.</p>
<p>Assuming both countries' legislatures approve the deal, it will erase tariffs immediately on 80 percent of trade between the two countries at either extreme of the Americas, and phase out almost all the rest over 18 years. Canada's imports coming into Chile are currently subject to a uniform 11 percent tariff.</p>
<p>The treaty's basic terms mirror those of the North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico, including provisions for free trade in banking and other services and in side agreements covering labour and environmental issues.</p>
<p>&quot;This will serve as a useful bridge to reach NAFTA because it uses the exact same language as NAFTA,&quot; said Aninat, while Eggleton called the agreement &quot;the pavement that will take us&quot; to the entrance of Chile into NAFTA as its fourth member.</p>
<p>&quot;On closing this agreement, we're opening up many more opportunities that we have to make the most of,&quot; Frei told reporters after the signing.</p>
<p>With a free trade treaty already signed with Mexico and now Canada, Chile has trade deals with two out of three NAFTA partners. But before talks can start for Chile to join, the U.S. Congress must approve fast-track authority for U.S. trade negotiators, which politicians say won't happen until mid-1997 at the earliest.</p>
<p>Just as Aninat and Eggleton signed the treaty, Chile's Central Bank announced it was easing a requirement that foreign investors put 30 percent of the money they send into Chile in reserve at the bank. Investors have long chafed at the rule, and Canada unsuccessfully tried to have it eliminated under the trade deal.</p>
<p>The Central Bank said it was dropping the reserve requirement on investments of up to $500,000 invested over a year's time and on loans of up to $200,000.</p>
<p>Aninat denied any connection between the Central Bank announcement and the trade deal, though it was long a point of contention in talks.</p>
