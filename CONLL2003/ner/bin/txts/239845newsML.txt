Costa Rican consumer prices rose 1.02 percent in November, down from the 1.3 percent rise recorded in October, the government said Thursday.

Higher food costs for eggs, powdered milk, cabbage, tomatoes and soft drinks fueled much of the increase, Economy Minister Jose Leon Desanti told a news conference.

Desanti said the goverment expects inflation to end the year at 14 percent, down from 22.6 percent last year.

Year-over-year inflation was 13.96 through the end of November, down from the 24.93 percent for the December 1994 through November 1995.
