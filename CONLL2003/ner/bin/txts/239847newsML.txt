Colombia oil workers threathen indefinite strike.

BOGOTA 1996-12-05

Colombia's main oil workers' union will begin an indefinite strike "soon after" an extraordinary meeting Monday, December 9, the union's leader, Hernando Hernandez, said on Thursday.

The strike could extend to workers in private oil companies, including foreign multinationals, following the main USO union's merger with smaller labor organizations in the sector last month.
