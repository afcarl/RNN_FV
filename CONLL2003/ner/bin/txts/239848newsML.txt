Two Peruvian soldiers were killed when they stepped on landmines that were laid last year by the Ecuadoran army during the two Andean neighbours' brief border war, Peru's military said on Thursday.

The explosion late on Wednesday injured two other soldiers, and followed the death last month of another Peruvian soldier who triggered a mine in the same border area, the joint military command said in a statement.

Tension has been rising between the two countries since Peru's recent purchase of a squadron of sophisticated MiG-29 fighter jets.

Quito has claimed the purchase was excessive and could lead to an arms race. Early last year Peru and Ecuador fought an undeclared war over a decades-old territorial dispute, which left scores dead and hundreds injured on both sides.
