<p>Prepare for the big budget bash.</p>
<p>Immediately after the final Telstra privatisation vote on Monday, the government will start pumping budget bills into the Senate, successive votes of the upper house deciding the fate of fully a quarter of Treasurer Peter Costello's fiscal tightening.</p>
<p>And it all has to be over by Friday, the last sitting day of 1996.</p>
<p>Forget the other three quarters of the budget -- it has quietly passed already or will do so with the backing of Labor, the Democrats or both.</p>
<p>ut those two parties are opposed measures that would cut about A$1.7 billion from the 1997/98 budget, compared with the total A$7.2 billion tightening that the government announced in August.</p>
<p>Without Labor or Democrat support, the government will have to rely on the votes of either the Greens or the Independents.</p>
<p>As experienced Canberra Watchers will quickly realise, that really means that the government will have to rely on the Independents, since the Greens tend to find reasons to oppose most budget measures.</p>
<p>So Independent senators Mal Colston and Brian Harradine have a quarter of Costello's budget in their hands.</p>
<p>To put next week into context, the measures that Colston and Harradine will determine next week are greater than the entire fiscal effect of most budgets.</p>
<p>To date, just one of the big contentious budget bills has survived the upper house -- the hike in university charges -- and it was the Independents that delivered it.</p>
<p>That and a few other votes suggest that Colston and Harradine will be co-operative. But there is absolutely no firm evidence that the contentious budget bills are safe.</p>
<p>For the government, the cruel fact of the matter is that if either Colston or Harradine dislike the research and development changes, for example, then budget savings worth about A$700 million a year go straight down the plughole.</p>
<p>Remember: the government is two votes short of a majority in the Senate, so it needs both Independents.</p>
<p>A particular highlight of the week will be a return appearance of the bill to exclude newly arrived migrants from social security.</p>
<p>The Senate has already savaged that bill (cost: A$130 million a year) but the government is bringing it back to the upper house, stamping its foot and insisting that the honourable senators think again.</p>
