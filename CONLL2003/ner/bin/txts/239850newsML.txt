Burmese authorities deployed several hundred armed troops around the University of Yangon on Friday as a student protest demanding the release of detained colleagues grew in size, witnesses said.

Soldiers and police set up roadblocks at all access roads leading to the students' rallying point, at a junction about 500 metres (yards) from a gate of the university.

Several fire engines and prison vans were also parked near the area, witnesses said.

They said at least 500 students had joined the rally by late on Friday to demand greater justice and call on the government to free 80 of their colleagues said to be still in detention.

Education Minister Pan Aung and other government and university officials earlier tried to talk to student leaders to persuade them to leave.

A spokesman for Burma's ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) had said no action was being taken against the students.

"We have not taken any action against them now. The minister is talking to them and we expect it to be over," the spokesman told Reuters.

The students are demanding the right to form student unions in campuses.

"We are true students. If they (police) shoot we are prepared to die," one student told Reuters. "We want about 80 of our student leaders to be freed. We want to form our student unions."

The students sang patriotic songs and carried pictures of Burma's founding father Aung San and legendary poet Thakhin Kodaw Hmine, both heroes of the Burmese fight for independence from the British, the witnesses said.

Earlier in the afternoon, a separate group of about 200 Burmese students marched briefly from the troubled Yangon Institute of Technology in northern Rangoon towards the university six km (four miles) away, but then returned to their campus.

On Monday and Tuesday, students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October.

The students also demanded the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in the October brawl.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was restricted to her home by the Burmese government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests. She was allowed to move freely on Thursday.

The students on Friday stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD).

Key NLD officials and Suu Kyi -- a Nobel laureate and daughter of Aung San -- have denied any link with the students. But they have said there is a "moral link" between them in that they were against police brutality and injustice.

On Friday, the road leading to Suu Kyi's lakeside residence in central Rangoon remained closed by police.
