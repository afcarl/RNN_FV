Japan and the United States failed Friday to bridge wide differences over the deregulation of Tokyo's insurance market in last-ditch efforts to resolve the issue before a Dec. 15 deadline, officials said.

"There are certainly wide differences between us," Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told reporters after negotiations with Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka.

They started a ministerial meeting Friday (corrects from Monday) and were scheduled to meet again Saturday -- which both sides have said would be the last opportunity to meet before the deadline.

Emerging from the first meeting with Mitsuzuka, Barshefsky said, however, that the meeting was "constructive."

The dispute has become a major irriant between the two countries, and could escalate into a damaging trade fight with threats of sanctions similar to ones that have marked U.S.-Japan relations in the past.

The fight centres on U.S. charges that Japan is planning to renege on a 1994 trade agreement on the deregulation of its $400 billion insurance market.

Asked if they can reach an agreement during the latest round of talks, Mitsuzuka said, "It's very difficult do do so."

Barshefsky said senior officials of the U.S. Trade Representative's Office and the Finance Ministry would continue to work toward an agreement in advance of her meeting with Mitsuzuka Saturday.

"We shall see whether further progress can be made. But there are very, very difficult issues," Barshefsky said.

Japan allowed subsidiaries of domestic life and non-life insurers to start operations in each other's turfs Oct 1, but barred them from selling some products in a third market sector -- stand-alone cancer, hospitalization, nursing care and personal accident insurance -- before next year.

Washington has argued that the 1994 agreement calls for Tokyo to deregulate the huge primary life and casualty insurance sector, which is dominated by Japanese companies, before unleasing competition in the tiny speciality insurance market.

But the Tokyo government has proposed first deregulating the foreign-dominated sector. U.S. insurers like American International Group have a firm foothold in the lucrative third sector.

Last month, President Clinton told Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in a meeting on the fringes of a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Manila that the dispute over deregulation of Japan's insurance market was their most serious two-way trade problem.
