Vietnam wins record aid pledge, spur for reform.

Vietnam won its biggest-ever aid package from an increasingly sympathetic donor community on Friday, but not without a warning that the pace and scope of its reform drive urgently needs to be stepped up.

The World Bank, which chaired an annual pledging session in Hanoi, said donor nations and agencies committed $2.4 billion to back structural reform and the government's ambitious five-year economic plan.

That sum, some $400 million in excess of expectations, took aid pledges since the communist country returned to the fold of the international financial community in 1993 to $8.5 billion.

"There's a clear recognition in the international community that Vietnam is still a very poor country and that it has embarked on a truly remarkable transformation," said Javad Shirazi, chairman of the World Bank's Consultative Group for Vietnam.

"And, therefore, on both of those accounts it deserves strong and continued support," Shirazi told a news conference after the two-day meeting.

Vietnam's Communist Party agreed at a landmark meeting earlier this year to press ahead with the cautious experiment in capitalist-style economic reforms that it began a decade ago.

Its so-called "doi moi" (renovation) drive has spawned stellar economic growth, averaging over eight percent since 1991, and lifted living standards off the floor.

Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai told the meeting Vietnam was still a long way off a healthy market economy and reeled off a litany of woes: a fast-widening wealth gap, unemployment, poor schooling and health care, growing crime and serious drug abuse.

Minister of Planning and Investment Tran Xuan Gia, in an unusually critical assessment, added in a speech later that "the country's financial capability is still on a shoestring".

Diplomats, noting that pledges to Hanoi have risen every year despite shrinking aid budgets worldwide, said the donor community hardly needed such encouragement to give more support.

However, Hanoi was warned again at the meeting that there must be no backsliding on trade liberalisation and that its sprawling state sector must not be allowed to continue in a muddle of waste and bureaucracy.

The government was urged to give the still nascent private sector a chance to thrive and improve the environment for foreign investors, who have become increasingly frustrated with an opaque legal framework, high costs and endless red tape.

The donors agreed that since Vietnam had opened its doors to the outside world, albeit gingerly, new and more complex problems now faced the authorities.

Among those was the sudden emergence of a current account deficit, which now stands at 12 percent of national income.

"Deficits of this magnitude would not be sustainable and would jeopardize Vietnam's future creditworthiness and its ability to sustain high growth over the medium term," the World Bank said in a statement.

The World Bank is one of Vietnam's top donors along with the Asian Development Bank and Japan, which this year pledged more than $800 million.
