<p>Vietnam won its biggest-ever aid package from an increasingly sympathetic donor community on Friday, but not without a warning that the pace and scope of its reform drive urgently needs to be stepped up.</p>
<p>The World Bank, which chaired an annual pledging session in Hanoi, said donor nations and agencies committed $2.4 billion to back structural reform and the government's ambitious five-year economic plan.</p>
<p>That sum, some $400 million in excess of expectations, took aid pledges since the communist country returned to the fold of the international financial community in 1993 to $8.5 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a clear recognition in the international community that Vietnam is still a very poor country and that it has embarked on a truly remarkable transformation,&quot; said Javad Shirazi, chairman of the World Bank's Consultative Group for Vietnam.</p>
<p>&quot;And, therefore, on both of those accounts it deserves strong and continued support,&quot; Shirazi told a news conference after the two-day meeting.</p>
<p>Vietnam's Communist Party agreed at a landmark meeting earlier this year to press ahead with the cautious experiment in capitalist-style economic reforms that it began a decade ago.</p>
<p>Its so-called &quot;doi moi&quot; (renovation) drive has spawned stellar economic growth, averaging over eight percent since 1991, and lifted living standards off the floor.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai told the meeting Vietnam was still a long way off a healthy market economy and reeled off a litany of woes: a fast-widening wealth gap, unemployment, poor schooling and health care, growing crime and serious drug abuse.</p>
<p>Minister of Planning and Investment Tran Xuan Gia, in an unusually critical assessment, added in a speech later that &quot;the country's financial capability is still on a shoestring&quot;.</p>
<p>Diplomats, noting that pledges to Hanoi have risen every year despite shrinking aid budgets worldwide, said the donor community hardly needed such encouragement to give more support.</p>
<p>However, Hanoi was warned again at the meeting that there must be no backsliding on trade liberalisation and that its sprawling state sector must not be allowed to continue in a muddle of waste and bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The government was urged to give the still nascent private sector a chance to thrive and improve the environment for foreign investors, who have become increasingly frustrated with an opaque legal framework, high costs and endless red tape.</p>
<p>The donors agreed that since Vietnam had opened its doors to the outside world, albeit gingerly, new and more complex problems now faced the authorities.</p>
<p>Among those was the sudden emergence of a current account deficit, which now stands at 12 percent of national income.</p>
<p>&quot;Deficits of this magnitude would not be sustainable and would jeopardize Vietnam's future creditworthiness and its ability to sustain high growth over the medium term,&quot; the World Bank said in a statement.</p>
<p>The World Bank is one of Vietnam's top donors along with the Asian Development Bank and Japan, which this year pledged more than $800 million.</p>
