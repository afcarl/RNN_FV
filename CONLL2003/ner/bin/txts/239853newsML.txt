Burmese authorities confronted about 400 students who gathered on Friday outside the University of Yangon demanding the government free their detained colleagues and calling for greater justice, witnesses said.

A spokesman for Burma's ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) said no action was taken against the students and that the Education Minister Pan Aung and senior officials were trying to persuade student leaders to disperse.

"We have not taken any action against them now. The minister is talking to them and we expect it to be over," the spokesman told Reuters.

Witnesses said the atmosphere was peaceful with no police in sight.

The students said some 80 of their colleagues were still being detained and should be freed. They demanded justice and more rights and said they wanted authorities to allow them to form student unions in campuses, witnesses said.

"We are true students. If they (police) shoot we are prepared to die," one of the students told Reuters. "We want about 80 of our student leaders to be freed. We want to form our student unions."

The students sang patriotic songs and carried pictures of Burma's founding father Aung San and legendary poet Thakhin Kodaw Hmine, both heroes during the Burmese fight for independence from the British, the witnesses said.

Earlier, a separate group of about 200 Burmese students marched briefly from the troubled Yangon Institute of Technology in northern Rangoon towards the university six km (four miles) away, but returned to their campus.

Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute.

There were no clashes.

"They are now back in the YIT campus," an institute official who declined to be identified told Reuters by telephone.

One of two roads leading to the University of Yangon from the institute had been closed by authorities.

On Monday and Tuesday, students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October.

Those protesting students also demanded that the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in the October brawl.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was restricted to her home by the Burmese government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests. She was allowed to move freely on Thursday.

The students on Friday stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD).

Key NLD officials and Suu Kyi -- a Nobel laureate and daughter of Aung San -- have denied any link with the students. But they have said there is a "moral link" between them in that they were against police brutality and injustice.

On Friday, the road leading to Suu Kyi's lakeside residence in central Rangoon remained closed by police.
