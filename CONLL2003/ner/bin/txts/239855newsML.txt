British and Chinese negotiators said on Friday they had agreed to adjust Hong Kong's anti-espionage law to make it compatible with the colony's future status as a special region of China after 1997.

Chinese and British team leaders in the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) said after three days of talks the countries agreed that Britain's official secrets act would be localised.

"The official secrets act is a British law...which was extended to Hong Kong. Hong Kong has not got its own official secrets act so we are talking about the localisation of the act in Hong Kong," China's Zhao Jihua told a news conference.

Britain's Hugh Davies confirmed the accord. "It is good news that we have been able to ensure that legislation on this sensitive subject can be introduced under British sovereignty in a form that will survive the transition," he said.

The British envoy said no major changes would be made to the anti-spy law except to bring it up to date and make it useable in Hong Kong beyond the handover in 207 days' time.

Speaking amid heightened anxiety over the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, Zhao tried to reassure local people they would continue to have complete freedom of movement after 1997.

"For Hong Kong residents, they can rest assured that the freedom of entry and exit into and out of Hong Kong will continue to be guaranteed," Zhao said.

The two sides made progress in discussions on residence rights, but failed to reach a final agreement on the complex issue, which is of great concern for hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong people who have acquired foreign citizenships.

The British negotiator sought to assure such people that they did not need to rush back to the territory before July 1, next year, in order to retain their Hong Kong residency.

Davies defended last week's move by Britain to draft an anti-subversion bill for Hong Kong, a law that sets legal markers against China-style jailings of dissidents.

China reacted angrily to the move when it was announced, while Britain accused Beijing of blocking efforts to draft laws on subversion, sedition and treason for the handover.

Davies said it was an "unhappy decision" that they had to proceed without Beijing's consent because the Chinese side had refused to discuss the matter and the British had no choice but to introduce the law on their own.

Zhao warned Britain on Friday not to rock the boat by making further major legal changes on its own, or it could hamper the smooth handover of the territory of 6.3 million people next July 1.

"We certainly hope it won't affect our relations," Zhao said. "But I can't deny that it will definitely affect future discussions."

Zhao said Britain had violated the 1984 Joint Declaration, the Sino-British handover treaty, and Hong Kong's future constitution, the Basic Law.

"This is a breach of the Joint Declaration. This act is attempting to legislate on behalf of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China. In essense this is an act which is in contravention of the Basic Law.

"Such an act will never be acceptable to the Chinese side and the British side has to bear full responsibility for all the consequences," Zhao said.
