<title>EAST TIMOR: Indonesia's Belo leaves for Nobel award ceremony.</title>
<headline>Indonesia's Belo leaves for Nobel award ceremony.</headline>
<dateline>DILI, East Timor 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>East Timorese Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo left Dili on Friday on his way to Norway for the awards ceremony as co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Belo left the territory for the Indonesian capital Jakarta accompanied by five other people. It was not immediately known when he would arrive in Oslo.</p>
<p>The bishop will jointly receive the Nobel award next Tuesday with East Timorese-born activist Jose Ramos Horta, who lives in self-exile in Australia.</p>
<p>The Indonesian government has condemned the inclusion of Ramos Horta in the award, and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Friday that Indonesia would not be represented officially at the ceremony in the Norwegian capital.</p>
<p>&quot;I sincerely believe that this unfortunate choice in giving the honour to such a controversial figure as Ramos Horta...will exacerbate the problem in finding a solution (to East Timor),&quot; Alatas said on Friday.</p>
<p>He was responding to questions at a news conference called to discuss next week's ministerial meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in Jakarta.</p>
<p>Ramos Horta has been a vocal leader of the opposition to Jakarta's rule in the territory.</p>
<p>Belo and Ramos Horta were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year. The United Nations has never recognised Jakarta's move.</p>
<p>Alatas said the government's position on the Nobel Peace Prize would have been different if it had been awarded solely to Belo.</p>
<p>Asked if the Indonesian ambassador to Norway would have attended the ceremony if only Belo had been involved, Alatas replied: &quot;Probably, yes, but that is a hypothetical question.&quot;</p>
<p>Alatas said on Tuesday that on his way back from Oslo, Belo would visit the Vatican to see the Pope, and would also meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn.</p>
<p>Kohl had wanted to meet Belo during the chancellor's official visit to Indonesia last month, but the bishop was too busy in East Timor to come to Jakarta.</p>
