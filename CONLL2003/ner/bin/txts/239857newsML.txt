-------- COMMENTS - Singapore bunker prices stayed steady on Friday amid very thin talks, traders said. Uncertain market directions and lacklustre interest in the cargo market has dampened talks in the bunker market, traders said. But MDO and gas oil prices continued firm on strong gas oil levels which reached a new-five-year peak.
