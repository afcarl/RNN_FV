Donors back Vietnam reforms with $2.4 billion.

HANOI 1996-12-06

Donor nations and agencies pledged aid totalling $2.4 billion to Vietnam for 1997, the World Bank said at the end of a two-day Consultative Group meeting in Hanoi on Friday.

"As a vivid demonstration of confidence in Vietnam, the donors pledged $2.4 billion for 1997 to support structural reforms and the implementation of the new plan, an amount which exceeeds the $2 billion recommended by the World Bank," it said in a statement.

The latest aid commitments, slightly more than the $2.3 billion pledged at last year's annual meeting in Paris, brought total pledges of official development assistance (ODA) since 1993 to $8.5 billion.

Diplomats said the amount for 1997 was higher than expected because Japan, the largest single donor, came in with more aid than expected.

During the meeting, donors praised the communist country's decade-old reform process, which has brought average economic growth of more than eight percent for the past five years and lifted living standards off the floor.  

However, they also urged Hanoi to do more in a number of areas including trade liberalisation, state enterprise reform and in the creation of a more competitive economic environment.

Roy Morey of the United Nations Development Programme told Reuters there had been a strong convergence of views among donors, who had cautioned Hanoi about the economic difficulties it would have to overcome.

"The message was: 'it's not that you're off the track, it's just that the slope of the track is steeper now'," he said.

Vietnam's Communist Party agreed at a landmark meeting earlier this year to continue economic reforms begun in the late 1980s, but conservatives have argued that the country's economic and social opening could loosen the party's grip on power.
