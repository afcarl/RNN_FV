South Korea told France on Friday that many people were "worried" by the decision to delay the privatisation of electronics giant Thomson SA, and it was closely watching how the matter developed.

In the latest twist in a saga that has changed from a business row to a high level government-to-government issue, Deputy Prime Minister Han Seung-soo also indirectly warned of a possible impact on wider economic relations.

Han spelled out Seoul's concerns during a meeting with French Ambassador Dominique Perreau, while the South Korean firm at the centre of the controversy made clear it still wanted a part in the privatisation of Thomson.

On Wednesday, the French government backed away from its decision to privatise state-owned Thomson SA after a privatisation commission challenged Daewoo's involvement.

Under the plan, France was to have sold loss-making Thomson to electronics group Lagardere, which then planned to sell Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics Co Ltd.

The privatisation committee said in a report that the Daewoo deal did not fully reflect the value of Thomson's technology in digital decoders and flat screens.

"It is true that this decision has caused worries to many people who want to expand economic cooperation between Korea and France," Finance Ministry official Kim Seung-jin Kim quoted Han as telling the French envoy in a late afternoon meeting.

"I hope this incident will not affect cooperative economic relations between the two countries. We will watch the steps and procedures the privatisation committee will take in the future," Han said.

Perreau told Han that future developments in the privatisation process would be transparent, and Paris would keep the South Korean government informed of the steps it will take.

Several hours before the meeting, top Daewoo Group executives gathered to discuss their next move.

"Of course we haven't abandoned our plan," Daewoo Group spokesman Lee Jung-seung said after the gathering.

"Since this is not a rejection of privatisation, Daewoo will develop a policy based on its understanding of the situation and future developments," he said.

While Daewoo officials described Friday's meeting as a "regular" gathering of affiliate presidents to mark the return of group chairman Kim Woo-choong from a trip to Malaysia, other sources said the Thomson situation topped the agenda.

The purchase of Thomson would have made Daewoo Electronics a major world player in electronics, transforming it from a relative unknown into the world's biggest maker of televisions with established brand names and cutting-edge technology.

"It's going to become much more of a Korea-France thing than just between Thomson and Daewoo," said Bruce Gonyea, regional electronics analyst for Paribas Capital Markets in Singapore and a former Daewoo employee.

"Korean companies have power projects and construction projects in France, and the Korean government is in a good bargaining position," he said.

In 1995, France and South Korea enjoyed bilateral trade worth $3.42 billion, up from $2.8 billion the previous year, French Trade Commission figures show.

The hiccup in Daewoo's plans could bode ill for French businesses in South Korea, industry sources said. "I'm afraid there may be some bad impact," said Jean-Jacque Grauhar, director of the European Union Chamber of Commerce. "Some politicians are using very hard words toward France."
