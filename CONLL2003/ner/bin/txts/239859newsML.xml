<p>South Korea told France on Friday that many people were &quot;worried&quot; by the decision to delay the privatisation of electronics giant Thomson SA, and it was closely watching how the matter developed.</p>
<p>In the latest twist in a saga that has changed from a business row to a high level government-to-government issue, Deputy Prime Minister Han Seung-soo also indirectly warned of a possible impact on wider economic relations.</p>
<p>Han spelled out Seoul's concerns during a meeting with French Ambassador Dominique Perreau, while the South Korean firm at the centre of the controversy made clear it still wanted a part in the privatisation of Thomson.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the French government backed away from its decision to privatise state-owned Thomson SA after a privatisation commission challenged Daewoo's involvement.</p>
<p>Under the plan, France was to have sold loss-making Thomson to electronics group Lagardere, which then planned to sell Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics Co Ltd.</p>
<p>The privatisation committee said in a report that the Daewoo deal did not fully reflect the value of Thomson's technology in digital decoders and flat screens.</p>
<p>&quot;It is true that this decision has caused worries to many people who want to expand economic cooperation between Korea and France,&quot; Finance Ministry official Kim Seung-jin Kim quoted Han as telling the French envoy in a late afternoon meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope this incident will not affect cooperative economic relations between the two countries. We will watch the steps and procedures the privatisation committee will take in the future,&quot; Han said.</p>
<p>Perreau told Han that future developments in the privatisation process would be transparent, and Paris would keep the South Korean government informed of the steps it will take.</p>
<p>Several hours before the meeting, top Daewoo Group executives gathered to discuss their next move.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we haven't abandoned our plan,&quot; Daewoo Group spokesman Lee Jung-seung said after the gathering.</p>
<p>&quot;Since this is not a rejection of privatisation, Daewoo will develop a policy based on its understanding of the situation and future developments,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While Daewoo officials described Friday's meeting as a &quot;regular&quot; gathering of affiliate presidents to mark the return of group chairman Kim Woo-choong from a trip to Malaysia, other sources said the Thomson situation topped the agenda.</p>
<p>The purchase of Thomson would have made Daewoo Electronics a major world player in electronics, transforming it from a relative unknown into the world's biggest maker of televisions with established brand names and cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to become much more of a Korea-France thing than just between Thomson and Daewoo,&quot; said Bruce Gonyea, regional electronics analyst for Paribas Capital Markets in Singapore and a former Daewoo employee.</p>
<p>&quot;Korean companies have power projects and construction projects in France, and the Korean government is in a good bargaining position,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In 1995, France and South Korea enjoyed bilateral trade worth $3.42 billion, up from $2.8 billion the previous year, French Trade Commission figures show.</p>
<p>The hiccup in Daewoo's plans could bode ill for French businesses in South Korea, industry sources said. &quot;I'm afraid there may be some bad impact,&quot; said Jean-Jacque Grauhar, director of the European Union Chamber of Commerce. &quot;Some politicians are using very hard words toward France.&quot;</p>
