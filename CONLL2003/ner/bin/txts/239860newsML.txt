Mudslide near Japan Olympic ski site, 14 missing.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Fourteen construction workers were missing and eight injured following a mudslide on Friday at a mountain village in central Japan near a 1998 Winter Olympics ski slope, police said.

The mudslide at Otari village in Nagano prefecture, 230 km (138 miles) northwest of Tokyo, washed away a bridge and blocked access to a hamlet of about 30 people, police said.

Television broadcasts showed a dumptruck, crane and several cars tumbling down a fast-moving stream, which surged after rains melted snow that had accumulated last week.

The missing workers, including three women, were among a crew of about 50 who were restoring an embankment that had been damaged in a 1995 landslide, police said.

Police helicopters were being used to search for survivors.

Of 20 workers caught in the landslide, six were rescued. One was seriously injured while six were hurt, police said.

The accident occurred in a ski resort and hot spring spa area, a region of rugged mountains prone to landslides.

Otari is 10 km (six miles) from one of the main ski slopes to be used in the 1998 Winter Olympics at Nagano.

The landslide closed a road linking the area with Japan's western coast, the second time in 14 months that the route was cut off.

The highway restoration project was not connected with preparations for the Winter Games, police said.
