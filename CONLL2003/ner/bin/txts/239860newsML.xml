<p>Fourteen construction workers were missing and eight injured following a mudslide on Friday at a mountain village in central Japan near a 1998 Winter Olympics ski slope, police said.</p>
<p>The mudslide at Otari village in Nagano prefecture, 230 km (138 miles) northwest of Tokyo, washed away a bridge and blocked access to a hamlet of about 30 people, police said.</p>
<p>Television broadcasts showed a dumptruck, crane and several cars tumbling down a fast-moving stream, which surged after rains melted snow that had accumulated last week.</p>
<p>The missing workers, including three women, were among a crew of about 50 who were restoring an embankment that had been damaged in a 1995 landslide, police said.</p>
<p>Police helicopters were being used to search for survivors.</p>
<p>Of 20 workers caught in the landslide, six were rescued. One was seriously injured while six were hurt, police said.</p>
<p>The accident occurred in a ski resort and hot spring spa area, a region of rugged mountains prone to landslides.</p>
<p>Otari is 10 km (six miles) from one of the main ski slopes to be used in the 1998 Winter Olympics at Nagano.</p>
<p>The landslide closed a road linking the area with Japan's western coast, the second time in 14 months that the route was cut off.</p>
<p>The highway restoration project was not connected with preparations for the Winter Games, police said.</p>
