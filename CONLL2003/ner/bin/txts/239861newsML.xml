<p>PALM OIL FUTURES - Prices ended little changed, with some late covering recouping some early losses. Ivan Wong's crop report had mixed impact on the market which traded in tight ranges. Feb futures will deal between 1,190 and 1,230 range.</p>
<p>PALM OIL PHYSICAL - Underlying good fundamentals limited the fall. But prices ended slightly lower with interest seen in CPOs.  </p>
<p>Wong's report, released in early afternoon, estimated output in November to fall 14 percent to 764,000 tonnes, and end-November stocks at 965,000 tonnes against 953,241 a month earlier. Exports are projected at 655,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Prices are likely to move in tight ranges with players still waiting for fresh tenders, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;February futures contract is expected to hover around 1,200 ringgit level in the short-term,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;The contract has been trading within a 20-ringgit range in recent weeks and we need some strong market influencing factors to give the market a clear path,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Price movements were again locked in a tight range with third month February futures expecting to deal between 1,190 and 1,230 rinngit range.</p>
<p>At the close, the February futures contract was down one ringgit at 1,193 ($473.79) a tonne after dealing in a 14-ringgit range. Volume was 1,336 lots against 1,609 lots on Thursday.</p>
<p>Wong said in his crop report today that the barely steady tone was due to weakness in prices of major competing oils.</p>
<p>Traders said the market sentiment will continue to remain uncertain and prices may drift narrowly because of year-end factors.  </p>
<p>Among physicals, Dec (south) crude palm oil was offered at 1,210 ringgit after trading at 1,212.50 and 1,207.50. Bids for Dec (south) was 1,205. Dec (central) saw offers at 1,200 and bids at 1,195, and Dec (north) at 1,190 against 1,180.</p>

<p>Among refined products, Dec RBD palm oil was offered at $517.50 a tonne FOB Malaysia, and Jan/Feb/March at $515. Dec was traded at $516 and $517.50.  </p>
