Singapore bounce back after Hong Kong fall.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Singapore shares bounced back from heavy mid-session losses on Friday as dealers shrugged off a near three percent fall in Hong Kong stocks on interest rate jitters. The benchmark 30-share Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) closed down 23.78 points at 2,190.39 on active volume of 206.33 million shares after earlier losing almost 60 points.

"Everything now depends on what happens on Wall Street and in London," said one institutional dealer. "If they follow through, we could see lower numbers on Monday."

Dealers said investors had been panicked earlier by Hong Kong's reaction to overnight comments by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan about an "irrational exuberance" in stock markets.

They were also concerned by his comments on the prospects for U.S. inflation, which seemed to imply interest rates may have to rise.

Greenspan's remarks were understood by some investors to be a warning that the long rally in U.S. shares may have been overdone and a downward correction might be on its way.

Many dealers had been predicting a fall towards 2,150 points on the STII, but they said the speed of the decline had taken them by surprise.

"When the U.S. sneezes, we all catch a cold," said one local dealer. "Singapore was following Hong Kong."

Almost all Singapore's large capitalisation STII stocks fell, led by drinks firm Fraser & Neave, which lost 40 cents to close at Singapore $15.10.

One of the few stable blue chips was Singapore Airlines foreign, which was flat at S$13.10 after Morgan Stanley recommended it as a core holding. The group gave SIA foreign a 12-month target of S$15.50.
