<p>Singapore shares bounced back from heavy mid-session losses on Friday as dealers shrugged off a near three percent fall in Hong Kong stocks on interest rate jitters. The benchmark 30-share Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) closed down 23.78 points at 2,190.39 on active volume of 206.33 million shares after earlier losing almost 60 points.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything now depends on what happens on Wall Street and in London,&quot; said one institutional dealer. &quot;If they follow through, we could see lower numbers on Monday.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said investors had been panicked earlier by Hong Kong's reaction to overnight comments by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan about an &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in stock markets.</p>
<p>They were also concerned by his comments on the prospects for U.S. inflation, which seemed to imply interest rates may have to rise.</p>
<p>Greenspan's remarks were understood by some investors to be a warning that the long rally in U.S. shares may have been overdone and a downward correction might be on its way.</p>
<p>Many dealers had been predicting a fall towards 2,150 points on the STII, but they said the speed of the decline had taken them by surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;When the U.S. sneezes, we all catch a cold,&quot; said one local dealer. &quot;Singapore was following Hong Kong.&quot;</p>
<p>Almost all Singapore's large capitalisation STII stocks fell, led by drinks firm Fraser &amp; Neave, which lost 40 cents to close at Singapore $15.10.</p>
<p>One of the few stable blue chips was Singapore Airlines foreign, which was flat at S$13.10 after Morgan Stanley recommended it as a core holding. The group gave SIA foreign a 12-month target of S$15.50.</p>
