<p>The regional manager for Air France Cargo, Philippe Bour said he will meet Hong Kong government officials on Monday to explain why some leading airlines are refusing to withdraw a fuel surcharge on ex-HK air cargo.</p>
<p>The imposition by airlines of an 80 Hong Kong cents a kilo fuel surcharge has caused controversy in the territory. Following complaints from the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, which also represents freight forwarders, the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) wrote warning letters asking airlines to withdraw the surcharge. Some did but Bour said Air France, Lufthansa Cargo, Swissair, Air Hong Kong and Thai Airways International have refused.</p>
<p>He told Reuters, &quot; we are fighting with the CAD because they are saying it is totally illegal, but we don't have the same point of view. I am saying it is not a rate increase but a fuel surcharge, which is something totally different. I understand perfectly well that we are not allowed to increase the official rate without referring to the CAD, but when are talking about market rate plus a fuel surcharge we are still far below the official rate. We can play around with the market rates and the fuel surcharge will remain,&quot; Bour explained.</p>
<p>The average rate from Hong Kong to Europe is between HK$23-24 per kilo with a fuel surcharge of 80 HK cents or 10 US cents which restores the rate to last year's level, Bour said. He said the fuel surcharge is not a blanket application, express cargo and cargo with airway bills containing the published rate is exempt.</p>
<p>Bour said the argument had been referred to the French civil aviation department, which has been in touch with the Hong Kong government.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully the meeting on Monday will clarify things and will be a fruitful one,&quot; Bour added. - Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+544 171 542 5017</p>
