China orders courts to get tough, speed up trials.

BEIJING 1996-12-06

China's Supreme People's Court ordered courts nationwide to get tougher on violent crime and to speed up cases, marking Beijing's latest volley in its war on crime, the official Xinhua news agency said on Friday.

"We will allow the criminals no breathing spell," Xinhua quoted supreme court vice-president Liu Jiachen as saying.

"We should not be soft on those who deserve capital punishment," he said.

Liu's call appeared to signal the judicial role in a "Winter Action" announced by police for December to follow up on the Strike Hard campaign that gripped China for much of this year.

Beijing launched the Strike Hard offensive on crime last April, arresting more than 166,000 people in just two months and executing well over 1,000 and possibly thousands, with the courts processing cases at high speed.

"Pressure must be kept up," Liu said in his call to the courts to deal with violent crimes strictly and rapidly.

"People involved in murder, robbery, explosions, kidnapping, abducting women and children, rape, drug smuggling and gang activities must be targeted first," Liu said.

However, Liu warned judges not to let proper legal procedures slip to ensure their decisions could stand up to legal re-examination.

Chinese criminal proceedings are usually swift, and can even take just days from arrest to sentencing. Appeals rarely result in a case being overturned and those sentenced to death are usually executed the same day.

State media on Friday issued a call by Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress, or parliament, to intensify supervision of the executive and judicial branches of government in a sign of the seriousness of the problem.

Official media frequently carry reports of abuse of power by local officials, who run their areas of jurisdiction as virtual fiefdoms, and the word of an official is often taken as law.
