China capital eases rules for travel abroad.

BEIJING 1996-12-06

Beijing police made it easier on Friday for residents of the Chinese capital to travel abroad, simplifying the unwieldy procedures to obtain a passport for a private trip abroad.

The new regulations, issued by the municipal Public Security Bureau took effect from Friday, the official Xinhua news agency quoted a police official as saying.

Under the new rules, Beijing residents applying for passports for private reasons or to study abroad at their own expense no longer need to provide financial guarantees, the official said.

Chinese residents could also now extend the validity of their five-year passports for 10 more years, he said.

Applying for a passport in China is a lengthy and complicated process that can take many months, with police requiring applicants to comply with numerous difficult procedures.
