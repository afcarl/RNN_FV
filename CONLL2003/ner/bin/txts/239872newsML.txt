Mongolia has sacked its intelligence chief after a parliamentary probe uncovered evidence of illegal spying on the political opposition, officials said on Friday.

The Great Hural, or parliament, on Thursday dismissed General J. Baatar as head of the Centre for Espionage and ordered a top-to-bottom reshuffle of the agency, known in Mongolian as the TTG, Hural spokesman T. Nergui told Reuters.

A parliamentary committee said last week it had found evidence that the TTG had bugged telephones of the ex-communist Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) -- which was unseated in elections in June -- and conducted other illegal surveillance activities.

Those abuses were only part of a larger pattern of illegal activities by the TTG begun well before the change in government, R. Odonbaatar, a member of parliament with the ruling Democratic Union Coalition, told a news conference.

About 140 officials would be sacked from the spy agency, which would be renamed the Centre for State Security, centre spokesman C. Boldbaatar said.

"The result of this investigation must be that nobody is allowed to conduct illegal activities in Mongolia," Boldbaatar told Reuters in an interview.

Parliament has appointed deputy procurator J. Enkhnasan as the new chief of intelligence, officials said.

The downfall of the head of the TTG comes just months after General Baatar was named as Mongolia's top spymaster.

The Great Hural was considering placing the centre under the direct supervision of parliament, Boldbaatar said. It is now answerable only to the prime minister.

"There would be a parliamentary committee in charge of intelligence. This is to keep this organisation under the control of the people," Boldbaatar said, adding that the head of the centre would always be a civilian in future.

Prime Minister M. Enkhsaikhan has said the agency is larger than all government ministries combined but officials at the centre declined to comment on its size, saying the information was a state secret.

The Centre for Espionage previously denied MPRP allegations that it spied on the former communists though it had admitted it had spied on reporters under MPRP governments in the past.
