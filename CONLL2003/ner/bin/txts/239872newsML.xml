<p>Mongolia has sacked its intelligence chief after a parliamentary probe uncovered evidence of illegal spying on the political opposition, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The Great Hural, or parliament, on Thursday dismissed General J. Baatar as head of the Centre for Espionage and ordered a top-to-bottom reshuffle of the agency, known in Mongolian as the TTG, Hural spokesman T. Nergui told Reuters.</p>
<p>A parliamentary committee said last week it had found evidence that the TTG had bugged telephones of the ex-communist Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) -- which was unseated in elections in June -- and conducted other illegal surveillance activities.</p>
<p>Those abuses were only part of a larger pattern of illegal activities by the TTG begun well before the change in government, R. Odonbaatar, a member of parliament with the ruling Democratic Union Coalition, told a news conference.</p>
<p>About 140 officials would be sacked from the spy agency, which would be renamed the Centre for State Security, centre spokesman C. Boldbaatar said.</p>
<p>&quot;The result of this investigation must be that nobody is allowed to conduct illegal activities in Mongolia,&quot; Boldbaatar told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Parliament has appointed deputy procurator J. Enkhnasan as the new chief of intelligence, officials said.</p>
<p>The downfall of the head of the TTG comes just months after General Baatar was named as Mongolia's top spymaster.</p>
<p>The Great Hural was considering placing the centre under the direct supervision of parliament, Boldbaatar said. It is now answerable only to the prime minister.</p>
<p>&quot;There would be a parliamentary committee in charge of intelligence. This is to keep this organisation under the control of the people,&quot; Boldbaatar said, adding that the head of the centre would always be a civilian in future.</p>
<p>Prime Minister M. Enkhsaikhan has said the agency is larger than all government ministries combined but officials at the centre declined to comment on its size, saying the information was a state secret.</p>
<p>The Centre for Espionage previously denied MPRP allegations that it spied on the former communists though it had admitted it had spied on reporters under MPRP governments in the past.</p>
