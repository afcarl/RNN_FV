<headline>Hong Kong's SFC issues revised draft of bill.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Hong Kong securities and futures watchdog on Friday issued a revised draft of its omnibus securities and futures bill that updates and unifies laws governing trading in the territory, the chairman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are rationalising and enacting existing legislation into a single ordinance,&quot; said Anthony Neoh, chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission.</p>
<p>The draft Composite Securities and Futures Bill consolidates and updates eight existing laws under one cover, unifying terminology and taking into account changes that have occurred in securities and futures markets in Hong Kong in the past 20 years, Neoh said.</p>
<p>The draft issued on Friday is the product of a consultation period held between the commission and members of the financial industry from April to mid-November of this year.</p>
<p>A second period of consultation will be held in which the public will have one month to submit additional views and proposals.</p>
<p>The commission aims to submit the bill to the legislation process at the end of January 1997.</p>
<p>Following the first consultation period, the commission has made 19 major modifications to its original proposals in response to submissions made by the public.</p>
<p>In response to the those submissions, the commission now will not seek to empower the SFC in particular circumstances to suspend or revoke licenses with immediate effect, Neoh said.</p>
<p>The SFC's action in such cases will not take effect until the end of the appeal process, as stated in the original law.</p>
<p>Banking institutions will continue to be exempt from the licensing regime of the SFC, despite recommendations to the contrary put forth by other government agencies in previous reviews of these laws, Neoh said.</p>
<p>Banks' activities will continue to be supervised by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, despite the fact that many banks have extended securities transactions, he said.</p>
<p>The commission will also agree to the proposal that audited accounts of publicly listed companies be lodged with the SFC within four months of the financial year-end, instead of three months as originally proposed.</p>
<p>Neoh said there were several areas in which the commission was still conducting research and that were not covered in the composite bill.</p>
<p>One of those was the issue of grey market trading, he said.</p>
<p>The commission has been asked to clarify whether the practice of trading in shares of a new listing candidate before official trading on the exchange begins is unlawful.</p>
<p>The commission said in a paper on the bill that there is no specific criminal offence of grey market trading, but it is covered to some extent under sections of the Securities Ordinance and certain stock exchange rules.</p>
<p>It may be unlawful in circumstances involving option and forward trading and short selling.</p>
<p>This issue will be followed up outside the context of the current bill, the chairman said.</p>
