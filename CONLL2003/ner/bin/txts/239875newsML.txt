A landslide in southern China killed at least 23 people earlier this week when a road under construction gave way, officials and state media said on Friday.

The disaster occured on Monday in Guiyang, capital of the southwestern province of Guizhou, a city government official said by telephone.

"Workers were widening the road at the time of the accident," the official said.

Some of those buried in the landslide were workers while other victims were travellers using the road before it had been officially opened, the official said.

Another official with the provincial government contacted by telephone said the wall of rocks and earth had also buried a vegetable market packed with people.

"It buried a vegetable market below the hill. There were a lot of people in the market at the time," the official said.

The official Xinhua news agency said 15 people had been found alive, but it was not known how many were still buried.

The cause of the accident was under investigation, Xinhua said. It gave no reason for the delay in reporting the accident.
