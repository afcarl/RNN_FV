<p>A landslide in southern China killed at least 23 people earlier this week when a road under construction gave way, officials and state media said on Friday.</p>
<p>The disaster occured on Monday in Guiyang, capital of the southwestern province of Guizhou, a city government official said by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;Workers were widening the road at the time of the accident,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Some of those buried in the landslide were workers while other victims were travellers using the road before it had been officially opened, the official said.</p>
<p>Another official with the provincial government contacted by telephone said the wall of rocks and earth had also buried a vegetable market packed with people.</p>
<p>&quot;It buried a vegetable market below the hill. There were a lot of people in the market at the time,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>The official Xinhua news agency said 15 people had been found alive, but it was not known how many were still buried.</p>
<p>The cause of the accident was under investigation, Xinhua said. It gave no reason for the delay in reporting the accident.</p>
