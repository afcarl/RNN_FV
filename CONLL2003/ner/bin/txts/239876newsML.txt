Japan, US still have big gap on insurance - USTR.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said on Friday that wide differences still remain between Japan and the United States over the bilateral dispute on deregulation of Tokyo's insurance market.

Emerging from the first meeting with Japan's Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka in their last-ditch efforts to resolve the issue before a December 15 deadline, Barshefsky told reporters that the meeting was "constructive."

"There are certainly wide differences between us," she said.  

Barshefsky and Mitsuzuka are scheduled to meet again on Saturday to discuss the issue.

Asked if they can reach an agreement during the latest round of talks, Mitsuzuka said, "It's very difficult do do so."

The dispute has become a major irritant between the two countries, and could escalate into a damaging trade fight with threats of sanctions that has marked U.S.-Japan relations in the past, if the dispute is not settled by the deadline.

Barshefsky said senior officials of the USTR and the Finance Ministry will continue to work toward an agreement before her next meeting with Mitsuzuka on Saturday.  

"We deepened our understandings about each other's position. But we could not agree on any points today," Mitsuzuka said.

"We shall see whether further progress can be made. But there are very, very difficult issues," Barshefsky said.

The fight centers on U.S. charges that Japan is planning to renege on a 1994 trade agreement on the deregulation of its $400 billion insurance market.

Both sides have said the talks on Monday and Tuesday would be the last meetings between Mitsuzuka and Barshefsky before the December 15 deadline.  

Japan allowed subsidiaries of domestic life and non-life insurers to start operations in each other's turfs on October 1, but barred them from selling some products in the third sector market -- stand-alone cancer, hospitalisation, nursing care and personal accident insurance -- before January 1.

Washington has argued that the 1994 agreement calls for Tokyo to deregulate the huge primary life and casualty insurance sector, which is dominated by Japanese companies, before unleasing competition in the tiny specialty insurance marekt.
