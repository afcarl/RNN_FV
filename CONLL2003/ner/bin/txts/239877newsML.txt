Vietnam says international bond issue on hold.

HANOI 1996-12-06

Vietnam's central State Bank Governor Cao Si Kiem said on Friday that current conditions were unfavourable for the communist country to test its world credit rating with an international bond issue.

Kiem, speaking at an informal reception, said Hanoi was seeking to concentrate its efforts instead on disbursing aid from the international donor community and in mobilising domestic savings.

In August, banking sources said Vietnam might launch a debut international bond as early as fourth quarter 1996 for $100 to $150 million. The issue was not expected to be rated by major agencies.  

"It's not a matter of months," Kiem said.

"World interest rates are still high and they rate Vietnam as a country of high risk. If we issue bonds to international market at this moment, I think the rate will be very high and conditions unfavourable," he said.

Vietnam has mulled the idea of an international bond issue for several years, however officials have backpedalled in recent months on earlier suggestions the move might be imminent.

International donors, who on Friday pledged to give Vietnam some $2.4 billion in aid during 1997 have also cautioned against Hanoi acquiring further debt.

They say Vietnam should look to other sources of financing before testing its international credit rating.
