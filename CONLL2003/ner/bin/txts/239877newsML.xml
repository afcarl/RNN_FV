<headline>Vietnam says international bond issue on hold.</headline>

<p>Vietnam's central State Bank Governor Cao Si Kiem said on Friday that current conditions were unfavourable for the communist country to test its world credit rating with an international bond issue.</p>
<p>Kiem, speaking at an informal reception, said Hanoi was seeking to concentrate its efforts instead on disbursing aid from the international donor community and in mobilising domestic savings.</p>
<p>In August, banking sources said Vietnam might launch a debut international bond as early as fourth quarter 1996 for $100 to $150 million. The issue was not expected to be rated by major agencies.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's not a matter of months,&quot; Kiem said.</p>
<p>&quot;World interest rates are still high and they rate Vietnam as a country of high risk. If we issue bonds to international market at this moment, I think the rate will be very high and conditions unfavourable,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Vietnam has mulled the idea of an international bond issue for several years, however officials have backpedalled in recent months on earlier suggestions the move might be imminent.</p>
<p>International donors, who on Friday pledged to give Vietnam some $2.4 billion in aid during 1997 have also cautioned against Hanoi acquiring further debt.</p>
<p>They say Vietnam should look to other sources of financing before testing its international credit rating.</p>
