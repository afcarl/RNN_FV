Multi-Purpose aborts buy of unit shares.

KUALA LUMPUR 1996-12-06

Multi-Purpose Holdings Bhd said on Friday it was aborting its mandatory takeover offer for the remaining shares in financial subsidiary Multi-Purpose Capital Holdings Bhd.

The Securities Commission had not approved the offer proposed by Multi-Purpose in September, the company said in a statement to the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.

Multi-Purpose holds a 76.36 percent stake in Multi-Purpose Capital, which is involved in commercial banking, general insurance and assorted financial services.

Multi-Purpose had proposed the mandatory takeover at 2.60 ringgit a share to give shareholders of Multi-Purpose Capital what it described an opportunity to divest their unlisted shareholding and realise a capital gain on their investment.
