Cabinet-level U.S. official to visit Taiwan.

TAIPEI 1996-12-06

Washington is to send a cabinet member to Taiwan for business talks, although analysts said the official's relatively junior status signalled a snub reflecting warming U.S. ties with China.

Philip Lader, head of the U.S. Small Business Administration, would arrive in Taipei on December 9 for a joint business conference, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said on Friday.

Despite the presence of U.S. and Taiwan officials, the forum is deemed unofficial because Washington has diplomatic ties only with Beijing, not Taipei.

Lader is scheduled to address the conference and visit Taiwan officials, the ministry said in a statement.

"The ministry welcomes the U.S. act of sending a leading cadre-level official to attend the joint business conference," the statement said.

Analysts say that as tensions between the United States and China ease, Washington may begin to limit high-level exchanges with Taiwan, China's diplomatic rival since a civil war split them in 1949. Washington switched ties to Beijing in 1979.

"It's clear that the United States does not want to ruin the good atmosphere with China at this moment," said Chiou Chao-lin of Taiwan's Academia Sinica, noting that Lader was more junior than Taiwan officials had expected.

"There should be fewer high-level U.S. officials to visit Taiwan in the near term," said Chiou, a specialist on relations between Taiwan, China and the United States.

Presidents Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin agreed in November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to hold summits in Washington in 1997 and Beijing in 1998.

Sino-U.S. ties began cooling after Washington allowed Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to make a private U.S. visit in mid-1995, and reached bottom after China mounted missile tests and war games in waters off Taiwan in the runup to the island's March presidential election.

Washington sent two aircraft carrier groups to the region in a dramatic reproach to what Beijing acknowledged was a bid to intimidate Taiwan voters away from hopes for the island's independence from China.

Both governments advocate reunification but refuse even to discuss what terms might be acceptable.

The most recent senior U.S. exchange was a September visit by Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who was the highest ranking U.S. official to visit since U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena in December 1994.
