<title>TAIWAN: Cabinet-level U.S. official to visit Taiwan.</title>

<p>Washington is to send a cabinet member to Taiwan for business talks, although analysts said the official's relatively junior status signalled a snub reflecting warming U.S. ties with China.</p>
<p>Philip Lader, head of the U.S. Small Business Administration, would arrive in Taipei on December 9 for a joint business conference, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>Despite the presence of U.S. and Taiwan officials, the forum is deemed unofficial because Washington has diplomatic ties only with Beijing, not Taipei.</p>
<p>Lader is scheduled to address the conference and visit Taiwan officials, the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The ministry welcomes the U.S. act of sending a leading cadre-level official to attend the joint business conference,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Analysts say that as tensions between the United States and China ease, Washington may begin to limit high-level exchanges with Taiwan, China's diplomatic rival since a civil war split them in 1949. Washington switched ties to Beijing in 1979.</p>
<p>&quot;It's clear that the United States does not want to ruin the good atmosphere with China at this moment,&quot; said Chiou Chao-lin of Taiwan's Academia Sinica, noting that Lader was more junior than Taiwan officials had expected.</p>
<p>&quot;There should be fewer high-level U.S. officials to visit Taiwan in the near term,&quot; said Chiou, a specialist on relations between Taiwan, China and the United States.</p>
<p>Presidents Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin agreed in November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to hold summits in Washington in 1997 and Beijing in 1998.</p>
<p>Sino-U.S. ties began cooling after Washington allowed Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to make a private U.S. visit in mid-1995, and reached bottom after China mounted missile tests and war games in waters off Taiwan in the runup to the island's March presidential election.</p>
<p>Washington sent two aircraft carrier groups to the region in a dramatic reproach to what Beijing acknowledged was a bid to intimidate Taiwan voters away from hopes for the island's independence from China.</p>
<p>Both governments advocate reunification but refuse even to discuss what terms might be acceptable.</p>
<p>The most recent senior U.S. exchange was a September visit by Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who was the highest ranking U.S. official to visit since U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena in December 1994.</p>
