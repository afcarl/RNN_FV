SFC seeks HK$10mn penalty for market manipulation.

HONG KONG 1996-12-06

Hong Kong's securities and futures watchdog is seeking a significant increase in the levels of penalties for market manipulation and other deceptive trading practices, the chairman said on Friday.

"We are seeking a maximum penalty of HK$10 million and 14 years imprisonment," Anthony Neoh, Securities and Futures Commission chairman.

The present law carries a maximum penalty of HK$50,000 and six months in prison.

Neoh said the proposed level of penalty was in line with that found in other legislation in the territory and would be applied in serious cases, that is on conviction on indictment of cases tried at district court and high court level.

For less serious offences, i.e. summary conviction, the commission is seeking a maximum fine of HK$1.0 million and three years imprisonment.

"We are also seeking to increase the commission's own fining powers up to a maximum of HK$500,000," Neoh said.

The commission had originally only sought a maximum of HK$50,000.

"The reason for this change of mind was the Jardine Fleming case, where the securities and futures authority in the U.K. fined the parent body Jardine Fleming Asset Management a total of 700,000 stg, that is slightly larger than HK$7 million," said Neoh.

Jardine Fleming was fined by London's Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO) after a five-month investigation by the London body and Hong Kong's SFC exposed a pattern of late allocation of trades by Jardine fund manager Colin Armstrong.

"We are not asking for unlimited fining powers, but a fining power which could be used to make a point. I think in the case like Jardines a fining power of HK$50,000 would be insufficient," said Neoh.

The commission, however, is stepping back from another proposal which seeks power for the commission to prescribe offences in rules.

The commission is instead proposing that only the Governor in Council can make subsidiary legislation creating criminal offences and stipulating criminal sanctions.
