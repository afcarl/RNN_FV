China sees falling grain prices in 1997.

BEIJING 1996-12-06

Grain prices in China are expected to drop further in 1997 and industry experts say marketing problems could hit the autumn harvest next year, the China Economic Times said on Friday.

Grain supply was seen exceeding demand in 1997 and planting and weather conditions indicated a good summer crop next year, the newspaper quoted officials from the Ministry of Agriculture as saying.

The time was ripe for China to reform its grain marketing system, the newspaper said, adding that difficulties in selling grain would sap planting incentives for farmers.

"If difficulties in selling grain are exacerbated, prices will plummet to a level below farmers' production costs, then it will reduce farmers' enthusiasm for planting and output will drop," the newspaper said.

China's central authorities buy a certain amount of grain from farmers at below market prices to ensure ample stores in state granaries.

The price of corn next year was seen fluctuating around the current level of about 1,350 yuan ($162) a tonne.

Supply of rice and wheat would continue to be tight while a shortage of soybeans was predicted, it said.

"The adjustment of the grain product structure will be a major aspect of grain work in 1997," it said.

Plantings of cotton and oil-producing crops were seen falling in 1997 but supply and demand would be basically even, it said.

International grain prices were now too low for China to export but an expected market rebound in the second half of 1997 could boost sales of grain abroad, it said.
