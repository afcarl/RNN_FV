Many Chinese companies evade taxes - newspaper.

BEIJING 1996-12-06

Up to 60 percent of state-run or collective firms in China evade taxes, the China Market Economic News said in an edition seen in Beijing on Friday.

More than 80 percent of private companies and small, individually-run enterprises do the same, the newspaper said.

Tax evasion among foreign-invested and wholly foreign-owned firms was "astonishing", it said, but gave no figures.

China collected 510.0 billion yuan ($61.4 billion) in industrial and commercial taxes in January-October, an increase of 20.3 percent from the same period last year, it said.

That sum fulfilled 84.6 percent of the state target for the year, said the December 4 edition of the newspaper.

Consumption and value-added taxes accounted for 286.2 billion yuan of the total, up 16.8 percent year on year, and meeting 78.3 percent of the national target, it said.
