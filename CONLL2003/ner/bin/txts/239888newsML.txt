Malaysia Ban Hin Lee denies merger talk.

KUALA LUMPUR 1996-12-06

Malaysia's Ban Hin Lee Bank Bhd on Friday denied it was aware of any plan to merge with another domestic bank.

The bank was replying to a query from the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange on a report in The Star newspaper on Thursday.

Quoting industry sources, The Star said Ban Hin Lee might merge with Hong Leong Bank Bhd.

But Ban Hin Lee said in its statement that it was "not aware of any such plan for merger".

According to stockmarket speculation, property company Advance Synergy Bhd (ASB) may be seeking to buy a stake in Ban Hin Lee, and later sell or merge it with Hong Leong Bank.

Around five percent of ASB equity is owned by the Hong Leong group, seen as a possible initiator of any merger plan, analysts and dealers said.

Officials at ASB, Ban Hin Lee and Hong Leong were earlier on Friday not available to comment on the speculation.

The rumours started after shares of ASB surged in heavy trading this week.

In line with the regional rout of stocks, ASB stock on Friday ended down 18 cents to 4.46 ringgit, after earlier hitting a year high of 4.76. It was the most actively traded stock, notching volume of 7.33 million.

Ban Hin Lee fell 70 cents to 10.80 and Hong Leong Bank was down 25 to 8.70.
