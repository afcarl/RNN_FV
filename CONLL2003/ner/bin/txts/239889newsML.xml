<p>Indonesia would like Moslem nations to focus on economic cooperation and development during next week's meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Friday.</p>
<p>Indonesia is playing host for the first time to the five-day OIC foreign ministers' meeting opening on Monday in Jakarta.</p>
<p>&quot;The OIC ought to spend more time and focus...on economic cooperation among member states to enhance the economic welfare of its members,&quot; Alatas told a news conference.</p>
<p>But he said this did not mean important political issues -- some long-standing, some new -- should be ignored.</p>
<p>Such issues include the Middle East peace process, Bosnia and Afghanistan, which will not be represented at the 53-nation gathering.</p>
<p>Alatas said senior officials meeting at IOC headquarters in Jeddah last month decided not to invite a delegation from Kabul because no one could agree on who should represent Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The hardline Islamic group Taleban seized Kabul on September 27. Forces loyal to President Burhanuddin Rabbani and ethnic Uzbek leader Rashid Dostum are trying to win the city back.</p>
<p>&quot;The ministerial conference will try to find a way out of this problem,&quot; Alatas said.</p>
<p>The minister said another issue the conference would address was how to fight Western views that equated Islam with violence and terrorism.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying to develop a cultural information programme to combat this,&quot; Alatas said.</p>
<p>The conference will also have to find a successor to OIC Secretary-General Hamid Algabid, whose term expires at the end of the year, and decide on the venue for the OIC summit in 1997.</p>
