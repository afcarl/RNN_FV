SIMEX JGBs plunge on rumours, rate hike fears.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-05

Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's anti-inflationary comments sent shockwaves on Friday through the short-end of the Japanese yield curve, with Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) leading the fall, dealers said.

In a speech to the American Enterprise Institute on Thursday, Greenspan said the Fed had to be wary of "irrational exuberance" infecting the U.S. stock and other asset markets.

The anti-inflationary comment re-ignited fears of rate hikes by the Fed, triggering a nose-dive in JGBs.

March JGBs fell 91 ticks to end at 125.42 on a turnover of 1,285 lots.  

Dealers said JGBs were rifed with rumours, including selling by Japan's central bank and cut in buying by Japan's Ministry of Finance. They said although the rumours were later denied by the Bank of Japan, JGBs failed to recover.

Euroyen held fairly steady amid the nervousness caused by Greenspan's speech. September Euroyen was at 99.17 in late Friday trade against its previous IMM close at 99.18. June was at 99.31, also down a tick from its IMM close. Total turnover for the two contracts were about 26,155 lots.

Dealers said the stability in Euroyen reflected the market's concern over Japanese domestic affairs to international matters.  

It also reflected market's confidence that the Bank of Japan would maintain its steady rate policy.

After trading in a volatile 13-tick band, SIMEX June Eurodollars ended at 94.27 on a hefty turnover of 41,025 lots. Its previous IMM close was at 94.25.

Most dealers awaited the U.S. non-farm payroll for a clearer market direction. Market consensus for the November payrolls is a rise in the region of 180,000 after a 210,000 increase in October. Overall jobless rate was expected to be steady at 5.2 percent of the workforce. The data is due at 1330 GMT.
