<p>Taiwan regulators said on Friday they would wait until exchanges in Chicago and Singapore launch their Taiwan stock-index futures in January before deciding whether to cooperate with -- or seek to block -- the projects.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to await their actual operations to see what's the real impact, and then decide our move,&quot; said Timothy Lin, international affairs chief at Taiwan's watchdog Securities Exchange and Commission.</p>
<p>The commission, which is overseeing development of Taiwan's own futures exchange, has had talks with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) but has struck no cooperative deal with either. Without cooperation, the SIMEX and CME would lack direct access to real-time price movement and index data that would help make their stock index contracts viable.</p>
<p>Lin stopped short of referring to the SIMEX and CME projects as hostile, but indicated that the commission could choose to treat them as such and withdraw support for the proprietary Taiwan stock indexes on which their contracts will be based.</p>
<p>The CME contracts will use the Dow Jones Taiwan Index compiled by Dow Jones and Co Inc, while the SIMEX will use the Taiwan Index of Morgan Stanley Capital International, a unit of Morgan Stanley Group Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;It's one of our options to withdraw the data that the CME and SIMEX need for their Taiwan stock-index futures,&quot; Lin said.</p>
<p>&quot;If their operations block our market orders, we will do so (withdraw data),&quot; Lin said by telephone. &quot;But we will not use (this approach) except with extreme caution.&quot;</p>
<p>A Morgan Stanley spokesman in Hong Kong said his company chose not to comment. Officials of Dow Jones were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The SIMEX and CME, eyeing a gap opened by Taiwan's financial liberalisation but not yet filled by the long-awaited Taiwan futures exchange, have announced plans to launch Taiwan stock-index futures and options in January.</p>
<p>Both will offer trading during Taiwan stock-trading hours, giving them a big head start over Taiwan's own exchange, which is racing to start up by July 1 but must await parliament's passage of a futures exchange law.</p>
<p>Analysts say Taiwan's exchange should have strong advantages with which to woo business back.</p>
<p>Without a cooperative deal with the CME or SIMEX, Taiwan is unlikely to let Taiwanese investors trade the offshore contracts.</p>
<p>Taiwan still bans trading in unauthorised futures contracts, though it would be difficult to police investors seeking to trade through overseas brokerages.</p>
<p>Lin said the securities commisison would continue to talk with the CME and SIMEX, hoping to reach a mutually advantageous plan for simultaneous launch of local and offshore Taiwan stock-index derivatives with equal access by all.</p>
<p>He said the offshore operations by the CME and SIMEX offer advantages and disadvantages for the island's stock market, but would not discuss these in detail.</p>
