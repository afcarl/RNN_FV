China to reorganise its silk industry.

BEIJING 1996-12-06

China will approve no new silk factories next year due to a shortage raw materials. It also aims to raise the efficiency of the industry by selectively renewing production licences of mills, officials said on Friday.

"We want to reduce the (industry's) huge production capacity to keep the market balanced," an official of Silk Corp under the Chinese Association of Textile Industry told Reuters by telephone.

No new silk factories would be approved next year, he said, adding that existing silk mills would be required to renew their production licences from January.

He declined to give specific criteria for renewal or say how many factories would be closed.

"It would be based on the principle of survival of the fittest," he said, indicating that the production licences of profitable factories would be renewed.

Asked if the system of renewing licences would lead to more bankruptcies, the official said: "Many silk mills have already declared bankruptcy because the industry is depressed."

Domestic cocoon supply can meet two-thirds of China's silk reeling capacity and only half its national silk spinning capacity.

China, the world's largest silk producer, exported 70 percent of production in 1995 and its exports of raw silk accounted for roughly 80 percent of the world's total.
