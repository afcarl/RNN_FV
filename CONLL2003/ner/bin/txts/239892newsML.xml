<p>China will approve no new silk factories next year due to a shortage raw materials. It also aims to raise the efficiency of the industry by selectively renewing production licences of mills, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to reduce the (industry's) huge production capacity to keep the market balanced,&quot; an official of Silk Corp under the Chinese Association of Textile Industry told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>No new silk factories would be approved next year, he said, adding that existing silk mills would be required to renew their production licences from January.</p>
<p>He declined to give specific criteria for renewal or say how many factories would be closed.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be based on the principle of survival of the fittest,&quot; he said, indicating that the production licences of profitable factories would be renewed.</p>
<p>Asked if the system of renewing licences would lead to more bankruptcies, the official said: &quot;Many silk mills have already declared bankruptcy because the industry is depressed.&quot;</p>
<p>Domestic cocoon supply can meet two-thirds of China's silk reeling capacity and only half its national silk spinning capacity.</p>
<p>China, the world's largest silk producer, exported 70 percent of production in 1995 and its exports of raw silk accounted for roughly 80 percent of the world's total.</p>
