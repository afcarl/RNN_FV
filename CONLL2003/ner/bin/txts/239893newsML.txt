Singapore gas oil soars to new five-year high.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Singapore physical gas oil traded on Friday at a new post-Gulf War five-year high of $34.45 a barrel, up $1.45 a barrel from the previous traded record achieved on Thursday, traders said.

The 225,000-barrel cargo was sold by a European major to a Swiss trader for lifting on December 23-27 on a free-on-board Singapore basis. Traders said the surge in prices was due to a squeeze on the prompt physical gas oil and a big increase in overnight crude values.

Strong Chinese demand and tight prompt regional availabilites contributed to the price surge, traders said.  

But the hike was mainly on the back of January Brent higher close on Thursday up 85 cents to $24.64 a barrel, while December gas oil ended up 5.50 a tonne at $229.50.

The new record was already anticipated earlier in the day in the wake of soaring swap prices with January actively traded from a low of $32.80 to $33.15 a barrel, from Thursday's $32.05/32.15, brokers said. Late day prices eased to $32.70/$32.85, they said.

The January jet fuel/gas oil spread was steady, traded at $1.83 and $1.70 in spite of gas oil swap's hike, suggesting emerging North Asian physical demand for jet fuel, traders said.  

Naphtha firmed with January swaps 70-80 cents higher at $24.65/$24.90 per barrel. The pressured gasoline/naphtha spread found reprieve with gasoline traded at $26.25 per barrel fob Singapore, for a 95-octane cargo lifting January 1-5, higher than Thursday's trade at $25.40. A Thai 240,000 barrels of 95-octane gasoline cargo was confirmed sold to a state-oil company for export at a 20 cents premium over Singapore quotes fob Sri Racha lifting Jan 5-10.

Fuel oil prices edged up slightly despite the overnight crude surge as players were sidelined over unclear price directions.-- Singapore Newsroom (+65-870 3093)
