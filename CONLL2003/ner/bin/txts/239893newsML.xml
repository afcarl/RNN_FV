<title>SINGAPORE: Singapore gas oil soars to new five-year high.</title>
<headline>Singapore gas oil soars to new five-year high.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Singapore physical gas oil traded on Friday at a new post-Gulf War five-year high of $34.45 a barrel, up $1.45 a barrel from the previous traded record achieved on Thursday, traders said.</p>
<p>The 225,000-barrel cargo was sold by a European major to a Swiss trader for lifting on December 23-27 on a free-on-board Singapore basis. Traders said the surge in prices was due to a squeeze on the prompt physical gas oil and a big increase in overnight crude values.</p>
<p>Strong Chinese demand and tight prompt regional availabilites contributed to the price surge, traders said.  </p>
<p>But the hike was mainly on the back of January Brent higher close on Thursday up 85 cents to $24.64 a barrel, while December gas oil ended up 5.50 a tonne at $229.50.</p>
<p>The new record was already anticipated earlier in the day in the wake of soaring swap prices with January actively traded from a low of $32.80 to $33.15 a barrel, from Thursday's $32.05/32.15, brokers said. Late day prices eased to $32.70/$32.85, they said.</p>
<p>The January jet fuel/gas oil spread was steady, traded at $1.83 and $1.70 in spite of gas oil swap's hike, suggesting emerging North Asian physical demand for jet fuel, traders said.  </p>
<p>Naphtha firmed with January swaps 70-80 cents higher at $24.65/$24.90 per barrel. The pressured gasoline/naphtha spread found reprieve with gasoline traded at $26.25 per barrel fob Singapore, for a 95-octane cargo lifting January 1-5, higher than Thursday's trade at $25.40. A Thai 240,000 barrels of 95-octane gasoline cargo was confirmed sold to a state-oil company for export at a 20 cents premium over Singapore quotes fob Sri Racha lifting Jan 5-10.</p>
<p>Fuel oil prices edged up slightly despite the overnight crude surge as players were sidelined over unclear price directions.-- Singapore Newsroom (+65-870 3093)</p>
