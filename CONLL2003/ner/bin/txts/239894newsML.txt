Agenda commitment will show WTO progress-Singapore.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Singapore will judge next week's World Trade Organisation (WTO) conference a success if it wins a reaffirmation of commitments to liberalising trade, Singapore Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said on Friday.

"If the ministers in coming to Singapore can reaffirm their commitment to the implementation of the built-in agenda, that gives the WTO a definite work programme that will continue the trade liberalisation effort," Yeo said.

Yeo will chair the December 9-13 WTO conference.

He said there was a sufficient consensus established earlier among WTO's permanent representatives on the substantive aspects of the conference at a recent meeting in Geneva.

"There is consensus to critically review the implementation of the Uruguay Round," Yeo said. He said this was important for the credibility of the multilateral trading system and of the newly established WTO.

There was agreement also on the need to commence further work on the built-in agenda, he said.

"These are provisions in the Uruguay Round Agreements signed by all WTO members for reviews and negotiations on a whole range of issues/sectors within given time frames," Yeo said.

He said the solid implementation of these Uruguay commitments would set the stage for the next round of trade talks, expected around the turn of the century.

Issues still unresolved include an Information Technology Agreement and labour, investment and competition policies, textile issues and openness in government procurement.

Asked about tangible economic and political benefits to Singapore as host of the conference, Yeo looked to the future.

"The holding of the conference here in a way recognises the importance of trade liberalisation...we hope that ministers who come to Singapore see the sorts of benefits that freer trade has given us," Yeo said.

This should persuade them to move closer to Singapore's commitment to free trade, he said.
