<p>Singapore will judge next week's World Trade Organisation (WTO) conference a success if it wins a reaffirmation of commitments to liberalising trade, Singapore Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;If the ministers in coming to Singapore can reaffirm their commitment to the implementation of the built-in agenda, that gives the WTO a definite work programme that will continue the trade liberalisation effort,&quot; Yeo said.</p>
<p>Yeo will chair the December 9-13 WTO conference.</p>
<p>He said there was a sufficient consensus established earlier among WTO's permanent representatives on the substantive aspects of the conference at a recent meeting in Geneva.</p>
<p>&quot;There is consensus to critically review the implementation of the Uruguay Round,&quot; Yeo said. He said this was important for the credibility of the multilateral trading system and of the newly established WTO.</p>
<p>There was agreement also on the need to commence further work on the built-in agenda, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;These are provisions in the Uruguay Round Agreements signed by all WTO members for reviews and negotiations on a whole range of issues/sectors within given time frames,&quot; Yeo said.</p>
<p>He said the solid implementation of these Uruguay commitments would set the stage for the next round of trade talks, expected around the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Issues still unresolved include an Information Technology Agreement and labour, investment and competition policies, textile issues and openness in government procurement.</p>
<p>Asked about tangible economic and political benefits to Singapore as host of the conference, Yeo looked to the future.</p>
<p>&quot;The holding of the conference here in a way recognises the importance of trade liberalisation...we hope that ministers who come to Singapore see the sorts of benefits that freer trade has given us,&quot; Yeo said.</p>
<p>This should persuade them to move closer to Singapore's commitment to free trade, he said.</p>
