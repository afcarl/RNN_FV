Foreign securities firms appeal to MOF on tax plan.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Four major foreign securities firms have submitted a petition to Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) appealing against planned rule changes on foreign bond investment.

The ministry should conduct a thorough study before finalising the plan, they said in the statement, a copy of which was acquired by Reuters.

The firms, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and SBC Warburg, suggested that MOF work with them to come up with a plan that could be widely accepted by market participants.  

It said the MOF's plan could damage the competitiveness of Eurobonds issued by Japanese firms.

The MOF plan, disclosed earlier this week, is aimed at closing a tax loophole in foreign bond investment.

It would require identification of the final holder of Eurobonds issued by Japanese borrowers to show they are foreigners and therefore exempt from tax.

A MOF study showed that about 80 percent of Euroyen bonds are held by Japanese investors.

The statement said the MOF's aim to require identification of final investors would not be easy to achieve. "We wish the Japanese eurobond market to develop and we hope that the ministry will examine our opinions," it said.

MOF has already submitted the plan to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's tax panel.

Industry sources said they expect the panel's decision during the week of December 16.
