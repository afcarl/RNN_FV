Malaysia says will not fully open telecom market.

KUALA LUMPUR 1996-12-06

Malaysia said on Friday it was not ready to fully open its telecommunications market to the world even as the United States sought support for a pact to liberalise the industry prior to a trade meeting.

"We are not yet prepared to open our markets over and beyond what we have done before," Malaysia's International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz told reporters ahead of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) meeting next week.

"We believe in the process of progressive liberalisation and this will apply to the whole range of our businesses, including telecommunications and finance," Rafidah said.

Singapore will host the first ministerial meeting of the WTO, successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, from December 9 to 13.

Reed Hundt, chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, said in Jakarta that a closed-door meeting of around 30 nations will be held at the WTO meeting in Singapore on Monday to gauge response to a U.S. plan for a Global Information Initiative (GII) pact.

Rafidah said she was unlikely to attend the meeting mentioned by Hunt as she was scheduled to hold talks with a Singaporean trade delegation around the same time.

The pact aims to drop limits on foreign ownership of telecommunications and enable access to global telecom markets.

It also aims to have independent regulatory agencies in different countries with transparent operations that follow the rule of law and allow networks to interconnect at reasonable prices.

Rafidah said foreign telecommunications companies had already been allowed in a "fairly large" way into Malaysia. "As whenever we can, we will" open up, she said.
