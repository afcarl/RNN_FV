<p>The euphoria enjoyed by Hong Kong stocks over recent months could give way to some short-term caution after a sudden resurgence in interest rate fears shocked share prices into a nosedive on Friday, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index skidded to its biggest point drop since March on Friday, falling 388.83 points, or 2.88 percent, to 13,102.73, after tumbling more than 600 points during the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Within the month the market can continue to be weak on continued interest rate fears,&quot; said Kent Rossiter, institutional sales manager at Nikko Securities.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan sent share prices reeling on Friday after he said the Fed must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stock and other asset markets.</p>
<p>&quot;People are taking that as a sign that he thinks the equity markets are too high,&quot; said Alan Hutcheson, director of research at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Greenspan also said that while U.S. inflation had been low recently, its future course was uncertain and the Fed had to be forward-looking in setting policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously there are renewed concerns about interest rate movements,&quot; said Edward Chan, research director at NAVA SC Securities. &quot;Unless Alan Greenspan makes more comments to clarify his policy, I think this uncertainty will continue.&quot;</p>
<p>Chan said investors were likely to tread cautiously ahead of the Federal Reserve's next policy setting meeting on December 17. &quot;I think the downside can be as much as 500 points if these concerns on interest rates intensify,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts said U.S. employment data, to be released later on Friday, would give investors some guidance. U.S. economists are expecting a rise of 179,000 in non-farm payrolls in November.</p>
<p>&quot;If the payroll number is okay you might see some recovery in the index,&quot; said Hutcheson.</p>
<p>Howard Gorges, director at South China Brokerage, said investors would watch how Wall Street reacts to the data.</p>
<p>&quot;I think people will be watching to see Wall Street's behaviour tonight and then on Monday they will decide whether we have overdone it (the selloff),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If interest rates go up I don't think it is the end of the world for Hong Kong either but I think the market is taking into account the possibility of an interest rate tightening.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hang Seng has been rising steadily since the beginning of September. Despite Friday's decline, the index is up 17.41 percent since the end of August and analysts said Friday's rate concerns were considered a good excuse to take profits.</p>
<p>&quot;Hong Kong has been overvalued for some time,&quot; said Abhijit Chakrabortti, senior strategist at Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>&quot;The market really clearly needs to go some more way before it is restored to fair value... From where the market started today, we would like to have seen a 1,000 to 1,500 points pullback,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Alex Tang, head of research at Yamaichi International, expected some consolidation in the short term.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still expecting a year-end rally but right now I think the market will probably continue to consolidate over the next week or so and then it will resume its uptrend,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Alex Wong, technical analyst at Dharmala Securities, said the Hang Seng could drop another 200 to 300 points but should find solid support at 12,700 to 12,800.</p>
<p>&quot;I think one should wait for a further decline to buy again but overall the market is still okay,&quot; he said. &quot;It may see a further correction of 200 to 300 points but on the downside one can still buy for long-term investment.&quot;</p>
