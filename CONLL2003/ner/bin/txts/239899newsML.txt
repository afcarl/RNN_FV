A property consortium involved in the Mass Transit Railway Corp development at Hong Kong's Tai Kok Tsui Station Package Two site is seeking a HK$8 billion loan facility, bankers said.

The borrower is Benefit Bright Ltd, a vehicle of the consortium, which comprises Sino Land Co Ltd, Kerry Properties, China Overseas Land and Investment and the Bank of China Group.

HSBC Investment Bank Asia, China Development Finance Co, Hang Seng Bank, WestLB, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale and BA Asia are arranging the deal, bankers said.

The facility has a final maturity of four years with no put or call options.

It pays a margin of 140 basis points over the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate and an all-in return of between 150 and 160 basis points over HIBOR for sub-underwriters.

Proceeds are to be used for financing the property development of Tai Kok Tsui MTR Sation Package Two, which is one of the many projects associated with Hong Kong's new airport.
