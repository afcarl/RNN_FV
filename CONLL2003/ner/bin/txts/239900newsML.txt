Global competitors have little to fear in NTT.

The Japanese government's half-hearted move to restructure Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) is good news for its global competitors, industry analysts said on Friday.

Under a two-year "break-up" plan the company will actually stay together, with a holding company supervising the operations of three major units -- two regional companies and a long-distance carrier.

The restructuring of what is the world's largest phone company has been debated for more than a decade, with NTT managers fighting to keep the corporate colossus as a single entity.

Yoshio Suzuki, a former member of a government deregulation committee, said the plan would jeopardise the development of Japan's telecommunications market to the benefit of foreign firms.

"The new scheme means NTT remains one big company," he said. "We can't expect things like rate-cut competition and reasonable services. It is welcome news for BT and AT&T and the world's big carriers," he said.

The inefficiency of NTT, which dominates the domestic phone market, should give international rivals a strong competitive advantage at a time when they are expanding aggressively, he said.

Another telecommunications expert called the plan a major victory for NTT.

"Mega-mergers certainly helped support NTT's argument that it should not be broken into smaller, independent units," he said.

BT -- British Telecommunications Plc said last month that it was merging with U.S. long-distance carrier MCI Communications Corp in a $20 billion deal, the latest global tie-up in the industry.

Masahito Tani, bureau chief at the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, said the NTT long-distance call unit would be allowed to invest in foreign operators and compete globally as a private company.

But he acknowledged that for the time being, foreign operators would not be able to take shares in the Japanese units since all the stock would be held by the holding company.

NTT said the restructuring may take at least two years, probably delaying its entry into the global market and leaving the field open for a while yet to big players already established internationally.

Kiyohisa Ota, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc., said the proposed management structure for NTT was a step towards establishing a fair and competitive telecommunications market in Japan.

"When combined with two other measures, the goal of establishing a fair and competitive market in Japan can be reached to a certain extent," Ota said.

He described these as the establishment of access rules and lifting of foreign ownership restrictions on Japanese telecoms firms.

Japan is expected to offer to lift restrictions on foreign investment in much of its telecommunications sector during a World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting in Singapore later this month.

Ota said NTT would be allowed to move into international business earlier than 1999, reflecting Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's strong intention to back the firm's overseas activities.

Hashimoto told reporters he approved of the NTT reorganisation plan, adding: "Japan should no longer lag behind in the international telecommunications field."
