Thai rubber steady as supply drops, demand thin.

BANGKOK 1996-12-06

Thai rubber prices were steady to slightly higher this week despite thin demand as supplies dropped sharply, trade sources said on Friday.

Heavy rains in the south substantially cut supplies from around the area, they said,

Only about 62,961 kg of sheet rubber entered the market, a 83.5 percent drop from a week earlier, according to auction market sources.

The Thai benchmark RSS3 for January shipment was quoted around $1.23-1.24 a kg FOB Bangkok compared with $1.23 last week.

STR20 for January shipment was quoted around $1.22-$1.23 on the same basis.

Traders said China and Japan entered the market this week but in moderate quantity.

But many expected the prices to move with an upward bias next week.

"The tight supplies and news that Japan rubber stocks at end of November fell should help bouy the prices," said one Hat Yai trader.
