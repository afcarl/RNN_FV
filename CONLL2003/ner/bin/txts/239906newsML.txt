China, Britain approve Hong Kong contracts.

HONG KONG 1996-12-06

China and Britain put the stamp of approval on Friday on several large commercial contracts straddling Hong Kong's mid-1997 handover to Chinese rule, a Chinese official said at the end of three days of negotiations.

The contracts included three franchises related to the new airport, under construction at Chek Lap Kok and due to open in 1998, and they signed agreed minutes to extend a bus franchise on Lantau island, China's team leader Zhao Jihua said.

The airport franchises were for the Tsing Ma control area management, aviation fuel supply and ground support, Zhao told a news conference after the Joint Liaison Group (JLG) talks.

Hong Kong, a British colony of over a century and a half, reverts to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997. All major commercial contracts on infrastructure projects straddling the 1997 handover have to be approved by the JLG.
