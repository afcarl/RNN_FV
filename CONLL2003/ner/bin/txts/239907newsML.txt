Japan Dec long-term prime to be unchanged - traders.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Japan's long-term prime rate is likely to be left unchanged at 2.7 percent in December, bond traders said on Friday.

But it could still be lowered if the Japanese bond market shows a recovery on Monday morning, they added.

A spokesman for the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd (IBJ) said the bank would announce its decision on its long-term prime rate on Monday afternoon.

The prime rate, at which long-term credit banks lend to their most creditworthy customers, was cut by 0.3 percentage point to 2.7 percent in October.

The IBJ customarily sets its long-term prime rate 0.9 percentage point above its debenture coupon rate.

The yield of the IBJ debentures issued in November with a 1.8 percent coupon stood at around 1.625 percent late on Friday, traders said.

If the debenture yield remains at around 1.625 percent by Monday noon, the long-term prime is more likely to be left unchanged, sources at long-term credit banks said.

The historical low for the long-term prime rate is 2.6 percent recorded in December 1995.
