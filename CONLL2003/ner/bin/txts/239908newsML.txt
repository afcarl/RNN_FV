Investors face tougher challenges in 1997 - Salomon.

HONG KONG 1996-12-06

Policymakers and investors will face tougher challenges in 1997 compared with 1996, said John Lipsky, global chief economist at Salomon Brothers.

"The coming year will be a more difficult one for investors, as bond yields in Group of Seven countries are likely to rise and monetary policy tighten," Lipsky told a gathering in Hong Kong on Friday.

But he said the tightening is in the context of supportive policy action in favor of a Group of Seven consensus of price stability and improving fiscal balance.

As a result, it should set the stage "for renewed good performance in economies and financial markets in the coming years", he said.

Next year, fundamental and market convergence will face renewed stress from higher yields in benchmark government bond markets and, in some cases, tighter monetary policy, Lipsky said.

"However, any bond market sell-offs will be modest compared to those in 1994, when stronger growth in the U.S. and Europe and repeated Federal Reserve rate hikes spurred a stunning bond market sell-off and led to the 1995 global growth slowdown," he said.

Neither the onset of recession nor a reemergence of above-trend growth seems likely in the United States next year, Lipsky said.

He expects gross domestic product growth of about 2.0 percent for 1997, along with a slight boost in core inflation, suggesting no major new thrust for monetary policy changes or large swings in the U.S. Treasury market.

"However, the chances are somewhat better than even that the Federal Reserve will eventually nudge up rates by as much as 50 basis points in response to a return to trend growth and rising unit labour costs," said Lipsky.

The risk of a Fed rate hike points to higher bond yields in coming quarters, but Lipsky said he expects yields to remain below the 1996 highs of 7.25 percent for long-dated bonds.

He said the Fed's efforts to quell inflation have a better chance of success than current market long-run expectations of 3.0 percent inflation reflect, he said.

"Further progress on disinflation over the next few years will help lower bond yields to a 5.0 percent to 6.0 percent range on a sustained basis," Lipsky said.

By the end of 1997, Germany's 10-year Bund yield will likely climb back to 6.5 percent, a yield back-up that will be mirrored in other core EU markets.

Government bond markets in Spain, Portugal, Finland and, to a lesser extend Italy and Sweden, likely will outperform again in 1997. The British Gilt bond market will remain attractive as the implicit inflation premium appears outsized, said Lipsky.

Lipsky said he expects Japan's economy to slow substantially in 1997. He forecasts 10-year government bond yields to rise toward 3.5 percent in the coming year.

He said investors should be more cautious with the emerging markets of East Europe and Latin America, with the across-the-board gains of 1996 unlikely to be repeated.
