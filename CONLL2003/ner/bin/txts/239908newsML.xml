<p>Policymakers and investors will face tougher challenges in 1997 compared with 1996, said John Lipsky, global chief economist at Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>&quot;The coming year will be a more difficult one for investors, as bond yields in Group of Seven countries are likely to rise and monetary policy tighten,&quot; Lipsky told a gathering in Hong Kong on Friday.</p>
<p>But he said the tightening is in the context of supportive policy action in favor of a Group of Seven consensus of price stability and improving fiscal balance.</p>
<p>As a result, it should set the stage &quot;for renewed good performance in economies and financial markets in the coming years&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>Next year, fundamental and market convergence will face renewed stress from higher yields in benchmark government bond markets and, in some cases, tighter monetary policy, Lipsky said.</p>
<p>&quot;However, any bond market sell-offs will be modest compared to those in 1994, when stronger growth in the U.S. and Europe and repeated Federal Reserve rate hikes spurred a stunning bond market sell-off and led to the 1995 global growth slowdown,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Neither the onset of recession nor a reemergence of above-trend growth seems likely in the United States next year, Lipsky said.</p>
<p>He expects gross domestic product growth of about 2.0 percent for 1997, along with a slight boost in core inflation, suggesting no major new thrust for monetary policy changes or large swings in the U.S. Treasury market.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the chances are somewhat better than even that the Federal Reserve will eventually nudge up rates by as much as 50 basis points in response to a return to trend growth and rising unit labour costs,&quot; said Lipsky.</p>
<p>The risk of a Fed rate hike points to higher bond yields in coming quarters, but Lipsky said he expects yields to remain below the 1996 highs of 7.25 percent for long-dated bonds.</p>
<p>He said the Fed's efforts to quell inflation have a better chance of success than current market long-run expectations of 3.0 percent inflation reflect, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Further progress on disinflation over the next few years will help lower bond yields to a 5.0 percent to 6.0 percent range on a sustained basis,&quot; Lipsky said.</p>
<p>By the end of 1997, Germany's 10-year Bund yield will likely climb back to 6.5 percent, a yield back-up that will be mirrored in other core EU markets.</p>
<p>Government bond markets in Spain, Portugal, Finland and, to a lesser extend Italy and Sweden, likely will outperform again in 1997. The British Gilt bond market will remain attractive as the implicit inflation premium appears outsized, said Lipsky.</p>
<p>Lipsky said he expects Japan's economy to slow substantially in 1997. He forecasts 10-year government bond yields to rise toward 3.5 percent in the coming year.</p>
<p>He said investors should be more cautious with the emerging markets of East Europe and Latin America, with the across-the-board gains of 1996 unlikely to be repeated.</p>
