SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Construction and property-based Lim Kah Ngam Ltd said on Friday it was proposing to raise Singapore $100 million through bonds and a transferable loan facility.  

The company said in a statement it would issue S$71 million through an issue of bonds and S$29 million through a transferable loan facility (TLF) to be repaid by year 2001.

Lim Kah Ngam said the net proceeds from the issues will be used in Singapore to refinance existing short term borrowings and to support the expansion of the company's activities.

The company said NDC Merchant Bank Ltd will subscribe for the bonds and may offer them for sale in a private placement to finance institutions and investors.

The bonds will be issued in denominations of S$250,000 each, and will bear a fixed rate interest of three percent per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears.

The loan facility will be extended to Lim Kah Ngam by NDC.
