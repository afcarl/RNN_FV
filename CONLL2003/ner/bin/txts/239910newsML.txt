Jakarta shares recover partially after steep falls.

JAKARTA 1996-12-06

Jakarta share prices recovered partially by the close on Friday after sharp falls on U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's anti-inflation remarks, brokers said.

Some investors began to buy selected blue-chips toward the close, helping the index to recover lost ground, they said.

The Jakarta Composite Index fell 6.17 points, or 0.97 percent, to close at 628.12 points. In early trade, the index had recorded a new year-high of 638.56 points before reaching an intra-day low of 617.17 points. Losers led gainers by 81 to 31, with 56 counters unchanged.  

Brokers said activity was very much in response to Greenspan's comments about an "irrational exuberance" in the U.S. stock market, and a fall in U.S bond markets.

Analysts said investors were worried that the comments could herald an increase in U.S. interest rates.

"Basically, the U.S market may have been looking for an excuse to take profits anyway after performing strongly recently. I think people should not read too much into Greenspan's remarks," Felix D'Souza, head of research of Peregrine Sewu Securities, said.  

D'Souza said he was confident of steady liquidity inflows into the Indonesian equity market for the rest of the year.

"We believe a lot of foreign institutional investors plan to increase their weighting in Indonesia," he added.

An analyst from a Japanese brokerage firm said the impact of Greenspan's remarks would be limited in Jakarta as the country's fundamentals remained strong.

"The market has anticipated that the lending rate would decrease steadily following the central bank rate cut on Thursday," he said.  

Heavyweights Telkom, Bimantara Citra, Citra Marga and Bank Negara Indonesia were among the losers, brokers said.

Bank Negara Indonesia topped the active list with 137.7 million shares traded, falling 25 rupiah to 1,350 after touching a high of 1,425 rupiah, brokers said.

Telkom closed at 4,125 rupiah, down 50 rupiah, after rising to 4,325 rupiah earlier on a volume of 6.8 million shares.

Conglomerate Bimantara Citra fell 100 rupiah to 3,325 rupiah on 3.5 million shares. --- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364
