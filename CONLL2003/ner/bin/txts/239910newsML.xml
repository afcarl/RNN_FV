<p>Jakarta share prices recovered partially by the close on Friday after sharp falls on U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's anti-inflation remarks, brokers said.</p>
<p>Some investors began to buy selected blue-chips toward the close, helping the index to recover lost ground, they said.</p>
<p>The Jakarta Composite Index fell 6.17 points, or 0.97 percent, to close at 628.12 points. In early trade, the index had recorded a new year-high of 638.56 points before reaching an intra-day low of 617.17 points. Losers led gainers by 81 to 31, with 56 counters unchanged.  </p>
<p>Brokers said activity was very much in response to Greenspan's comments about an &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in the U.S. stock market, and a fall in U.S bond markets.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors were worried that the comments could herald an increase in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically, the U.S market may have been looking for an excuse to take profits anyway after performing strongly recently. I think people should not read too much into Greenspan's remarks,&quot; Felix D'Souza, head of research of Peregrine Sewu Securities, said.  </p>
<p>D'Souza said he was confident of steady liquidity inflows into the Indonesian equity market for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe a lot of foreign institutional investors plan to increase their weighting in Indonesia,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>An analyst from a Japanese brokerage firm said the impact of Greenspan's remarks would be limited in Jakarta as the country's fundamentals remained strong.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has anticipated that the lending rate would decrease steadily following the central bank rate cut on Thursday,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Heavyweights Telkom, Bimantara Citra, Citra Marga and Bank Negara Indonesia were among the losers, brokers said.</p>
<p>Bank Negara Indonesia topped the active list with 137.7 million shares traded, falling 25 rupiah to 1,350 after touching a high of 1,425 rupiah, brokers said.</p>
<p>Telkom closed at 4,125 rupiah, down 50 rupiah, after rising to 4,325 rupiah earlier on a volume of 6.8 million shares.</p>
<p>Conglomerate Bimantara Citra fell 100 rupiah to 3,325 rupiah on 3.5 million shares. --- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364</p>
