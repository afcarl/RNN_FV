Financial services said not a pressing WTO issue.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Liberalising trade in financial services will not be a major issue at next week's World Trade Organisation (WTO) conference, David Hartridge, WTO director of trade and services, said on Friday.

"The ministers, I am sure, will say they want to achieve a successful negotiation in 1997, but it is not a matter for negotiation next week," he told reporters.

"There will be statements about it but it won't be negotiated," he said after a Pacific Economic Cooperation Council session on WTO and trade in financial services,

Hartridge said the United States made a major negotiating effort on the financial services sector in 1995 and was expected to do the same in April when talks on the issue resume.

Washington has been pushing to open access to financial markets because it is a major exporter of financial services.

"Their problem is that they do not want to guarantee to keep their market open while other countries in their view maintain closed markets. They want the opening to be more general," Hartridge said.

"I don't suppose they would say that everybody must be as open as they are because they are very open indeed, but they would like more evidence of market opening by countries who are in a position to do it."

Hartridge said there were some signs of improvement in deregulation in some countries which should make it possible for them to improve on their commitments in the WTO.

On the WTO conference, Hartridge said he would be encouraged by "evidence of progress" in negotiations in the telecommunications sector, which has a shorter deadline -- February -- than the the financial services sector.

He said success in telecommunications would be helpful in the financial services context and added: "Failure in telecoms would not improve the situation for financial services."
