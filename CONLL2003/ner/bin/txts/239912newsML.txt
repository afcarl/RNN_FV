Singapore diesel trades at new 5-yr high of $34.45.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Singapore physical gas oil traded on Friday at a new post-Gulf War five-year high of $34.35 a barrel, up $1.45 a barrel from the previous traded record achieved on Thursday, traders said.

The 225,000-barrel cargo was sold by a European major to a Swiss trader for lifting on December 23-27 on a free-on-board Singapore basis.  

Traders said the surge in prices was due to a squeeze on the prompt physical gas oil and a big increase in overnight crude values.

January Brent crude on London's International Petroleum Exchange closed 85 cents higher to $24.64 a barrel, while December gas oil ended up 5.50 a tonne at $229.50.

The market also firmed on strong buying from China, the region's biggest consumer.
