<p>About 200 Burmese students marched briefly from troubled Yangon Institute of Technology in northern Rangoon on Friday towards the University of Yangon six km (four miles) away, and returned to their campus, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute.</p>
<p>There were no clashes.</p>
<p>&quot;They are now back in the YIT campus,&quot; an institute official who declined to be identified told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>One of two roads leading to the University of Yangon from the institute had been closed by authorities.</p>
<p>But about 300 university students were still gathered outside the gates of their campus, witnesses said. They were singing peacefully.</p>
<p>On Monday and Tuesday, students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October.</p>
<p>On Tuesday and Wednesday, opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was restricted to her home by the military government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests. She was allowed to move freely on Thursday.</p>
<p>The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central Rangoon.</p>
<p>The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising. Thousands were killed or imprisoned.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday some of the students, who were held briefly by police during the protests earlier this week, said they were still dissatisfied with the military government.</p>
<p>They told Reuters they were unhappy that the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus.</p>
<p>&quot;We still want government answers to our demands. We want police punishment to be published in newspapers,&quot; one student said.</p>
<p>But the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD).</p>
<p>Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate and daughter of independence hero Aung San, and key NLD officials have also denied any link with the students. But they have said both parties had a &quot;moral link&quot; in that they were against police brutality and injustice.</p>
<p>The students also demanded the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in a brawl with some restaurant owners near the Yangon institute in October.</p>
<p>The students appealed to the government not to close the institute because of their latest demonstration. The institute was shut for nearly two years after the 1988 uprising.</p>
<p>On Friday, the road leading to Suu Kyi's lakeside residence in central Rangoon remained closed by police.</p>
