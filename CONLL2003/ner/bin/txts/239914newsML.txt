Shares in Malaysian property company Advance Synergy Bhd (ASB) have seen active trade this week because of speculation it might be seeking to buy a stake in Ban Hin Lee Bank Bhd, dealers and analysts said.

ASB has been the most actively traded stock for three consecutive days on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.

At the Friday market close, the stock was down 18 cents at 4.46 ringgit, after earlier rising to a year-high of 4.76, on a turnover of 7.33 million shares.

One possible reason for ASB's interest in Ban Hin Lee may arise from its link with the Hong Leong Group, which controls Hong Leong Bank Bhd, analysts said.

"The Hong Leong group controls around five percent of ASB, so they can exercise some influence on ASB (to negotiate with Ban Hin Lee)", said Faez Khairuddin, an analyst at SJ Securities in Kuala Lumpur.

Officials at Advance Synergy, Ban Hin Lee and Hong Leong were not immediately available for comment.

Faez and other analysts said the acquisition of a stake in Ban Hin Lee by ASB would be a way to forge an alliance between Hong Leong Bank and Ban Hin Lee.  

"Ban Hin Lee and Hong Leong Bank are both medium-sized banks, and so it would probably make sense for them to merge," said the head of an investment advisory company in Kuala Lumpur.

Faez said that a merged Ban Hin Lee and Hong Leong Bank would be the "fifth or sixth largest bank in the country, according to assets".

Dealers and analysts speculated that a substantial stake in Ban Hin Lee has been put up for sale by United Merchant Group Bhd, a company controlled by ASB. United Merchant owns direct and indirectly a 44 percent stake in the bank.

Malay entrepreneur, Ahmad Sebi Bakar, is chairman of both ASB and the United Merchant Group.

Ahmad Sebi and other officials at UMG were unavailable for comment.

"I suspect that United Merchant Group is looking to sell its stake in Ban Hin Lee," said Pong Teng Siew, banking analyst at Vickers Ballas Research.

"It does not make sense to hang on to a 44 percent stake and not have board representation," he added. Pong estimated the stake in Ban Hin Lee to be worth around 200 million ringgit.
