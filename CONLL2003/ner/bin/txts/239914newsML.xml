<p>Shares in Malaysian property company Advance Synergy Bhd (ASB) have seen active trade this week because of speculation it might be seeking to buy a stake in Ban Hin Lee Bank Bhd, dealers and analysts said.</p>
<p>ASB has been the most actively traded stock for three consecutive days on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>At the Friday market close, the stock was down 18 cents at 4.46 ringgit, after earlier rising to a year-high of 4.76, on a turnover of 7.33 million shares.</p>
<p>One possible reason for ASB's interest in Ban Hin Lee may arise from its link with the Hong Leong Group, which controls Hong Leong Bank Bhd, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Hong Leong group controls around five percent of ASB, so they can exercise some influence on ASB (to negotiate with Ban Hin Lee)&quot;, said Faez Khairuddin, an analyst at SJ Securities in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Officials at Advance Synergy, Ban Hin Lee and Hong Leong were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Faez and other analysts said the acquisition of a stake in Ban Hin Lee by ASB would be a way to forge an alliance between Hong Leong Bank and Ban Hin Lee.  </p>
<p>&quot;Ban Hin Lee and Hong Leong Bank are both medium-sized banks, and so it would probably make sense for them to merge,&quot; said the head of an investment advisory company in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Faez said that a merged Ban Hin Lee and Hong Leong Bank would be the &quot;fifth or sixth largest bank in the country, according to assets&quot;.</p>
<p>Dealers and analysts speculated that a substantial stake in Ban Hin Lee has been put up for sale by United Merchant Group Bhd, a company controlled by ASB. United Merchant owns direct and indirectly a 44 percent stake in the bank.</p>
<p>Malay entrepreneur, Ahmad Sebi Bakar, is chairman of both ASB and the United Merchant Group.</p>
<p>Ahmad Sebi and other officials at UMG were unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect that United Merchant Group is looking to sell its stake in Ban Hin Lee,&quot; said Pong Teng Siew, banking analyst at Vickers Ballas Research.</p>
<p>&quot;It does not make sense to hang on to a 44 percent stake and not have board representation,&quot; he added. Pong estimated the stake in Ban Hin Lee to be worth around 200 million ringgit.</p>
