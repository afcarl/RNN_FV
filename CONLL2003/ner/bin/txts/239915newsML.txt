Directors cut Informatics stakes further.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Informatics Holdings Ltd said on Friday four major shareholders had sold a total of 12 million shares on Thursday at Singapore $0.62 each.

The four are directors Wong Tai, Ong Boon Kheng, Cheah Hon Kuen and Wong Kock Meng.

The company said in a statement the four, together with Dave Chong, were equity holders of ASV Holdings Pte Ltd which holds 55 percent stake in Informatics.

Informatics chairman and chief executive officer Wong Tai said the sale of the directors' shares would give investors more opportunities to invest in the company.

The directors have been reducing their stakes in Informatics since last December.
