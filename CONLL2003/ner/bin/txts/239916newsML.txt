IRSG economist sees natural rubber supply shortage.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

The chief economist of the International Rubber Study Group (IRSG) said on Friday that a shortage in natural rubber supply may develop as the top three producers industrialise rapidly at a time when demand is growing steadily.

Prachaya Jumpasut of the IRSG said the three major producing countries of Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia may soon find that the cost of producing rubber may rise too sharply as a result of rapid growth and industrialisation.  

"This has already resulted in a decline in natural rubber output in Malaysia and next will be Thailand and Indonesia," Prachaya said.

Malaysian output in 1995 dived to 1.08 million tonnes from a high of 1.66 million tonnes in 1988. Exports plunged to 1.01 million tonnes last year form 1.55 million tonnes in 1988, industry officials from Malaysia said.

Demand for rubber, on the other hand, is expected to rise steadily.  

"The forecast of an increase of over 3.0 percent for 1997 is still achievable as there are signs that the slowdown in the major industrialised economies was temporary. Resumption of growth in the transition economies and the return to the long-term trend of export growth in Asia can then be expected," he said.

World rubber production is seen rising to around 17.5 million tonnes in 2000 from 15.2 million tonnes last year. About 10.3 million tonnes of total world supply will come from Asia.  

Prachaya said a supply crunch will pressure prices over the next few years especially if there is a fall in output in the three major producers.
