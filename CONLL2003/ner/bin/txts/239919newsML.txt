RESEARCH ALERT - Thakral stock seen rising.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Brokerage Vickers Ballas said on Friday shares in consumer electronics group Thakral Corp had outperformed the market and were on an upward trend.

Earnings growth was being driven by "burgeoning" China markets, it said in a note to clients.

"Rising disposable income and low penetration rate for consumer audio-visual products in China augur well for the group," Vickers said.

The report said Thakral shares, currently trading at US$0.87, had just broken out of a strong resistance area.  

"This implies great strength in the trend," said Vickers. "Expect the rally to continue to target at US$0.95."
