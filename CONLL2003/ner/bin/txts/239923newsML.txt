Record Asian transport fuel prices seen staying up.

Soaring Asian prices of transport fuels jet and diesel are unlikely to drop much below current five-year record levels for at least another month as regional demand surges, industry sources said on Friday.

They said supplies were also tight, putting further pressure on prices. Jet fuel and diesel on Thursday traded at new five-year records of $34.20 per barrel and $33 per barrel, both on a free-on-board Singapore basis.

Benchmark Singapore jet fuel and diesel prices have risen by about 23 percent in the first 11 months of this year from the 1995 average price of around $22.75 and $21.60 a barrel.

As a result, several Asian airlines are seeking to raise international passenger fares by about three percent.

Traders said the market was unlikely to ease swiftly as most regional producers had sold their December cargoes and some had even committed their January output.

They said record purchases of jet fuel by South Korea and diesel by China had further spurred the bull run. Other Asian consumers such as Japan, Indonesia and India also played their part in keeping prices high by buying more than usual.

South Korea doubled its December spot jet fuel purchases over November to around 300,000 tonnes on expectations of a cold winter and a delay to the startup of a new crude unit.

LG-Caltex Oil Corp, a unit of the LG Group, delayed the start of a 220,000 barrel per day crude distillation unit by one month to late December when defects were discovered.

Japan and Indonesia raised their jet fuel purchases for December arrival by 20 to 30 percent, Japan in preparation for winter and Indonesia because of the Ramadan holidays.

China bought at least an extra 100,000 tonnes, or 20 percent more than usual, for December because of reduced crude runs at its inland refineries.

"Since around September, refineries in China have cut output by between 10 and 20 percent due to high crude oil prices," a source at state-refiner SINOPEC told Reuters.

Chinese December diesel purchases are expected to total between 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes, traders said.

India bought an unexpectedly large 520,000 tonnes of diesel for arrival in December, well above initial market expectations of about 300,000 tonnes.

For January, India bought 255,000 tonnes, but it has since issued a supplementary tender and the market expects India's final January purchases to match those of December.

These unexpectedly large purchases have led to a severe squeeze on regional supplies, and most Asian refiners do not have spot jet fuel or diesel for sale in December.

The situation was exacerbated by the absence of new arbitrage exports from the West as prices there have also risen following the onset of colder weather.

"For the East-West arbitrage to work smoothly, prices in the East must be about $20 (a tonne) above the West," said a trader.

Based on prevailing spot prices this differential is now around $15 per tonne, he said.

Soaring crude oil prices are also expected to support rising jet fuel and diesel prices in Asia, one trader said.

January Brent crude rose on Thursday by a hefty 85 cents to $24.64 a barrel, but still was off the previous front month five-year high of $25.06 chalked up in October.
