Indonesian rupiah weakens on dlr short-covering.

JAKARTA 1996-12-06

The Indonesian rupiah weakened against the dollar in slow late trading on Friday following late short dollar covering, dealers said.

They said late short dollar covering from Singapore players seemed to have driven the dollar up sharply.

One local bank dealer said Singapore operators might have felt uncomfortable in the afternoon with heavy rupiah exposures after aggresive dollars selling in the past few days.

"They might want to reduce exposures due to the weekend factor but the market was already thin late on Friday. The late move seems to have driven the rupiah down," the dealer said.  

Other dealers said, however, ample liquidity was also helpful for a dollar rebound after the U.S. currency had been under pressure for some time.

"Sentiment on the dollar seems to have improved. Trading in the afternoon was also liquidity-driven," one dealer said.

The dealer said sentiment on dollars seemed to have turned around on flush liquidity and cheap roll-over costs.

Spot rupiah fell to 2,352.0/53.0 at 0910 GMT from an opening of 2,348.5/49.5. Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,348.8/49.3 and 2,347.75/48.15, respectively.
