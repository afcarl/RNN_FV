<headline>Indonesian rupiah weakens on dlr short-covering.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>The Indonesian rupiah weakened against the dollar in slow late trading on Friday following late short dollar covering, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said late short dollar covering from Singapore players seemed to have driven the dollar up sharply.</p>
<p>One local bank dealer said Singapore operators might have felt uncomfortable in the afternoon with heavy rupiah exposures after aggresive dollars selling in the past few days.</p>
<p>&quot;They might want to reduce exposures due to the weekend factor but the market was already thin late on Friday. The late move seems to have driven the rupiah down,&quot; the dealer said.  </p>
<p>Other dealers said, however, ample liquidity was also helpful for a dollar rebound after the U.S. currency had been under pressure for some time.</p>
<p>&quot;Sentiment on the dollar seems to have improved. Trading in the afternoon was also liquidity-driven,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The dealer said sentiment on dollars seemed to have turned around on flush liquidity and cheap roll-over costs.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah fell to 2,352.0/53.0 at 0910 GMT from an opening of 2,348.5/49.5. Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,348.8/49.3 and 2,347.75/48.15, respectively.</p>
