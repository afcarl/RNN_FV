Asia Product Swaps-Gas oil extends overnight rally.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Singapore gas oil swaps extended its rally late Friday afternoon on sharp overnight crude gains and tight regional supplies, market sources said.

Prices were also boosted by strong demand from major regional consumer China.

January gas oil swaps traded actively higher throughout the day. It opened to trade this morning at $32.80 a barrel and rose to a day's high of $33.07, brokers said. January was last quoted at $33.10/$33.20, up by more than $1.00 a barrel from Thursday, they said.  

The prompt December swap also rose substantially but trading was thin. It traded at a record $33.80 early Friday morning and was last quoted at $33.80/$33.90, up from Thursday's $32.80/$33.00.

Traders said Friday's surge in prices was primarily crude driven on the back of an already hyped-up market. January Brent crude on London's International Petroleum Exchange closed 85 cents higher to $24.64 a barrel, while December gas oil ended up $5.50 at $229.50 a tonne.  

Sentiment was also boosted by wet cargo trade on Thursday at a new five-year high of $33.00 a barrel on a free-on-board basis, traders said.

The jet fuel market was firm with the jet fuel/gas oil spread or regrade edging up in spite of the $1.00 per barrel hike in gas oil prices.

January regrade was traded on Friday afternoon at $1.83 a barrel and was last quoted at $1.70/$1.80 a barrel up 10 cents from late Thursday's quotes.

Traders said this suggested more physical demand for jet fuel is likely to emerge from North Asia.  

They said the market was also supported by renewed physical buying with a trade done on Thursday at a new five-year high of $34.20 per barrel on a free-on-board Singapore basis.

Fuel oil swaps edged up slightly higher despite the sharp rise to crude prices with most sellers uncertain over mid-term price direction, brokers said.

January was last quoted at $121.50/123.00 a tonne, up about $1.50 from Thursday.

January naphtha rose sharply in line with the stronger crude in thin trade and was last quoted $24.65/25.00 a barrel from Thursday's $23.90/$24.10.
