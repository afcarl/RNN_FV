<p>Singapore gas oil swaps extended its rally late Friday afternoon on sharp overnight crude gains and tight regional supplies, market sources said.</p>
<p>Prices were also boosted by strong demand from major regional consumer China.</p>
<p>January gas oil swaps traded actively higher throughout the day. It opened to trade this morning at $32.80 a barrel and rose to a day's high of $33.07, brokers said. January was last quoted at $33.10/$33.20, up by more than $1.00 a barrel from Thursday, they said.  </p>
<p>The prompt December swap also rose substantially but trading was thin. It traded at a record $33.80 early Friday morning and was last quoted at $33.80/$33.90, up from Thursday's $32.80/$33.00.</p>
<p>Traders said Friday's surge in prices was primarily crude driven on the back of an already hyped-up market. January Brent crude on London's International Petroleum Exchange closed 85 cents higher to $24.64 a barrel, while December gas oil ended up $5.50 at $229.50 a tonne.  </p>
<p>Sentiment was also boosted by wet cargo trade on Thursday at a new five-year high of $33.00 a barrel on a free-on-board basis, traders said.</p>
<p>The jet fuel market was firm with the jet fuel/gas oil spread or regrade edging up in spite of the $1.00 per barrel hike in gas oil prices.</p>
<p>January regrade was traded on Friday afternoon at $1.83 a barrel and was last quoted at $1.70/$1.80 a barrel up 10 cents from late Thursday's quotes.</p>
<p>Traders said this suggested more physical demand for jet fuel is likely to emerge from North Asia.  </p>
<p>They said the market was also supported by renewed physical buying with a trade done on Thursday at a new five-year high of $34.20 per barrel on a free-on-board Singapore basis.</p>
<p>Fuel oil swaps edged up slightly higher despite the sharp rise to crude prices with most sellers uncertain over mid-term price direction, brokers said.</p>
<p>January was last quoted at $121.50/123.00 a tonne, up about $1.50 from Thursday.</p>
<p>January naphtha rose sharply in line with the stronger crude in thin trade and was last quoted $24.65/25.00 a barrel from Thursday's $23.90/$24.10.  </p>
