PCIBank unit sees 30 pct annual growth.

MANILA 1996-12-06

PCI Leasing & Finance Inc is projecting at least 30 percent annual net income growth over the next five years, the company said in documents released on Friday.

Executive vice president Rene Buenaventura, in a presentation made during the firm's initial public offering, said the continued economic growth would spur greater need for leasing and financing especially by its prime commercial clients and small and medium enterprises.

The company's loan receivables have grown 41.6 percent since 1993, totalling 3.706 billion pesos by the end of last year, Buenaventura added.

He said the past due level was kept at 3.4 percent at June this year, while write-offs were less than one percent of the net portfolio since 1993.

Most of its clients were in the construction and services sectors. Eighty-seven percent of its total portfolio were either secured or collateralised.

The company posted a 140 million peso net income last year. Net profits in the first half this year grew by 39.7 percent to 125.1 million from 89 million in the same period last year.  

PCI Leasing, a subsidiary of the Philippine Commercial International Bank (PCIBank), is selling 121.22 million shares at 6.95 pesos per share.

The offering period starts on December 11 and ends on December 20.

The company will use proceeds of the shares sale for branch expansion, improvement of its information technology network and retirement of debt.
