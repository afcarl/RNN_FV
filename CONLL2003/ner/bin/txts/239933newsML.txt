RESEARCH ALERT - Primetown a 'trading buy'.

MANILA 1996-12-06

Urbancorp Securities Inc said on Friday it had recommended a trading buy on condominium builder Primetown Property Inc due to its undervalued stock and strong income growth prospect.

"Strong income growth, numerous successful developments and landbank acquisitions all bode well for the company's future ... At its current price, the issue is valued at an attractive 1996 P/E multiple of 7.6 times, much cheaper than the property sector's 27 times P/E," Urbancorp said in a study.

The company posted a 85.7 percent increase in nine-month net income to 403 million pesos, up from 217 million pesos registered in the same period last year.

The company has several projects in the pipeline in several parts of the country.

"Over time, Primetown will be ranked among the bigger property companies," Urbancorp added.
