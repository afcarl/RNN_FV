SIMEX Brent futures nudge higher in light trade.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

SIMEX Brent crude futures were traded marginally higher from its last close on London's IPE with the market uptrend still intact, brokers said late Friday.

January contract was last traded at $24.65 per barrel, up just two cents from its London close of $24.63. Volumes were light with only 20 lots traded.

February was traded at $23.79, also up two cents from its last settlement. A total of 82 lots changed hands at 0820 GMT.

"The prompt month is likely to test resistance at $24.80 before coming off on profit-taking interests," said a broker  

"The market is still underpinned by support from the cold weather in the U.S. and a large draw down of distillates stocks," said another broker.

NYMEX January crude on the after-hours ACCESS system rose 12 cents at $25.70, against its last official close of $25.58 in very light trade, brokers said.
