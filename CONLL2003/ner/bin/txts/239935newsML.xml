<p>SIMEX Brent crude futures were traded marginally higher from its last close on London's IPE with the market uptrend still intact, brokers said late Friday.</p>
<p>January contract was last traded at $24.65 per barrel, up just two cents from its London close of $24.63. Volumes were light with only 20 lots traded.</p>
<p>February was traded at $23.79, also up two cents from its last settlement. A total of 82 lots changed hands at 0820 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;The prompt month is likely to test resistance at $24.80 before coming off on profit-taking interests,&quot; said a broker  </p>
<p>&quot;The market is still underpinned by support from the cold weather in the U.S. and a large draw down of distillates stocks,&quot; said another broker.</p>
<p>NYMEX January crude on the after-hours ACCESS system rose 12 cents at $25.70, against its last official close of $25.58 in very light trade, brokers said.</p>
