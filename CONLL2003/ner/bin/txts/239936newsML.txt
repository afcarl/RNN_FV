Malaysia's Public Bank raises base rate.

KUALA LUMPUR 1996-12-06

Public Bank Bhd, one of Malaysia's top five banks, said on Friday it was raising its base lending rate (BLR) by five basis points to 9.25 percent.

It said in a statement that the rise in the BLR, a bank's minimum lending rate, would be effective from Saturday.

The increase reflected the cost of funds in the market, director Razak Dali said in the statement.

Bank Negara has, through a formula introduced at the beginning of the year, linked the BLR to the benchmark three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR).
