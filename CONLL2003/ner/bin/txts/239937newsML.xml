<title>QATAR: Saudi-brokered Qatar-Bahrain mediation fails.</title>
<headline>Saudi-brokered Qatar-Bahrain mediation fails.</headline>
<dateline>DOHA 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Bahrain and Qatar failed on Friday to respond to a Saudi Arabian-brokered mediation effort ahead of the annual Gulf Arab summit, official sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;The foreign ministers of Bahrain and Qatar were invited to go to the Kingdom for talks at 1500 (1200 GMT) but we did not go,&quot; said a well-placed Qatari source without explaining the reason.</p>
<p>Bahrain official denied reports its foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammad bin Mubarak al-Khalifa, had gone to the Riyadh talks, reiterating it would boycott the annual Gulf Arab summit which opens in Doha on Saturday.</p>
<p>The two tiny Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states are locked in a dispute over a cluster of potentially rich islands and sandbanks held by Bahrain since the 1930s and claimed by Qatar.</p>
<p>This week the two exchanged accusations after Bahrain put on trial two Qataris, a man and a woman, on spying charges. Qatar has denied the charge.</p>
<p>Qatari officials have not completely discounted last minute efforts to convince Bahrain to send a delegation to the summit although diplomats say a reversal in the boycott decision appeared remote.</p>
<p>Qatar kept its GCC partners guessing in 1992 when it showed up for the GCC summit in Abu Dhabi at the last minute after Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak conducted shuttle mediation between Saudi Arabia and Qatar in another border dispute.</p>
<p>Leaders of Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and host Qatar are all due in Doha on Saturday for the six-nation GCC summit. A boycott by Bahrain would be the first since the political and economic alliance was formed in 1981.</p>
