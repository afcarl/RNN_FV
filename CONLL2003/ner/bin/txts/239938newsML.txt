Bahrain, Qatar deny reconciliation try.

DOHA 1996-12-06

Bahrain and Qatar denied on Friday their foreign ministers had flown to Riyadh as part of a Saudi Arabian reconciliation effort to avert a Bahraini boycott of the annual Gulf Arab summit.

Bahrain's official Gulf News Agency issued a formal denial that Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammad bin Mubarak al-Khalifa had gone to Saudi Arabia.

In Doha a well-placed official said Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani did not fly to Saudi Arabia as another official had earlier said.

Bahrain reiterated on Friday it would not attend the summit, which opens in Doha on Saturday. The two countries are locked in a territorial dispute, further complicated this week by Bahraini charges of Qatari spying.

Bahrain put two Qataris, a man and a woman, on trial this week on charges of spying. Qatar, which has had the border dispute with Bahrain since the 1930s, has denied the spying charge.

Efforts to persuade Bahrain to drop its boycott were dealt a blow earlier on Friday when Qatar accused Bahrain of torturing the accused Qatari man, Hamad al-Baker.

No state has boycotted a GCC summit since the formation of the Gulf Cooperation Council in 1981 by OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and small oil producers Oman and Bahrain.

However, this year's host, Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani boycotted last year's GCC closing session in Oman and his delegation walked out to protest against the method used to appoint a new GCC secretary-general.

Qatar's state-run television said the Qatari emir, accompanied by Sheikh Hamad, visited Baker's family -- a sign diplomats said reflected Qatar's tough stand against Bahrain despite the Saudi mediation.

It showed Baker's father weeping as he described to his royal guests "the poor state in which he found his son when he saw him in court on Wednesday".

Bahrain's State Security Court has adjourned the trial of Baker and Salwa Jassim Mohammad until December 14 at the request of their defence team, a lawyer and a government official said on Thursday.
