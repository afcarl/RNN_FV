<title>QATAR: Bahrain, Qatar deny reconciliation try.</title>
<headline>Bahrain, Qatar deny reconciliation try.</headline>
<dateline>DOHA 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Bahrain and Qatar denied on Friday their foreign ministers had flown to Riyadh as part of a Saudi Arabian reconciliation effort to avert a Bahraini boycott of the annual Gulf Arab summit.</p>
<p>Bahrain's official Gulf News Agency issued a formal denial that Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammad bin Mubarak al-Khalifa had gone to Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>In Doha a well-placed official said Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani did not fly to Saudi Arabia as another official had earlier said.</p>
<p>Bahrain reiterated on Friday it would not attend the summit, which opens in Doha on Saturday. The two countries are locked in a territorial dispute, further complicated this week by Bahraini charges of Qatari spying.</p>
<p>Bahrain put two Qataris, a man and a woman, on trial this week on charges of spying. Qatar, which has had the border dispute with Bahrain since the 1930s, has denied the spying charge.</p>
<p>Efforts to persuade Bahrain to drop its boycott were dealt a blow earlier on Friday when Qatar accused Bahrain of torturing the accused Qatari man, Hamad al-Baker.</p>
<p>No state has boycotted a GCC summit since the formation of the Gulf Cooperation Council in 1981 by OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and small oil producers Oman and Bahrain.</p>
<p>However, this year's host, Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani boycotted last year's GCC closing session in Oman and his delegation walked out to protest against the method used to appoint a new GCC secretary-general.</p>
<p>Qatar's state-run television said the Qatari emir, accompanied by Sheikh Hamad, visited Baker's family -- a sign diplomats said reflected Qatar's tough stand against Bahrain despite the Saudi mediation.</p>
<p>It showed Baker's father weeping as he described to his royal guests &quot;the poor state in which he found his son when he saw him in court on Wednesday&quot;.</p>
<p>Bahrain's State Security Court has adjourned the trial of Baker and Salwa Jassim Mohammad until December 14 at the request of their defence team, a lawyer and a government official said on Thursday.</p>
