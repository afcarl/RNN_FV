A top Qatari official returned from surprise talks in Riyadh on Friday as part of last-minute Saudi efforts to solve problems blocking Bahrain from attending a Gulf Arab summit opening in Doha on Saturday.

"The foreign minister (Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani) has just come back from Riyadh and we hope Bahrain might review its decision to boycott the summit," a Qatari official told Reuters.

Sheikh Hamad met his Saudi counterpart, Prince Saud al-Faisal, whose country is the power broker in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, the official added.

He said Prince Saud also held separate talks with Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammad bin Mubarak al-Khalifa in Riyadh on Friday in a bid to narrow differences, the official added.

He gave no further details and Bahraini and Saudi officials were not immediately available for comment.

Diplomats said it was not clear if Bahrain, locked in a border dispute and spy row with Qatar, would reverse its decision to boycott the annual three-day summit.

Even if Manama changes its stand, GCC officials said Bahrain's Emir Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa was reluctant to head his country's delegation.

Bahrain put two Qataris, a man and a woman, on trial this week on charges of spying. Qatar, which has had the border dispute with Bahrain since the 1930s, has denied the spying charge.

Efforts to persuade Bahrain to drop its boycott were dealt a blow earlier on Friday when Qatar accused Bahrain of torturing the accused Qatari man, Hamad al-Baker.

No state has boycotted a GCC summit since the formation of the Gulf Cooperation Council in 1981 by OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and small oil producers Oman and Bahrain.

However, this year's host, Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani boycotted last year's GCC closing session in Oman and his delegation walked out to protest against the method used to appoint a new GCC secretary-general.

Qatar's state-run television said the Qatari emir, accompanied by Sheikh Hamad, visited Baker's family -- a sign diplomats said reflected Qatar's tough stand against Bahrain despite the Saudi mediation.

It showed Baker's father weeping as he described to his royal guests "the poor state in which he found his son when he saw him in court on Wednesday".

Bahrain's State Security Court has adjourned the trial of Baker and Salwa Jassim Mohammad until December 14 at the request of their defence team, a lawyer and a government official said on Thursday.
