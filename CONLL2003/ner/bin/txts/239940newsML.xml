<p>A top Qatari official returned from surprise talks in Riyadh on Friday as part of last-minute Saudi efforts to solve problems blocking Bahrain from attending a Gulf Arab summit opening in Doha on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The foreign minister (Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani) has just come back from Riyadh and we hope Bahrain might review its decision to boycott the summit,&quot; a Qatari official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Sheikh Hamad met his Saudi counterpart, Prince Saud al-Faisal, whose country is the power broker in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, the official added.</p>
<p>He said Prince Saud also held separate talks with Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammad bin Mubarak al-Khalifa in Riyadh on Friday in a bid to narrow differences, the official added.</p>
<p>He gave no further details and Bahraini and Saudi officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Diplomats said it was not clear if Bahrain, locked in a border dispute and spy row with Qatar, would reverse its decision to boycott the annual three-day summit.</p>
<p>Even if Manama changes its stand, GCC officials said Bahrain's Emir Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa was reluctant to head his country's delegation.</p>
<p>Bahrain put two Qataris, a man and a woman, on trial this week on charges of spying. Qatar, which has had the border dispute with Bahrain since the 1930s, has denied the spying charge.</p>
<p>Efforts to persuade Bahrain to drop its boycott were dealt a blow earlier on Friday when Qatar accused Bahrain of torturing the accused Qatari man, Hamad al-Baker.</p>
<p>No state has boycotted a GCC summit since the formation of the Gulf Cooperation Council in 1981 by OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and small oil producers Oman and Bahrain.</p>
<p>However, this year's host, Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani boycotted last year's GCC closing session in Oman and his delegation walked out to protest against the method used to appoint a new GCC secretary-general.</p>
<p>Qatar's state-run television said the Qatari emir, accompanied by Sheikh Hamad, visited Baker's family -- a sign diplomats said reflected Qatar's tough stand against Bahrain despite the Saudi mediation.</p>
<p>It showed Baker's father weeping as he described to his royal guests &quot;the poor state in which he found his son when he saw him in court on Wednesday&quot;.</p>
<p>Bahrain's State Security Court has adjourned the trial of Baker and Salwa Jassim Mohammad until December 14 at the request of their defence team, a lawyer and a government official said on Thursday.</p>
