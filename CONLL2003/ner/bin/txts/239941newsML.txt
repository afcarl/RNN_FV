Jordan PM meets Iraqi foreign minister.

AMMAN 1996-12-06

Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul Karim al-Kabariti on Friday held talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf as the kingdom seeks reconciliation with its estranged neighbour, officials said.

Sahaf, who arrived on Friday en route to an undisclosed destination, declined to comment to reporters on his arrival at the prime minister's Amman residence.

King Hussein, in a surprise move, later showed up to join their meeting in one of the first publicised high-level political encounters between the monarch and a senior Iraqi cabinet minister since turning against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last year.

The king sheltered leading Iraqi defectors and has allowed Iraqi opposition groups calling for Saddam's overthrow to set up offices in Jordan.

But Jordan has been stepping up efforts to mend strained ties since Baghdad reached agreement last month with the United Nations for implementation of its long-delayed oil-for-food deal.

Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh passed through Amman this week on the way to Vietnam and is due to return for talks on Sunday with Kabariti. A Jordanian ministerial delegation is due to visit Baghdad soon.

Jordan, keen to capitalise on the slight easing of crippling six-year sanctions on its neighbour and trading partner, is trying to secure contracts to supply Baghdad with more medicine, vegetable oil and detergents exempt from the U.N. blockade.
