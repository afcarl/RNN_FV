<title>JORDAN: Jordan PM meets Iraqi foreign minister.</title>
<headline>Jordan PM meets Iraqi foreign minister.</headline>
<dateline>AMMAN 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul Karim al-Kabariti on Friday held talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf as the kingdom seeks reconciliation with its estranged neighbour, officials said.</p>
<p>Sahaf, who arrived on Friday en route to an undisclosed destination, declined to comment to reporters on his arrival at the prime minister's Amman residence.</p>
<p>King Hussein, in a surprise move, later showed up to join their meeting in one of the first publicised high-level political encounters between the monarch and a senior Iraqi cabinet minister since turning against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last year.</p>
<p>The king sheltered leading Iraqi defectors and has allowed Iraqi opposition groups calling for Saddam's overthrow to set up offices in Jordan.</p>
<p>But Jordan has been stepping up efforts to mend strained ties since Baghdad reached agreement last month with the United Nations for implementation of its long-delayed oil-for-food deal.</p>
<p>Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh passed through Amman this week on the way to Vietnam and is due to return for talks on Sunday with Kabariti. A Jordanian ministerial delegation is due to visit Baghdad soon.</p>
<p>Jordan, keen to capitalise on the slight easing of crippling six-year sanctions on its neighbour and trading partner, is trying to secure contracts to supply Baghdad with more medicine, vegetable oil and detergents exempt from the U.N. blockade.</p>
