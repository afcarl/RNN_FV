Bahrain appears set to boycott Gulf summit.

Gulf Arab leaders gather in Qatar on Saturday for their annual summit but Bahrain appears set to boycott the event after Saudi Arabian mediation attempts failed.

Bahraini flags and posters of its leader, Emir Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, were put up in Doha together with those of other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states.

But organisers and diplomats do not expect Bahrain to attend because of differences with host state Qatar. The foreign ministers of Qatar and Bahrain were invited to go to Saudi Arabia on Friday for reconciliation talks but they did not show up.

Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani "was very interested on Thursday to go for the talks but he changed his mind", said a well-placed official without giving a reason.

If Bahrain stayed away from the annual summit, it would become the first state since the GCC was formed in 1981 to boycott the event from the start.

Qatar and Bahrain exchanged accusations this week after the Bahraini authorities put two Qataris, a man and a woman, on trial on spying charges. Qatar has dismissed the charges as ridiculous.

Qatar, locked in a border dispute with Bahrain, won the embarrassing distinction of being the first state to boycott part of a GCC summit when its delegation walked out of last year's final session in Oman to protest against the appointment of a new secretary-general for the six-nation group.

The alliance was orginally formed as an economic and political group but since then plans have been introduced for security cooperation and integration of defences.

So far many of the ambitious targets, like forming a common market and resolving border disputes, have not been met.

A GCC military delegate told Reuters defence integration had been cut "to realistic plans which need time for implementation".

The GCC includes oil-exporting heavyweights Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. The six states combined control about half of the world's proven oil reserves but, as the GCC's main ally Washington says, they live in a "tough neighbourhood".

After the initial shock and realisation of their military weakness when Iraq stormed into Kuwait in 1990, most GCC states have opted for defence accords with Western powers while they slowly try to build up their individual forces.

During a Gulf tour last week, outgoing U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry warned that regional powers Iraq and non-Arab Iran had designs to control the area's oil wealth. The area accounts for 70 percent of world reserves.

Perry discussed with several GCC leaders Iran's rearmament programme and provided intelligence on its military and other plans, well-placed sources told Reuters.

The summit is due to discuss obstacles blocking economic and military integration, ways of dealing with Iraq and Iran, the Middle East peace process and other political issues.
