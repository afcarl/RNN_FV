Lebanon gang members killed accomplice -- sources.

BEIRUT 1996-12-06

Three Beirut gang members charged with making 15 billion Lebanese pounds by selling forged and genuine revenue stamps murdered a finance ministry official party to the embezzlement, judicial sources said on Friday.

They said Mohammad Harmoush and Tony Tayyar -- both Lebanese -- and a Palestinian man named Farid Mousalli killed by police last month, had shot dead Ra'afat Sleiman, who was responsible for the sale of the stamps at the ministry.

The embezzlement case has caused a sensation in Lebanon in recent months.

Sleiman's fate has been a mystery since late October when a prosecutor charged all four men and two others with forging revenue stamps and selling for private gain genuine stamps supplied by the ministry for a total of 15 billion pounds.

Mousalli was killed by Lebanese police on November 17.

The sources said that police were searching for Sleiman's body in bushes near the northern village of Ghosta, where the killers buried it.

Acting finance minister Fouad Siniora last month denied that the embezzlement totalled 15 billion pounds, saying it totalled 3.8 billion. ($1 = 1,553 Lebanese pounds)
