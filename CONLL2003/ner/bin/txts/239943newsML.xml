<p>Three Beirut gang members charged with making 15 billion Lebanese pounds by selling forged and genuine revenue stamps murdered a finance ministry official party to the embezzlement, judicial sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said Mohammad Harmoush and Tony Tayyar -- both Lebanese -- and a Palestinian man named Farid Mousalli killed by police last month, had shot dead Ra'afat Sleiman, who was responsible for the sale of the stamps at the ministry.</p>
<p>The embezzlement case has caused a sensation in Lebanon in recent months.</p>
<p>Sleiman's fate has been a mystery since late October when a prosecutor charged all four men and two others with forging revenue stamps and selling for private gain genuine stamps supplied by the ministry for a total of 15 billion pounds.</p>
<p>Mousalli was killed by Lebanese police on November 17.</p>
<p>The sources said that police were searching for Sleiman's body in bushes near the northern village of Ghosta, where the killers buried it.</p>
<p>Acting finance minister Fouad Siniora last month denied that the embezzlement totalled 15 billion pounds, saying it totalled 3.8 billion. ($1 = 1,553 Lebanese pounds)</p>
