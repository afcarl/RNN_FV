<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on Friday that he expected Madeleine Albright, nominated as the new U.S. Secretary of State, to direct U.S. policy in line with the Arab-Israeli peace accords.</p>
<p>Egyptian television said Moussa, speaking during a visit to London, hoped the U.S. would continue its role as co-sponsor to the peace process under Albright.</p>
<p>&quot;Moussa said that Egypt does not reject or fear the appointment of Madeleine Albright as U.S. Secretary of State,&quot; Nile TV said in an English language broadcast.</p>
<p>&quot;The foreign minister said that he is looking forward to strengthening cooperation with Albright. He said that he expects (her) to direct her country's policies in the Middle East in the light of Madrid and previous peace agreements.&quot;</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton on Thursday nominated his outspoken United Nations representative to succeed Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who plans to retire from politics when the new administration is sworn in. Congress is expected to approve Albright's nomination.</p>
<p>The United States has played a key role in nudging Israelis and Arabs to the negotiation table in 1991 and stepped in when talks hit a snag over implementing agreed-upon peace accords.</p>
<p>President Clinton hosted the signing of two self-rule deals between Israel and the PLO in Washington and presided over the signing of the 1994 Israeli-Jordanian peace agreement.</p>
