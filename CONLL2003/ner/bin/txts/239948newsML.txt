U.S. flies Iraqi aid workers from Turkey to Guam.

DIYARBAKIR, Turkey 1996-12-06

The United States on Friday flew several hundred Iraqi employees of U.S.-linked aid organisations evacuated from nothern Iraq to the Pacific island of Guam, Turkish security officials said.

The emergency rule governor's office told Reuters some 430 Iraqis were flown from Batman airport at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT) in southeast Turkey for Guam. They had been brought to Turkey from northern Iraq on Wednesday and housed at a gendarmerie post.

It was the first group to be flown to Guam out of 4,500 Iraqis whom a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman has said would be evacuated to the U.S. territory via Turkey over the next two weeks.

Washington evacuated about 2,700 Iraqi Kurds and other opposition figures mostly in September in response to concerns about Baghdad's increasing influence in northern Iraq.

Iraqi troops crossed into the Kurdish region of northern Iraq for the first time in five years in late August to help one Kurdish militia in fighting against a rival.

Iraq's Kurds broke from Baghdad after the Gulf War in 1991 under the shield of U.S.-led allied air patrols.
