Kuwait's PM to meet Pope John Paul on December 13.

DUBAI 1996-12-06

Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah will meet Pope John Paul in the Vatican on December 13, the official Kuwaiti News Agency (KUNA) said on Friday.

It would be the first such high-level meeting since both sides set up diplomatic ties in 1969.

"Their meeting coincides with Kuwait's decision to approve a Vatican request to open an apostolic nunciature (embassy) in Kuwait and appoint a resident ambassador after the visit to Kuwait by the Vatican's foreign minister," it added.

The Vatican's foreign minister Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran visited Kuwait late last month. During his visit, he met church and government officials, chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said in a statement.

Tauran found the Catholic community "vibrant and active", although it had only seven priests, and enjoyed religious freedom, the statement said.

"In meetings with civil authorities, Monsignor Tauran stressed this positive fact many times. It is all the more important if seen in relation to other situations in the region, where Christians do not enjoy the same freedom," it added.

The statement did not elaborate. Saudi Arabia, which borders Kuwait, bans public Christian worship.

Navarro-Valls said the Roman Catholic community in Kuwait numbered about 100,000, predominantly foreign workers from India, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Arab countries and western countries "with the exception of a few Kuwaiti families".

He said Tauran met Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah and Sheikh Saad as well as government ministers.

KUNA said Sheikh Saad's talks with the pope will also cover 600 Kuwaitis and people of other nationalities missing since Iraq's 1990-91 occupation of the Gulf state.
