The European Union on Friday told a meeting of businessmen it was not an "indefinite funds provider" and south Mediterranean countries needed to modernise their economies to attract foreign investment.

The two-day meeting that started on Thursday in the southern tourist city of Marrakesh drew more than 400 businessmen from 25 Mediterranean and European countries.

"I told the Marrakesh meeting that we are not Santa Claus...The south Mediterranean countries have to work hard to upgrade their economies and modernise the working tools to attract foreign investors," EU spokesman Marc Pierini told a news conference.

Pierini said EU's European Bank of Investment invested an average 1.0 billion Ecus ($1.2 billion) annually in infrastructure and financial projects mainly in the southern basin of the Mediterranean in recent years.

But foreign investors did not follow its steps mainly because of administrative problems in the region.

In Rabat, a European Commission statement issued on Friday said the EU had donated $37.5 million to Morocco to improve roads in the north of the country.

It said EU member states approved the donation at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday.

According to figures released by the union, foreign direct investments have stagnated because of lack of adequate financial instruments, modern legislation and business transparency.

Foreign direct investment flows, including equity capital, remained nearly unchanged at around $2.6 billion in the last three years in the 12 southern Mediterranean countries, excluding Libya, the union said.

"This was far below the potentials of the region compared with the east European zone," Pierini said.

Responding to demands by businessmen for the EU to play a major role in boosting private sector investment in south Mediterranean countries, Pierini said:

"The EU message is clear, the problem is not a problem of money and the EU cannot indefinitely provide funds...The southern countries must invest in their future by reviewing the working methods and build an image of confidence abroad."
