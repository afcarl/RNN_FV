<p>The European Union on Friday told a meeting of businessmen it was not an &quot;indefinite funds provider&quot; and south Mediterranean countries needed to modernise their economies to attract foreign investment.</p>
<p>The two-day meeting that started on Thursday in the southern tourist city of Marrakesh drew more than 400 businessmen from 25 Mediterranean and European countries.</p>
<p>&quot;I told the Marrakesh meeting that we are not Santa Claus...The south Mediterranean countries have to work hard to upgrade their economies and modernise the working tools to attract foreign investors,&quot; EU spokesman Marc Pierini told a news conference.</p>
<p>Pierini said EU's European Bank of Investment invested an average 1.0 billion Ecus ($1.2 billion) annually in infrastructure and financial projects mainly in the southern basin of the Mediterranean in recent years.</p>
<p>But foreign investors did not follow its steps mainly because of administrative problems in the region.</p>
<p>In Rabat, a European Commission statement issued on Friday said the EU had donated $37.5 million to Morocco to improve roads in the north of the country.</p>
<p>It said EU member states approved the donation at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday.</p>
<p>According to figures released by the union, foreign direct investments have stagnated because of lack of adequate financial instruments, modern legislation and business transparency.</p>
<p>Foreign direct investment flows, including equity capital, remained nearly unchanged at around $2.6 billion in the last three years in the 12 southern Mediterranean countries, excluding Libya, the union said.</p>
<p>&quot;This was far below the potentials of the region compared with the east European zone,&quot; Pierini said.</p>
<p>Responding to demands by businessmen for the EU to play a major role in boosting private sector investment in south Mediterranean countries, Pierini said:</p>
<p>&quot;The EU message is clear, the problem is not a problem of money and the EU cannot indefinitely provide funds...The southern countries must invest in their future by reviewing the working methods and build an image of confidence abroad.&quot;</p>
