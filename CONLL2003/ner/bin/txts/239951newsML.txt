Turkey's Energy Minister Recai Kutan said on Friday his ministry would soon invite companies to bid for the country's first nuclear power plant, state-run Anatolian news agency reported.

Kutan told Anatolian that the board of state power producer TEAS had approved the opening of a tender for the plant, to be built near the southern coastal village of Akkuyu near Mersin port in southern Turkey.

The plant will be built either as a single unit with a capacity of 1,200 MegaWatts (MW) or two equal units each with a capacity of 600 MW, Kutan was previously quoted as saying.

He had said the cost of the plant would be about $1.5 billion.

French, U.S., Canadian and Japanese firms have shown interest in the plant and are continuing preparatory talks with the Ministry, Kutan told Anatolian.

According to the ministry's programme, construction  could begin late next year if the tender is finalised by July 1997 and it will be completed within six to seven years, the agency said.

Industry analysts said firms interested in the project included France's Framatome Connectors, U.S. ABB Combustion Engineering, Westinghouse Electric Corp, Britain's General Electric Co Plc (GEC), Kvaerner ASA John Brown, Germany's Siemens AG and local bidders.
