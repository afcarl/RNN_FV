<headline>Moroccan bourse resumes pickup.</headline>
<dateline>CASABLANCA 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>The Casablanca bourse closed on Friday 0.27 percent higher than the previous session, maintaining a two-day slight rise after three weeks of steady decline.</p>
<p>The all-share index closed at 433.76 points from 433.24 points last Friday, a rise of 0.12 percent over the week.</p>
<p>Wafabank, a liquid stock, lost 11 dirhams in a week to close at 525 dirhams.</p>
<p>&quot;After a week starting in a downward trend, the bourse has closed on a optimistic note, with a slight increase in the two last days,&quot; said a broker at Casablanca-based Maroc Inter Titres.  </p>
<p>Samir, Morocco's main oil refinery, lost three dirhams to close at 243 dirhams.</p>
<p>The week's best performer was dairy concern Centrale Laitiere, which jumped 45 dirhams to close at 1545 dirhams.</p>
<p>&quot;This increase is the sign that the bourse is expecting rosy annual results since this ONA group subsidiary is being restructured, while 20 percent of its stake has been taken by French Danone,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>ONA group was up 10 dirhams to trade at 485 dirhams.</p>
<p>Societe Nationale d'Investissement, Morocco's second largest private conglomerate, lost 15 dirhams to 535 dirhams after paying a 10 dirhams dividend to shareholders on Friday.</p>
<p>SNI has diversified stakes in more than 40 companies.</p>
<p>Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur, one of the market's largest capitalisation, remained unchanged at 395 dirhams. Traded volume on the official market was 18.4 million from 20.6 million dirhams last Friday.</p>
