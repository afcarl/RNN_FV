The European Union's Middle East envoy said on Friday Israel wanted to resume peace talks with Syria, suspended since March, as soon as possible.

"I think they are open to any kind of formula that could be settled by the two parties," Miguel Angel Moratinos told Reuters before talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara.

Moratinos, who had talks with Israeli officials before arriving in the Syrian capital, said "the message I have from the Israelis is a message of peace...and that they are open to resume the talks as soon as possible."

Moratinos, who is also Spain's ambassador to Israel, said although Israel's position was not new the Jewish state did want to send a message it was not seeking to raise tension.

"They want to get to some specific formula to make the negotiations resume as soon as possible...they have no plan, no action against Syria -- on the opposite they want peace."

Syria and Israel have accused each other of preparing for war. Syria's movement of a third of its 35,000 troops in Lebanon to within striking distance of Israeli forces in September caused war jitters in Israel.

Syria has condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, elected in May, for rejecting the principle of returning occupied Arab land for peace. It said no talks would be held until Netanyahu changed his policy.

Netanyahu this week in Spain was vague on the possibility of territorial compromise on the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Damascus in the 1967 Middle East war.

"I have not ruled out a territorial discussion," Netanyahu told reporters in Madrid.

Syria and Israel have held sporadic peace talks since 1991 but they stalled over the Golan. Syria wants full Israeli withdrawal.

Israel's previous Labour-led government, which broke off talks early in the year after Moslem suicide bombings killed 59 people in Israel, said it was ready for at least a partial pullback in return for full peace.

Moratinos, appointed by the EU in October to help rescue the faltering Arab-Israeli peace process, came to Damascus after meeting Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli officials.

Syria has always sought a greater European role while Israel and the United States, main sponsor of the peace process, were traditionally cool. But Moratinos's appointment was welcomed by Israel as well as the Palestinians.
