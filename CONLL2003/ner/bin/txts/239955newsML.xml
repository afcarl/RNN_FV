<p>Turkey's automotive output totalled 30,560 units in November, a fall of 12 percent compared to a year ago, while car production dived 27 percent to 18,222 over the same period, the automotive industry association (OSD) said on Friday.</p>
<p>It said output rose four percent in the first 11 months of 1996 to 297,923 from 287,612 in the same 1995 period. But car production fell 10 percent to 191,186 units from previous 211,418.</p>
<p>Eleven-month bus output surged 110 percent to 2,183 when compared to the same 1995 period, midibuses rose 62 percent to 5,128, lorries 54 percent to 25,730, tractors 39 percent to 45,843, minibuses 34 percent to 9,118 and pick-ups 23 percent to 18,408.</p>
<p>The OSD said car sales in January-November 1996 rose eight percent to 203,881 units from 188,797, adding that this increase was entirely due to a sharp rise in imported car sales which nearly tripled to 47,012.</p>
<p>Sales of locally produced cars dropped 8.3 percent to 156,869 in the same period.</p>
<p>The OSD said domestic car sales firmed to 17,039 units in November due to campaigns by car makers to enliven weak demand, but was still below the 18,322 cars sold in November 1995.</p>
<p>It said demand was hit by a recent government scheme to allow a limited number of duty-free car imports of up to four years of age from June 1997 by Turkish expatriates and residents who deposited at least 50,000 marks at state banks by end-1996.</p>
