Sultan, emirs, princes and sheikhs at GCC summit.

DUBAI 1996-12-06

Oman's Sultan Qaboos bin Said and Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah will head their delegations to the Gulf Arab summit opening in Doha on Saturday, regional news agencies said on Friday.

Saudi Arabia's 75-year-old King Fahd, who stayed away from last year's summit because of a stroke, will be represented by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, summit organisers said.

Bahrain, in a border dispute and spy row with Qatar, is boycotting the annual meeting hosted by Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifah al-Thani.

No state has previously boycotted the annual meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, formed in 1981 by OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and small oil producers Bahrain and Oman.

Qatar's emir boycotted last year's GCC closing session in Oman and his delegation walked out to protest against the method used to appoint a new GCC secretary-general.

UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid al-Maktoum -- also ruler of the emirate of Dubai -- will head the UAE delegation, the agencies added.

Leaders will tackle a host of issues, including obstacles blocking economic integration.
