<p>Canada's Arakis Energy Corp. ended a year of intense investor speculation on Friday by announcing partners in a consortium that will develop its $1 billion oil project in Sudan.</p>
<p>But Arakis, which aims to develop its 12.2-million acre concession and build a 950-mile pipeline to the Red Sea from southern Sudan, failed to bring a U.S.-based partner on board because of diplomatic tensions between the countries, it said.</p>
<p>Partners in the joint venture include Arakis with 25 percent, China National Petroleum Corp. with 40 percent, Malaysia state-owned oil company Petronas Caligali with 30 percent and the Sudan government with 5 percent.</p>
<p>Arakis, which will continue to operate the project, had earlier said it hoped for 40 percent to 50 percent.</p>
<p>The consortium plans to initially transport 150,000 barrels of oil per day to export markets by 1999. The company has said it was comfortable with oil reserve estimates of 600 million barrels, although analysts have said the fields could harbour many times that.</p>
<p>Arakis Chief Executive John McLeod said in an interview that political tension between civil war-torn Sudan and the United States was the main reason behind the potential U.S. partner, which was widely seen to be Occidental Petroleum Corp., being absent from the final roster of international players.</p>
<p>&quot;In the end, politics won,&quot; McLeod said.</p>
<p>An executive order signed recently by President Clinton to halt the granting of visas to Sudanese officials wanting to enter the United States came at a crucial time in the intense negotiations, he said.</p>
<p>United States government sources said Friday that they believed the visa move, and news in early November that the United States was sending $20 million in military aid to neighbouring states in what was alleged to be indirect support of Sudanese rebels, convinced the Khartoum government to force Occidental out of the discussions.</p>
<p>The United States has denied the aid was for assisting groups aiming to topple Sudan's Islamic government.</p>
<p>Occidental declined comment on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Pushed, walked, shoved, the government was not going to approve them as a consortium partner,&quot; McLeod said.</p>
<p>Arakis has often received threats from the Sudan People Liberation Army, a rebel group fighting for greater independence for Sudan's mainly Christian and animist south from the Moslem north.</p>
<p>Arakis has tried for a year to set up a conventional industry joint venture for the project after a much-publicised financing deal collapsed in 1995, sending its shares into a tailspin and forcing out previous management.</p>
<p>Under the deal announced Friday, Arakis will get financial recognition for the money it has already spent developing the fields over the last two years, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't really have cash requirements for a significant period of time. The key thing here is that this consortium has the financial capacity to make this pipeline happen and they are committed to go ahead with the pipeline,&quot; McLeod said.</p>
<p>A roster without U.S. participation may have averted future negative political ramifications amid increasingly tense relations between Sudan and the United States, which earlier this year placed the African country on a list of sanctioned nations accused of supporting terrorism.</p>
<p>Following a wild ride upward and downward Friday, Arakis shares on Nasdaq closed unchaged at $5.56, with 12.1 million shares changing hands.</p>
