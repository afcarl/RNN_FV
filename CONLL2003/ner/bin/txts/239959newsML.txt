Airlines see British demands on deal as a "start".

British regulators Friday set conditions on the approval of the proposed British Airways Plc and American Airlines alliance, and though the two carriers did not reject the conditions outright, other U.S. airlines called the demands merely a "step in the right direction."

British Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang said that even if the conditions were met by both airlines, final clearance would hinge on an so-called open skies deal between Britain and the United States to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic, which would create greater competition on the routes.

However, the latest set of open skies talks ended in London Friday without agreement, and industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks.

They blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British Airways-American deal would be cleared.

The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British Airways and American drop 168 slots a week at London's Heathrow airport, reduce services on the London-to-Dallas/Fort Worth route, and lose some slots on the London-to-Boston route. British Airways also would be required to drop a clause in its pact with USAir Group Inc. that prevents USAir from competing on transatlantic routes.

American's parent, AMR Corp., said it did not view the terms as a "deal breaker." However, it called the conditions "more severe" than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances.

American Chairman Robert Crandall said in a statement that "excessive restrictions" would jeopardise the economics of the alliance and endanger the prospects for new Anglo-U.S. "Open Skies" air treaty.

British Airways said slot transfers would be "unprecedented," but said the carrier could take "reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition."

The conditions "seem like somewhat less than what competitors have asked for," said Candace Browning, an airline analyst with Merrill Lynch. "It doesn't seem that these demands would kill the deal. It's not such an unreasonble request," she said.

United Airlines said the conditions "fall short of what we believe is necessary to ensure a competitive balance at Heathrow," but called the terms a "step in the right direction" toward expanding competition.

Delta Air Lines Inc. said it remained opposed to the proposed British Airways-American deal, regardless of how many concessions were made.

Delta insisted that requiring the two to give up as many as 525 slots would be "woefully inadequate since Heathrow lacks room for additional support services, airplane parking and gates."

Delta said London Heathrow airport cannot grow enough to support competitive services.

"We don't see any scenario under which capacity could grow enough to support competition," said Delta spokesman Dean Breest.

Continental Airlines Inc. said it was pleased that British regulators supported its claim that the proposed union raises some anti-competition concerns.
