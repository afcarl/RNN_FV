<p>CIA Director John Deutch has upheld a decision to punish a top State Department official who disclosed that a paid CIA informant may have been involved in murders in Guatemala, a U.S. official said on Friday.</p>
<p>Deutch, whose replacement President Bill Clinton announced on Thursday, let stand a three-member review panel's recommendation that the official, Richard Nuccio, be stripped of his access to data classified as &quot;sensitive-compartmented information,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>But Deutch ruled that Nuccio, a former special adviser to Clinton on Cuba and a one-time special envoy to Guatemala, could reapply for his clearance in a year.</p>
<p>Nuccio has acknowledged publicly that he told a member of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee that a Guatemalan officer on the CIA payroll, Julio Roberto Alpirez, was implicated in the murder of a U.S. citizen and in the death of a local guerrilla leader married to an American.</p>
<p>The disclosures led Clinton in March 1995, to order a review of Central Intelligence Agency activities in Guatemala. Deutch later fired two CIA officers in the directorate of operations for failing to keep Congress &quot;fully and currently informed&quot; of covert operations, as required by a 1980 law.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview with Reuters Friday, Nuccio said he would fight Deutch's action that he said was a challenge to Congress's and the American people's right to be informed of CIA misdeeds.</p>
<p>&quot;This is about whether the CIA is above the law and beyond the Constitution,&quot; he said. &quot;It's an assertion by the agency that they can use secrecy in their control of classification to prevent the Congress from learning about their own illegal activities.&quot;</p>
<p>Nuccio said he had not yet made up his mind about whether he would stay at the State Department. He said he was considering a range of options which he did not spell out.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry described Nuccio's punishment &quot;a painful decision&quot; but that &quot;at the same time all of us in a position to receive sensitive classified material know the obligations that go with that responsibility.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We at the White House know him, respect him, (and) hope that after the one-year period in which he does not have access to this information he will see his own career advance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked if Americans had a right to know the facts surrounding the case, McCurry said &quot;absolutely,&quot; but that proper procedures existed for getting the information out.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the department agreed to the review procedure Deutch employed and would abide by the decisions. But he also said Nuccio &quot;will continue to be employed by the Department of State as long as he wishes to be.&quot;</p>
<p>While Deutch's decision deprives Nuccio of certain specified high-level security clearance, he will maintain other security clearances at the State Department, Burns said.</p>
<p>Without elaborating, Burns said Nuccio, a senior adviser to the assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, would have to work on &quot;other issues&quot; if he stayed at the department. Burns said he did not know what Nuccio's decision would be.</p>
<p>Nuccio claimed in an unusual airing of his story on the CBS programme &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that he was being &quot;hounded out of government service&quot; by the CIA.</p>
<p>He said he blew the whistle in a crisis of conscience because the CIA had failed to brief Congress on the Alpirez matter, as required by law, and he himself had unknowingly given Congress false information based on this stonewalling.</p>
<p>The CIA declined to discuss Deutch's action, citing privacy rights of Nuccio, who has said losing his clearance would amount to making it impossible for him to do his State Department job.</p>
