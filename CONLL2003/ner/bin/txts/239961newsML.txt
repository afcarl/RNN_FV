Clinton urges companies hire people off welfare.

President Clinton Friday urged businesses to consider instituting programmes to hire disadvantaged people from welfare rolls without getting government subsidies for the hires.

"We cannot do it unless the private sector is a partner," he said.

During his re-election campaign, Clinton proposed initiatives to give employers $3.43 billion in tax credits for making welfare hires and give states and local authorities $3 billion to work with the private sector and non-profit agencies to create job opportunities.

But in a speech to business leaders, Clinton said government subsidies alone would not solve the welfare-to-work problem, which Washington hopes to tackle with a controversial welfare law Clinton signed last August.

The law requires welfare recipients to begin working two years after receiving welfare and mandates that 50 percent of single-parent families work 30 hours a week by 2002.

He said each state should be willing to give checks to employers as job subsidies to move more people from welfare to work.

The president has taken heat from fellow Democrats for signing the Republican-backed welfare law. He and White House aides are currently discussing ways to amend it in order to protect child nutrition and benefits for legal immigrants.

Whether the Republican majority in Congress will go along with any amendments is in doubt.

Clinton spoke at the annual awarding of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, the highest honour awarded to U.S. companies by the president for performance and business excellence.

Winners this year were ADAC Laboratories of Milpitas, Calif., in the manufacturing category; Dana Commercial Credit Corp of Toledo, Ohio, in the service category; Custom Research Inc., of Minneapolis, Minn., in the small business category; and Trident Precision Manufacturing Inc., of Webster, N.Y., in the small business category.
