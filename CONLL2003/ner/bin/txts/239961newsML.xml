<p>President Clinton Friday urged businesses to consider instituting programmes to hire disadvantaged people from welfare rolls without getting government subsidies for the hires.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot do it unless the private sector is a partner,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>During his re-election campaign, Clinton proposed initiatives to give employers $3.43 billion in tax credits for making welfare hires and give states and local authorities $3 billion to work with the private sector and non-profit agencies to create job opportunities.</p>
<p>But in a speech to business leaders, Clinton said government subsidies alone would not solve the welfare-to-work problem, which Washington hopes to tackle with a controversial welfare law Clinton signed last August.</p>
<p>The law requires welfare recipients to begin working two years after receiving welfare and mandates that 50 percent of single-parent families work 30 hours a week by 2002.</p>
<p>He said each state should be willing to give checks to employers as job subsidies to move more people from welfare to work.</p>
<p>The president has taken heat from fellow Democrats for signing the Republican-backed welfare law. He and White House aides are currently discussing ways to amend it in order to protect child nutrition and benefits for legal immigrants.</p>
<p>Whether the Republican majority in Congress will go along with any amendments is in doubt.</p>
<p>Clinton spoke at the annual awarding of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, the highest honour awarded to U.S. companies by the president for performance and business excellence.</p>
<p>Winners this year were ADAC Laboratories of Milpitas, Calif., in the manufacturing category; Dana Commercial Credit Corp of Toledo, Ohio, in the service category; Custom Research Inc., of Minneapolis, Minn., in the small business category; and Trident Precision Manufacturing Inc., of Webster, N.Y., in the small business category.</p>
