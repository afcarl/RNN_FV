Greenspan sparks plunge in financial markets.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Stocks took their biggest nosedive since July and bonds tumbled Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned about "irrational exuberance" infecting financial markets.

The comments were taken as a hint that the central bank might boost interest rates to cool things down, and sparked a wave of selling in stock markets around the world.

Financial markets recouped much of their losses, however, after a surprisingly weak U.S. payrolls report calmed worries about an interest rate hike.

The shake-up also rattled U.S. commodity markets with cattle, corn, soybeans and lumber futures ending lower. Gold and silver markets gyrated sharply before closing weaker.

"Greenspan startled people and what you got was an emotional reaction," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 144 points soon after the stock market opened, but clawed its way back to end off 55.16, or 0.86 percent, at 6,381.94. It was the blue-chip index's biggest point drop since July 15 when it slumped 161.05 points amid worries about corporate earnings.

For the week, the Dow was off 139.76 points, its first negative week since late October.

In the broader market, losers overwhelmed gainers by a margin of 20 to five on heavy volume of 505 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Nasdaq Composite index slid 12.44 to 1,287.68, after tumbling more than 41 points earlier.

The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell more than one full point, before trimming losses to end just 2/32 lower. The yield, which had jumped to 6.54 percent, ended unchanged at 6.51 percent.

The U.S. markets were the last to feel the shock of Greenspan's comments, which came late Thursday when Asian markets were open.

In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 share index fell 667 points, or 3.2 percent, to 20,277, down 743.66 for the week. London's FTSE-100 slumped 88.2 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,963, down 95.0 from last Friday.

"In another market, his comments would have been ignored but he made them at a time when the market was extraordinarily vulnerable," said Gary Anderson of Anderson & Loe, a firm that advises money managers.

"The army of of bulls, which had been on a blitzkrieg ... just suddenly ran into machine gun fire," Anderson said.

The dollar fell to lows of 1.5280 German marks and 111.73 Japanese yen in European trade. But by the end of the day, it had recovered to 1.5465 marks, only modestly lower than 1.5498 late Thursday. The dollar rose to 112.88 yen from 112.33 yen.

February gold ended down $2.20 at $370.80 an ounce on the New York Commodity Exchange. COMEX March silver closed down 8.7 cents at $4.805.

Speaking in Washington late Thursday, Greenspan stunned world markets with a comment that Fed officials "need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy, its production, jobs and price stability."

Greenspan said the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets. He also rekindled concern about interest rates by alluding to the need for the Fed to anticipate inflation because of the lagging effect of rate changes on the economy.

Greenspan's comments hit markets that were already keenly sensitive about inflation risks, sparking massive selling in Asian and European stocks and bonds.

The market's worst fears were allayed, however, when the Labour Department reported early Friday that U.S. unemployment rose to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent.

"If we had had this (Greenspan) speech and the unemployment rate had gone below 5 percent, the market would be in serious trouble," Hale said.

Concerns about an economic slowdown weighed on live cattle futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on the feeling that consumers would buy fewer high-priced steaks and roasts.

CME December live cattle futures closed down 1 cent at 65.425 cents per pound, the lowest close in 4-1/2 months.

At the Chicago Board of Trade, December corn closed down 1-1/4 cents at $2.67-1/4 per bushel and January soybeans were off 6 cents at $6.96 per bushel.

CME January lumber was down $6.10 at $409.30 per 1,000 board feet.
