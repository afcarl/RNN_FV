Wall Street stocks sank Friday as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning over "irrational exuberance" was seen as a hint that the central bank may boost interest rates to cool things down.

The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 55.16 points at 6,381.94 after rebounding from a loss of more than 144 points, which was the blue-chip index's biggest point drop since July 15 when it tumbled 161.05 points on worries about corporate earnings.

For the week, the Dow was off 139.76 points, its first negative week since late October.

In the broader market, declining issues swamped advances 2,078 to 548 on heavy volume of 500 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.

"Greenspan tried to put cold water on the parade here," said Harvey Hirschhorn, chief economist and investment strategist at Stein Roe. "He was trying to temper the enthusiasm in the marketplace."

In a speech Thursday night, the central bank chairman said the Fed must be wary of "irrational exuberance" in stock and other asset markets because that could end up hurting the economy.

While he stopped short of commenting directly on recent stock market action, his remarks suggested that he was concerned and the comments were taken that way by Wall Street.

Greenspan's comments shook up traders, who feared he was suggesting the possibility of higher interest rates.

"People are reading what he said as ... the chairman believes there is excessive speculation in the marketplace today ... and therefore, the Fed may move toward (monetary) tightening," said Eugene Sit, chairman of Sit Mutual Funds.

Some analysts expressed surprise at the Fed chairman's comments.

"In all of my career I can't remember a chairman of the Federal Reserve doing this kind of jawboning at the stock market," said George Salem, a bank analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison. "And it was rather heavy-handed, it wasn't subtle."

The bond markets was also rattled.

The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell more than one full point, before trimming losses to trade 2/32 lower. The yield rose as high as 6.54 percent -- the highest since Nov. 7 -- before ending even with Thursday's close of 6.51 percent.

Analysts said bonds benefited from a surprisingly weak payrolls report, which calmed worries that strong economic growth and a pickup in inflation would force the Fed to raise interest rates.

"The overall payroll data indicated that economic growth is moderate, and employment gains were weaker than expected," said Hirschhorn.

Instead of the 179,000 new jobs that Wall Street had predicted, the economy created just 118,000 new jobs during the month.

The unemployment rate rose as well, climbing to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent in October. Average hourly wages rose by nine cents.

Some strategists said that the sharp market reaction to Greenspan's comments reflected a deeper fear that stocks were reaching unsupportable highs.

"There's sort of a disguised bearish sentiment in the market," said Peggy Farley, managing director of Amas Securities.

"The feeling is there's no reason for it to go up," she said. "People are afraid there's going to be a correction."

Among the winners, Citicorp ended up 1-7/8 to 103-1/2 and Chase Manhattan added 1/2 to 89-3/8.

Philip Morris posted a third straight day of gains, closing up 1-1/2 to 109-1/2 as analysts reckoned that the disposition of various tobacco lawsuits would be favourable to tobacco companies.

Advanced Micro Devices rose 2-1/2 to 26-1/8. Cowen & Co upgraded its opinion of the stock.

The Nasdaq Composite index slid 12.44 points to 1,287.68.

The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 4.78 to 739.60. The American Stock Exchange index was off 4.33 to 585.70.

The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks lost 2.60 to 390.15. The average share was down 27 cents.

The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 7,168.444 down 50.755 or 0.70 percent.
