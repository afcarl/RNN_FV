<headline>Stock prices skid on Greenspan's market warning.</headline>

<p>Wall Street stocks sank Friday as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning over &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; was seen as a hint that the central bank may boost interest rates to cool things down.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 55.16 points at 6,381.94 after rebounding from a loss of more than 144 points, which was the blue-chip index's biggest point drop since July 15 when it tumbled 161.05 points on worries about corporate earnings.</p>
<p>For the week, the Dow was off 139.76 points, its first negative week since late October.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues swamped advances 2,078 to 548 on heavy volume of 500 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan tried to put cold water on the parade here,&quot; said Harvey Hirschhorn, chief economist and investment strategist at Stein Roe. &quot;He was trying to temper the enthusiasm in the marketplace.&quot;</p>
<p>In a speech Thursday night, the central bank chairman said the Fed must be wary of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in stock and other asset markets because that could end up hurting the economy.</p>
<p>While he stopped short of commenting directly on recent stock market action, his remarks suggested that he was concerned and the comments were taken that way by Wall Street.</p>
<p>Greenspan's comments shook up traders, who feared he was suggesting the possibility of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;People are reading what he said as ... the chairman believes there is excessive speculation in the marketplace today ... and therefore, the Fed may move toward (monetary) tightening,&quot; said Eugene Sit, chairman of Sit Mutual Funds.</p>
<p>Some analysts expressed surprise at the Fed chairman's comments.</p>
<p>&quot;In all of my career I can't remember a chairman of the Federal Reserve doing this kind of jawboning at the stock market,&quot; said George Salem, a bank analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison. &quot;And it was rather heavy-handed, it wasn't subtle.&quot;</p>
<p>The bond markets was also rattled.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell more than one full point, before trimming losses to trade 2/32 lower. The yield rose as high as 6.54 percent -- the highest since Nov. 7 -- before ending even with Thursday's close of 6.51 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said bonds benefited from a surprisingly weak payrolls report, which calmed worries that strong economic growth and a pickup in inflation would force the Fed to raise interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The overall payroll data indicated that economic growth is moderate, and employment gains were weaker than expected,&quot; said Hirschhorn.</p>
<p>Instead of the 179,000 new jobs that Wall Street had predicted, the economy created just 118,000 new jobs during the month.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate rose as well, climbing to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent in October. Average hourly wages rose by nine cents.</p>
<p>Some strategists said that the sharp market reaction to Greenspan's comments reflected a deeper fear that stocks were reaching unsupportable highs.</p>
<p>&quot;There's sort of a disguised bearish sentiment in the market,&quot; said Peggy Farley, managing director of Amas Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The feeling is there's no reason for it to go up,&quot; she said. &quot;People are afraid there's going to be a correction.&quot;</p>
<p>Among the winners, Citicorp ended up 1-7/8 to 103-1/2 and Chase Manhattan added 1/2 to 89-3/8.</p>
<p>Philip Morris posted a third straight day of gains, closing up 1-1/2 to 109-1/2 as analysts reckoned that the disposition of various tobacco lawsuits would be favourable to tobacco companies.</p>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices rose 2-1/2 to 26-1/8. Cowen &amp; Co upgraded its opinion of the stock.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index slid 12.44 points to 1,287.68.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 4.78 to 739.60. The American Stock Exchange index was off 4.33 to 585.70.</p>
<p>The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks lost 2.60 to 390.15. The average share was down 27 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 7,168.444 down 50.755 or 0.70 percent.</p>
