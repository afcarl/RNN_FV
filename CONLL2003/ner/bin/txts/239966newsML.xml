<p>A federal judge on Friday temporarily barred the University of California from implementing an anti-affirmative action measure.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson granted a request by civil rights groups to issue a temporary restraining order barring the nine-campus university from implementing the controversial measure passed by California voters on Nov. 5.</p>
<p>The measure, called Proposition 209, bars discrimination and preferential treatment based on race or sex in public employment, education and contracting in California, effectively outlawing public affirmative action programmes used to broaden opportunities for minorities and women.</p>
<p>The university is bound by the order at least until Dec. 16, when Henderson will hold a court hearing to decide whether to issue a preliminary order blocking the state from implementing the anti-affirmative action measure until a trial is held on its constitutionality.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups filed suit seeking to block the measure, arguing that it is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The passage of Proposition 209 had an instant impact on the University of California, which ordered that race and sex be dropped immediately as factors in deciding which students won admission or financial aid.</p>
<p>The civil rights groups sought the temporary restraining order because they were concerned that the school might make decisions on undergraduate admissions and financial aid that would be affected by Proposition 209 before Dec. 16.</p>
<p>Henderson issued a temporary restraining order last week barring California Gov. Pete Wilson and state Attorney General Dan Lungren from implementing the proposition, saying there was a strong probability that it would be found unconstitutional. But that order technically did not bind state agencies or the University of California.</p>
