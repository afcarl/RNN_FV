<p>The United States on Friday kept the pressure on Serbia to move toward democracy, demanding that Belgrade open a dialogue with political opponents who have staged 18 days of mass demonstrations.</p>
<p>Belgrade has moved toward the opposition in recent days but &quot;the United States believes that the Serbian government should now go a further step ... (and) initiate an open dialogue with the opposition in Serbia,&quot; State Department spokesman Nichols Burns told reporters.</p>
<p>He said it was &quot;not enough for&quot; Serbia to allow the main independent radio station B-92 to resume broadcasting and &quot;to think about reversing&quot; its decision to overturn a local election the opposition claims it won on Nov. 17. &quot;This is no time for business as usual on Serbia. This is a time for the democratic process to move forward in Serbia,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Officials said they believe the protests had made this possible.</p>
<p>Burns noted that the Belgrade Electoral Commission filed an official appeal with the Serbian Supreme Court and with the republic prosecutor to reconsider the decision by the government of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to annul the results of the Nov. 17 municipal elections.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States believes that the Milosevic government should now take the step of reversing its decision.  It should now take a solid step of respecting the municipal elections of Nov. 17,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There are preliminary indications that the government might be willing to consider this but &quot;we will remain more impressed by actions than we are by words,&quot; Burns said.</p>
<p>He pressed Belgrade further, asserting: &quot;The opposition should be allowed to participate in the political life of the country. The opposition is freely now participating on the streets of the country. It should be let into the halls of power. It should be let into the government offices.&quot;</p>
<p>He specifically called for &quot;a dialogue ... to consider the future of Serbia (which) we believe ... should be democratic.&quot;</p>
<p>He denied Washington was interfering in Serbia's internal affairs but claimed credit for the United States in &quot;forcing&quot; Serbia to let B-92 and another radio station operate.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it's (the U.S. role) been seen as interference by some thugs in the government in Belgrade. But it's certainly not been seen as interference by the democrats on the streets of Belgrade.... It is entirely appropriate for the United States to stand up for democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the media,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The United States was slow to react when the opposition demonstrations began. But despite Milosevic's key role in the U.S.-negotiated Bosnia peace agreement, Washington increasingly has taken the side of the protestors.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, the administration warned Belgrade against using force against the protesters and made it possible for the two radio stations to circumvent a short-lived government effort to silence them.</p>
<p>Serbia's opposition sensed possible victory in their campaign against socialist election fraud when the Belgrade election commission asked the supreme court on Thursday to review disputed results. The move followed signals that Milosevic had ordered steps to appease students and supporters of the opposition Zajedno coalition who have harassed the ruling socialists with 18 days of mass demonstrations.</p>
<p>A record 150,000-strong crowd staged a protest in the capital on Friday and 25,000 mustered in the southern town of Nis.</p>
