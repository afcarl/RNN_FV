Advanced Micro Devices stock up.

NEW YORK

The stock of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. rose in heavy trading Friday, a day after the semiconductor maker said it will cut about 250 jobs from its worldwide staff of 12,400.

The stock rose $2.375 to $25.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was among the most active issues.

The company said the action was needed to "reduce its fundamental cost structure and to align skill sets with anticipated future needs."

The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company will take a charge of "up to $8 million," to cover the costs of providing benefits to the employees being laid off.

Cowen & Co. recommended buying the stock, which it previously rated as neutral.
