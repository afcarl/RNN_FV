Fidelity U.S. funds having worst year since 1980.

The domestic stock mutual funds of Fidelity Investments are having their worst year compared with competitors since 1980, a firm that tracks mutual fund performance said Friday.

Fueled by some of the top stock pickers in the industry and supported by a massive research team, Fidelity's average U.S. stock fund had beaten its peers every year from 1981 to 1995, according to Morningstar Inc.

But during the first 11 months this year, the giant mutual fund company's U.S. stock funds rose an average of 18.7 percent vs. 20.2 percent for the average diversified domestic stock fund, Morningstar said. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 25.2 percent over the same time period.

"They'll be happy to put this year in their rear-view mirror, that's for sure," said Russell Kinnell, an analyst at Morningstar. "Fidelity traditionally has one of the very best records. This year they've run into trouble on a number of fronts."

Scott Beyerl, a Fidelity spokesman, said 1996 has been a year where large capitalization stocks, those companies with shares valued in the billions of dollars, have outperformed smaller stocks.

"Traditionally, our managers have had a bias towards small and mid-cap stocks," he said, adding that Fidelity's long-term performance has been "excellent".

Some of Fidelity's largest funds have had the worst returns.

The $53 billion Magellan Fund is up just 12.9 percent year-to-date. The $18 billion Puritan Fund has returned 14.9 percent, the $6.9 billion Value Fund 17.9 percent, and the $4.0 billion Retirement Fund 9.0 percent.

The one-year results may have only a marginal impact on investors' portfolios in the long run. But the sub-par results may have contributed to the heavy number of fund managers that left Fidelity this year and to Fidelity's declining share of mutual fund assets, analysts said.

More than 10 fund managers and other investment professionals have left Fidelity this year, including such well-known names as Jeffrey Vinik, Robert Beckwitt, Michael Gordon and Brian Posner, who left earlier this week.

"It's a brain drain," said David O'Leary, president of Portsmouth, N.H.-based Alpha Equity Research. "All year long they've been losing their bench, and now they are losing their first team."

Beyerl said the bull market in stocks was creating enticing opportunities for Fidelity investment professionals at other companies.

Remy Trefelet, who managed Fidelity Select Regional Banks Portfolio until September, said his departure to become a partner in Kramer Spellman Ltd. Partners in Fort Lee, N.J., was "an opportunity I just couldn't pass up."

"It's not as disruptive as it seems on the outside," he said of this year's moves. "The bench is unbelievably deep there. Fidelity is built for that. It's built for change."

Alpha Equity's O'Leary traced Fidelity's performance problems back to August 1995, when the funds, led by the flagship Magellan, began selling its huge stake in technology shares.

Expecting a market correction, many of the funds trimmed their holdings in growth stocks and bought more conservative shares or invested in bonds and cash, O'Leary said.

But the stock market marched to record highs this year, leaving Fidelity behind.

"Certainly, the asset allocation decisions on some of the funds negatively affected performance earlier this year," Fidelity's Beyerl said. "But I think that the market environment has played a large part in the story as well."
