<headline>Greenspan wants to deflate, not burst stock bubble.</headline>

<p>By Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan could hardly have had more of an immediate impact on the world's skittish financial markets than if he had raised interest rates.</p>
<p>By hinting that buoyant U.S. stock prices may be overheated, Greenspan triggered a worldwide rush to sell stocks, bonds and the dollar on fears that the high-flying markets were headed for a crash.</p>
<p>But analysts said the central bank chief -- arguably the most powerful financial official in the world -- was not out to burst the stock-price bubble, just deflate it a bit. Greenspan was unlikely to raise interest rates soon, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan wanted to take some of the air out of the stock market balloon,&quot; said David Jones, vice chairman of brokerage Aubrey G. Lanston and Co. &quot;In no way did I sense that he was threatening to tighten, though he clearly was jawboning.&quot;</p>
<p>His timing, in some sense, could not have been better. Blue-chip stocks, which have jumped about 25 percent this year, had shown signs of running out of steam this week as investors cashed in some profits.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 140 points after Greenspan's comments, but then the market stabilised. It ended down 55 points at 6,381.95, for a 0.86 percent decline.</p>
<p>The early drop on Wall Street followed steep sell-offs overnight in major markets from Tokyo to London.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the Fed raising rates would have triggered as much a reaction in Asia as this did,&quot; said Cynthia Latta, of Massachusetts-based consultants DRI/McGraw Hill.</p>
<p>In his speech on Thursday, Greenspan said the Fed must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stock and other asset markets because that could end up hurting the economy.</p>
<p>While he stopped short of commenting directly on recent stock market action, his remarks suggested that he was concerned -- and were taken that way by Wall Street.</p>
<p>But it was not clear what the Fed chief could do, other than talking, if he indeed felt stock prices were too high and headed for a crash that could hurt the economy.</p>
<p>If the central bank raised interest rates to try to cool off speculative fervor, it would risk triggering the very stock market meltdown it was seeking to avoid, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Fed holds its next policy-making meeting on Dec. 17 and was widely expected to hold interest rates steady amid signs of moderate economic growth with steady inflation.</p>
<p>That feeling was reinforced by news Friday that the unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent last month, from 5.2 percent in October, as the number of new jobs created fell to 118,000 from 224,000.</p>
<p>Analysts said the jobs report helped quiet fears that a tight labour market would push up wages, forcing the central bank to raise short-term rates in a bid to ward off inflation.</p>
<p>Greenspan himself said on Thursday that inflation has been low, but added that its &quot;future course remains uncertain.&quot;</p>
<p>Some Fed officials privately admitted they would feel more comfortable if stock prices were somewhat lower. But they showed no signs of wanting to do anything about it.</p>
<p>In fact, Fed officials' public comments about the generally rosy outlook for the economy have if anything contributed to the euphoria on Wall Street.</p>
<p>&quot;There is every reason why the market should be exuberant,&quot; said James Glassman, senior economist at Chase Securities, noting the Fed has signalled it felt that inflation was under control and the economy was sound.</p>
<p>In trying to come to terms with the stock market, the Fed faces something of a dilemma. Higher stock prices are good for the economy because investors feel -- and at least on paper are -- richer and spend more.</p>
<p>The danger is that if prices run up too high too fast, that could lead to a collapse that would ripple through the economy. A sudden sell-off could push brokers into bankruptcy, sap consumer confidence and possibly even drive the economy into recession.</p>
<p>That was exactly what was feared would happen after the crash on Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones index plunged by 508 points.</p>
<p>Greenspan was influential in containing the economic fall-out from that collapse by promising to provide the financial system with liquidity if needed.</p>
<p>&quot;We as central bankers need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy, its production, jobs and price stability,&quot; Greenspan said Thursday. &quot;Indeed, the sharp stock market break of 1987 had few negative consequences for the economy.&quot;</p>
