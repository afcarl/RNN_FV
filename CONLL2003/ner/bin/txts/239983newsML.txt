Northeast responds to agency nuclear report.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Northeast Utilities (NU) said a report on its nuclear facilities from the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) did not take into account significant changes made by the company.

NU said the report, among other things, did not consider the hiring of Bruce Kenyon as chief executive and president of subsidiary NU Nuclear or the hiring of David Goebel to head the company's department of nuclear oversight.

The DPUC report, released Dec 6, said NU lacked leadership and planning in administration of its four Connecticut nuclear power plants.
