Stocks, bonds, dollar fall on Greenspan's comments.

Stocks took their biggest nosedive since July and bonds tumbled Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned about "irrational exuberance" infecting financial markets.

"Greenspan startled people and what you got was an emotional reaction," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial.

Greenspan's comments sparked a wave of selling in stock markets around the world.

Financial markets recouped some of their losses, however, after a surprisingly weak U.S. payrolls report calmed worries that strong economic growth and a pickup in inflation would force the Fed to raise interest rates.

Gold, which rallied as investors sought safe havens amid the market sell-off, recovered as Wall Street's jitters eased.

The Dow Jones industrial average pulled back from its worst loss of more than 140 points soon after the stock market opened. At 1:30 p.m. EST, the index was off 48.07, or 0.75 percent, at 6,689.03. It was the blue chip index's biggest point drop since July 15 when it slumped 161.05 points amid worries about corporate earnings.

In the broader market, losers overwhelmed gainers by a margin of 22 to three on volume of 327 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Nasdaq Composite index slid 15.42 to 1,284.70, after tumbling more than 41 points earlier.

The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell more than one full point, before trimming losses to trade 13/32 lower. The yield rose to 6.54 percent -- the highest since Nov. 7 -- from 6.51 percent at Thursday's close.

The U.S. markets were the last to feel the shock of Greenspan's comments, which came late Thursday when Asian markets were open. In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 share index fell 667 points, or 3.2 percent, to 20,277. London's FTSE-100 slumped 88.2 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,963.

"In another market, his comments would have been ignored but he made them at a time when the market was extraordinarily vulnerable," said Gary Anderson of Anderson & Loe, a firm that advises money managers.

"The army of of bulls, which had been on a blitzkrieg ... just suddenly ran into machine gun fire," Anderson said.

Against the German mark, the dollar lost more than two pfennigs after Greenspan's speech, but recovered slightly after the payroll report came out at 8:30 a.m. EST.

The dollar fell to 1.5455 marks from 1.5512 marks late Thursday. But it rose to 112.80 Japanese yen from 112.33 yen.

February gold slid $1.70 to $371.30 an ounce at New York's Commodity Exchange, after soaring to $373 in London markets.

Speaking in Washington late Thursday, Greenspan stunned world markets with a comment that Fed officials "need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy, its production, jobs and price stability."

Greenspan said the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets. He also rekindled concern about interest rates by alluding to the need for the Fed to anticipate inflation because of the lagging effect of rate changes on the economy.

Greenspan's comments hit markets that were already keenly sensitive about inflation risks, sparking massive selling in Asian and European stocks and bonds.

The market's worst fears were allayed, however, when the Labour Department reported early Friday that U.S. unemployment rose to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent.

"If we had had this (Greenspan) speech and the unemployment rate had gone below 5 percent, the market would be in serious trouble," Hale said.

Average hourly earnings rose 0.8 percent in November, but officials played down the rise, labeling it "erratic."

"Certainly the report took some of the pressure off. It snatched us from the jaws of doom," said Kevin Lawrie, global foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank.

New York stocks have soared 25 percent this year and major European stock markets have hit peaks in the last few weeks, leading some analysts to worry that market may be heading for a crash.

"I think what happened is Greenspan is trying to talk the market down," said Hildegard Zagorski, market analyst at Prudential Securities.
