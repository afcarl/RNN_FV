<title>USA: New trial ordered for accused Connecticut rapist.</title>
<headline>New trial ordered for accused Connecticut rapist.</headline>
<dateline>STAMFORD, Conn. 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Connecticut judge Friday ordered a new trial for Alex Kelly, a man accused of raping a 16-year-old girl in 1986 who then fled to Europe where he hid from authorities for eight years.</p>
<p>Kelly, 29, was in Stamford Superior Court accompanied by his parents and attorney Thomas Puccio for the 20-minute hearing following last month's mistrial.</p>
<p>Puccio argued with Judge Martin Nigro that his client's $1 million bond terms should be changed, arguing that Kelly would like to return to classes and was interested in coaching youth sports at an inner-city education programme.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand some of the difficulties he had in the past, but in light of the hung jury these restrictions are simply here to make sure the defendant appears. In light of the hung jury he is less likely to be an appearance problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But prosecutor Bruce Hudock argued strenuously against a change in the bond conditions, which require Kelly to wear an electronic bracelet and to leave home only under his parents' supervision. &quot;He is closer to conviction than ever before,&quot; Hudock said.</p>
<p>Nigro, in setting a new date for trial of April 7, said he would consider any suitable restrictions the defence proposed. The judge also set Jan. 15 as the date for pre-trial motions.</p>
<p>The alleged rape of the 16-year-old girl occurred in 1986. He fled to Europe where he evaded authorities for eight years. Kelly also faces other charges from 1986, including a rape charge by a girl who was 17 at the time.</p>
