<p>Space shuttle Columbia's crew of five, which includes NASA's oldest astronaut, orbited into the record books on Friday after their homecoming was postponed for a second consecutive day.</p>
<p>Thick fog blanketed the shuttle's runway at Kennedy Space Centre and forced NASA to call off two planned landing attempts on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Flight controllers briefly considered diverting Columbia to a backup landing site at Edwards Air Force Base in California's Mojave desert, but winds gusting as high as 29 knots posed too much of a safety risk there.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got Story (Musgrave) up there and now we can't get him back,&quot; mission control's Curt Brown joked when he radioed the news of the postponement to the crew. Musgrave, at 61 the oldest person to fly in space, is making his sixth and final shuttle flight.</p>
<p>&quot;You make the most of every hand you get dealt,&quot; the veteran astronaut replied.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we're going to use jokers tomorrow so we're going to bring you home,&quot; Brown responded wryly.</p>
<p>The shuttle's extra day in orbit allowed it to break the record for the longest shuttle mission, surpassing the previous record at 12:45 p.m. EST (1745 GMT) on Friday. By its scheduled landing on Saturday, it would have broken the record by more than 18 hours. The current record was set by a different crew aboard Columbia last July, when the orbiter stayed aloft for nearly 17 days.</p>
<p>The weather in Florida had been forecast to be acceptable on Friday, but thick fog failed to lift in time for the shuttle's landing.</p>
<p>The astronauts had closed the shuttle's cargo bay doors and climbed into bulky pressure suits in readiness for the planned touchdown. Strapped in their seats and eager for news, they asked mission control about the chances of them making it home on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's put it this way, the STA (Shuttle Training Aircraft) will probably land somewhere else,&quot; Brown replied.</p>
<p>The modified Gulfstream jet had taken off from the shuttle runway to provide weather reports for mission control, but was unable to return because of the fog. It eventually landed at Patrick Air Force Base, about 25 miles (40 km) to the south of the space centre.</p>
<p>Flight Director Wayne Hale said he hoped to bring the shuttle back to earth on Saturday at 6:50 a.m. EST (1150 GMT) at the Kennedy Space Centre. Florida weather, however, was likely to remain a problem, he cautioned.</p>
<p>&quot;Tomorrow is not going to be a pristine day according to our forecasters,&quot; he said at a news conference on Friday. &quot;We are not guarenteed to land there by any stretch of the imagination.&quot;</p>
<p>The prospects looked better for a California touchdown, he added. The shuttle has a landing slot there at 9:53 a.m. EST (1453 GMT).</p>
<p>The astronauts are equipped with enough food, oxygen and supplies for the shuttle to safely remain in orbit until Wednesday, Hale said.</p>
<p>Columbia's mission, which began on Nov. 19, was marred by a jammed airlock hatch that forced NASA to cancel a pair of space walks. Astronauts Tammy Jernigan and Tom Jones had spent months training for the spacewalks, which had been intended to test construction tools for a planned permanent space station.</p>
<p>Another problem cropped up this week when one of three crucial navigation tools stopped working. Although it briefly sprang back to life, the astronauts woke Thursday to an alarm in the cockpit when the device failed for a second time.</p>
<p>The shuttle can land safely on its two remaining inertial measurement units.</p>
<p>During the mission, the astronauts released and later retrieved two science satellites. A U.S.-German telescope studied the life cycles of stars and a prototype computer chip factory manufactured ultra-pure semiconductors for the electronics industry.</p>
