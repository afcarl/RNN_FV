<headline>News Corp expands music presence with Japanese venture.</headline>

<p>Moving to expand its role in the music industry, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd. Friday linked up with Japan's hottest record producer in a venture it expects to be profitable within two years.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect this venture to be profitable in the first year or two,&quot; said News Corp. President Peter Chernin at a news conference featuring Japanese music videos by Tetsuya Komuro, News Corp.'s partner in the venture.</p>
<p>The venture, to be called TK News, will be a music, television and multi-media production company initially developing and promoting Asian artists in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. In the future, it will expand to other parts of Asia, the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>Chernin said he expected TK News to generate significant revenues, but declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>In the last two years, Komuro-produced records have sold 55 million units. Gross sales of records produced by the 37-year-old Komuro, who is also a major recording star throughout Asia, have already reached $500 million in 1996, News Corp. said.</p>
<p>The joint venture begins Feb. 7 and will be based in Hong Kong. Its board will be co-chaired by Komuro and 25-year-old Lachlan Murdoch, son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch and managing director News Corp.'s Australian unit, News Ltd., and deputy chairman of STAR TV.</p>
<p>Chernin said News Corp.'s investment in the venture was minimal. He said News Corp. will continue to expand its music presence through more entrepreneurial ventures, but has no plans for major acquisitions at this time.</p>
<p>Lachlan Murdoch told Reuters after the news conference that News Corp. was not considering a bid for EMI Group Plc. Rumours of EMI's takeover have persisted since this summer's split up of Thorn EMI, its former parent.</p>
<p>News Corp.'s latest move into the music industry has fuelled renewed speculation this week of a bid for EMI.</p>
<p>Seagram Co. Ltd.'s MCA Music Group has also been consistently rumoured to be seeking a bid.</p>
<p>&quot;News Corp. is extremely committed to a growing role in the music industry as is reflected by the recent appointment of my brother, James, to vice president for music and new media for the company,&quot; Lachlan Murdoch said.</p>
<p>Lachlan said both he and James Murdoch, 23, worked closely with Komuro in the past few months to form the joint venture.</p>
<p>&quot;James will be spearheading News Corp.'s interest and involvements in the music businesess,&quot; Chernin said.</p>
<p>&quot;He'll be going around the world and doing an inventory of what our various interests are,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;James has been involved in the music business and will look for additional opportunities.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year, James, Murdoch's youngest son, co-founded his own record label, known as Rawkus Entertainment.</p>
<p>Murdoch's daughter Elizabeth, 28, is general manager of the British Sky Broadcasting satellite TV venture in London. Elizabeth and Lachlan, 25, are widely considered to be contenders to succeed their father.</p>
