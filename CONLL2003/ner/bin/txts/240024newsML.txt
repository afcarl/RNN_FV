US spot prods off at late day, unleaded diffs weak.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

U.S. spot refined products prices stood lower late Friday, particularly in the case of gasoline, as unleaded cash differentials weakened sharply both in New York Harbor (NYH) and in Houston, traders said.

Indeed the softer gasoline differentials easily offset the slight gasoline futures gains on the NYMEX, giving some traders a sense that oil markets may be on the verge of a bearish correction. But the NYMEX is not yet cooperating.

Nonetheless, cash gasoline stood anywhere from 1.00 cent to 2.00 cents a gallon lower, while the spot distillates, tracking NYMEX amid steady diffs, were about 0.50 cent lower.

Traders noted bearishness could be felt in the widespread lack of bidding during Friday's session which seemed to transcend the subdued nature of typical trading ahead of the weekend, since offers were numerous.

Additionally, refinery news on the U.S. Gulf Coast--that in a more bullish environment might have driven the market upward, was dismissed. A coker outage at Shell's Deer Park, Texas refinery and a H-oil outage at Star's Convent, Louisiana had no impact on heating oil, diesel or jet fuel prices.

On the gasoline front, conventional prices appeared to bear the brunt of the differential softening.

In Houston, prompt "M4" regular 87-octane conventional gasoline diffs weakened by as much as 2.00 cents, with trades heard done at 5.00, 4.85 and 4.75 cents under January NYMEX unleaded futures.

In NYH, prompt "A5" winter-grade regular 87-octane reformulated gasoline (RFG) was heard offered at 0.90 cent over the screen. This meant diffs had weakened by over 2.00 cents, though traders were quick to note that bids were scarce, making the significance of the lower offers difficult to gauge.

On the diesel front in Houston, back 34th cycle 86-grade heating oil was heard done at 3.75 and 3.70 cents under the January print.

Significant to the bearish school in spot refined products markets was the fact that low sulphur 74-grade diesel appeared to be barely fetching its typical premium over its higher sulphur cousin, 86-grade.

Traders said 74-grade got done Friday at 3.35 cents under January NYMEX, and possibly at levels as weak as 3.75 cents under the January print.

The latter weaker number inspired dismissive comments among some traders that position-talking was likely to become rampant in an overall oil market that appears near some kind of bearish correction.
