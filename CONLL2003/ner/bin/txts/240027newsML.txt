Clinton increases funding for N.Carolina storm.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

President Clinton Friday authorized an increase in federal funding for rebuilding public facilities in North Carolina damaged by Hurricane Fran in early September.

By law the federal government pays at least 75 percent of the eligible expenses for repair of disaster-damaged public facilities and other eligible expenses. Clinton issued an order increasing the federal share to 90 percent to reduce the financial burden on North Carolina.

"This increase in the cost-share will reduce the burden on the residents of North Carolina who have suffered so greatly from Hurricane Fran," Clinton said in a written statement. "Full recovery from this devastating storm will take some time, but we are encouraged by the progress that has been made in the past three months."

The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates the full cost of recovery from Hurricane Fran will exceed $445 million, or more than $67 per person in North Carolina.

The cost-share adjustment is retroactive to Sept. 6, date of Clinton's major disaster declaration for the state.
