Student admits to Florida bomb threat.

TAMPA, Fla. 1996-12-06

A former University of South Florida student faced the possibility of up to five years in prison after he pleaded guilty Friday to a charge of sending a letter threatening to kill a professor.

Damian Hospital, 19, a former history major, sent the threat in April saying he would blow up a building at the university, which is in Tampa.

University officials closed the campus that day but no bomb was found. Hospital was arrested when FBI agents examined his electronic mail and found similar writings.

He pleaded guilty to threatening to kill a professor in a federal court in Tampa. He also released a letter saying he felt extreme remorse and was undergoing psychiatric care.

Sentencing is set for Feb. 28, 1997, Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert O'Neill said.

"I expect we will see his attorney offer some mitigating information, perhaps his receiving psychiatric treatment," O'Neill told Reuters. "He could get as much as five years, or the judge could give him probation."

As part of Hospital's plea agreement he also agreed to reimburse the university for $41,050 in expenses related to the campus closing.
