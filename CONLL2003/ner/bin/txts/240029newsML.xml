<headline>Student admits to Florida bomb threat.</headline>
<dateline>TAMPA, Fla. 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>A former University of South Florida student faced the possibility of up to five years in prison after he pleaded guilty Friday to a charge of sending a letter threatening to kill a professor.</p>
<p>Damian Hospital, 19, a former history major, sent the threat in April saying he would blow up a building at the university, which is in Tampa.</p>
<p>University officials closed the campus that day but no bomb was found. Hospital was arrested when FBI agents examined his electronic mail and found similar writings.</p>
<p>He pleaded guilty to threatening to kill a professor in a federal court in Tampa. He also released a letter saying he felt extreme remorse and was undergoing psychiatric care.</p>
<p>Sentencing is set for Feb. 28, 1997, Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert O'Neill said.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect we will see his attorney offer some mitigating information, perhaps his receiving psychiatric treatment,&quot; O'Neill told Reuters. &quot;He could get as much as five years, or the judge could give him probation.&quot;</p>
<p>As part of Hospital's plea agreement he also agreed to reimburse the university for $41,050 in expenses related to the campus closing.</p>
