<title>USA: Vermont Nov tax receipts fall, tourists stay home.</title>
<headline>Vermont Nov tax receipts fall, tourists stay home.</headline>

<text>
<p>Vermont on Friday said that its tax receipts fell to $47.2 million, down 2.5 percent from a year-ago, partly because tourists, who often flock to the state in autumn to see the leaves change, stayed home.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, the Fall tourism season in Vermont was less than we had hoped it would be,&quot; said the Secretary of Administration, William Sorrell, in prepared remarks.</p>
<p>He explained the disappointing results from the tourism industry hurt receipts from the Sales and Use and the Meals and Rooms consumption taxes.</p>
<p>The broad-based drop in November's tax collections meant that the General Fund now is only $3.6 million ahead of target, down from $7.7 million ahead in October. Collections for the first five months added up to $290.3 million, 6.6 percent above the previous period.</p>
<p>And there is no guarantee that tax collections will remain strong for the rest of the state's fiscal year. &quot;It is unclear whether November's results represent a temporary halt in an otherwise generally favorable economic and revenue track for the state or are cause for genuine concern looking forward,&quot; Sorrell said.</p>
<p>November had one less banking day this year and Thanksgiving was late, two factors that might be responsible for some of the weakness. And on the plus side the Vermont official noted the property transfer tax rose 28 percent to $1.5 million.</p>
<p>But revenues collected for the Transportation Fund in November also were disappointing, as they fell 8.5 percent to $9.8 million from a year-ago.</p>
<p>The fund now is under $500,000 or less than one percent ahead of target for the first five months of the fiscal year, and Sorrell cited a combination of factors for the drop in receipts, including an accounting error.</p>
<p>&quot;Although a significant portion of November's underperformance can be attributable to a nearly $1 million accounts-posting error in the Gas Tax, ongoing weakness in the Motor Vehicle Fees component and other revenue category may be cause for some concern,&quot; he wrote.</p>
