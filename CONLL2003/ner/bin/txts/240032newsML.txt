US spot jet edges lower with NYMEX in slim trade.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

U.S. spot jet fuel prices edged moderately lower Friday tracking NYMEX heating oil, players said, with differentials little changed in lackluster trade.

New York Harbor aviation-quality 54-grade fuel was talked between 2.85 and 3.10 cents over the January print, with front-34th cycle Gulf Coast material exchanging hands for 0.90 cent below the print.

"It's Sleepyland down here," one Gulf Coast player said, adding deals were few and far between ahead of the weekend.

He said jet supplies did not seem greatly affected by several reported refinery problems on the Gulf Coast.

They included a downed coker at Shell Oil's Deer Park, Texas, refinery, and a downed H-oil unit at Star Enterprise's refinery in Convent, Louisiana.
