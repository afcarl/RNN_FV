GM reaches tentative labor pact with electrical union.

DETROIT 1996-12-06

General Motors Corp., wrapping up its final national labor agreement, said Friday it has reached a tentative pact on a new three-year contract with the International Union of Electronic Workers (IUE).

Details of the contract were not released. But a union spokesman said the new pact includes wage increases for each of the three years and additional job security provisions.

"There are a lot of goodies in there," said IUE spokesman Danny Groff.

GM and the IUE said in a joint statement they reached a new deal about 3 a.m. EST Friday. In addition to the wage and benefit improvements, they said the contract allows GM flexibility to improve its competitiveness.

"We believe it is a balanced agreement that addresses the needs of emplloyees, the IUE and GM," said a joint statement issued by GM Vice President of Personnel Gerald Knechtel and Ron Gilvin, chairman of the IUE-GM Conference Board.

The IUE represents about 21,000 U.S. hourly workers at the automaker. Most of them work at parts plants under GM's Delphi Automotive Systems unit.

Ratification by members is expected to begin next week and be completed by Dec. 15.

Previous IUE contracts have generally followed what GM and the United Auto Workers union decide. Last month, GM and the UAW tentatively agreed to a three-year deal that gives workers a $2,000 lump sum payment in the first year and wage hikes of 3 percent in the second and third years.

Knechtel and UAW Vice President Richard Shoemaker, who heads the union's GM Department, will sign the new national agreement at a ceremony Monday.

In a sign that GM's relations with the UAW remain strained, neither GM Chairman Jack Smith or UAW President Stephen Yokich are scheduled to be at the GM event.

Both Chrysler Corp. Chairman Robert Eaton and Yokich participated in a joint signing ceremony at the UAW's Solidarity House headquarters for the Chrysler contract.

In addition, GM has only reached tentative agreements with about 25 percent to 30 percent of its 110 UAW local union organizations. The UAW represents about 215,000 workers at GM.
