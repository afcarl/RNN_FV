<text>
<p>General Motors Corp., wrapping up its final national labor agreement, said Friday it has reached a tentative pact on a new three-year contract with the International Union of Electronic Workers (IUE).</p>
<p>Details of the contract were not released. But a union spokesman said the new pact includes wage increases for each of the three years and additional job security provisions.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of goodies in there,&quot; said IUE spokesman Danny Groff.</p>
<p>GM and the IUE said in a joint statement they reached a new deal about 3 a.m. EST Friday. In addition to the wage and benefit improvements, they said the contract allows GM flexibility to improve its competitiveness.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe it is a balanced agreement that addresses the needs of emplloyees, the IUE and GM,&quot; said a joint statement issued by GM Vice President of Personnel Gerald Knechtel and Ron Gilvin, chairman of the IUE-GM Conference Board.</p>
<p>The IUE represents about 21,000 U.S. hourly workers at the automaker. Most of them work at parts plants under GM's Delphi Automotive Systems unit.</p>
<p>Ratification by members is expected to begin next week and be completed by Dec. 15.</p>
<p>Previous IUE contracts have generally followed what GM and the United Auto Workers union decide. Last month, GM and the UAW tentatively agreed to a three-year deal that gives workers a $2,000 lump sum payment in the first year and wage hikes of 3 percent in the second and third years.</p>
<p>Knechtel and UAW Vice President Richard Shoemaker, who heads the union's GM Department, will sign the new national agreement at a ceremony Monday.</p>
<p>In a sign that GM's relations with the UAW remain strained, neither GM Chairman Jack Smith or UAW President Stephen Yokich are scheduled to be at the GM event.</p>
<p>Both Chrysler Corp. Chairman Robert Eaton and Yokich participated in a joint signing ceremony at the UAW's Solidarity House headquarters for the Chrysler contract.</p>
<p>In addition, GM has only reached tentative agreements with about 25 percent to 30 percent of its 110 UAW local union organizations. The UAW represents about 215,000 workers at GM.</p>
