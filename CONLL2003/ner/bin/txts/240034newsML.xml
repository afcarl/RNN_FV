<title>USA: Consumer credit buying bounced back in October.</title>

<p>Consumers picked up the pace on credit buying again in October after paying down debts during September for the first time in more than three years, the Federal Reserve said Friday.</p>
<p>Total U.S. consumer instalment credit oustanding increased by $2.2 billion at a 2.3 percent annual rate after dropping a revised $700 million in September at a 0.8 percent annual rate.</p>
<p>Previously, the central bank said September consumer credit had fallen by $2.6 billion -- the first fall since a $200 million decline in May 1993 -- but it revised that on the basis of later data showing auto loans were stronger than it first thought.</p>
<p>Even with October's bounceback, consumer credit buying was still growing more moderately as the third quarter ended and the fourth quarter began than it was earlier in the year.</p>
<p>During the first six months this year, instalment purchases leapt upward at a monthly rate of nearly 10 percent before consumers began reining in their use of credit and lenders started stiffening terms for issuing credit cards.</p>
<p>The Fed has been warning against potential credit excesses, pointing out that consumers cannot indefintely spend more than they earn without dire consequences.</p>
<p>&quot;Roughly for every extra $1 we're earning, we're spending $1.10,&quot; Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey said Thursday in a speech to a consumer group. He warned it was pushing more households to the brink of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>During October, auto loans were unchanged from September after climbing by $500 million in September. Dealer sales were soft in October, partly because some popular models were in scarce supply due to parts shortages caused by strikes in Canada against industry leader General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>Revolving or credit-card debt increased in October by $1.5 billion at a 4 percent annual rate, compared with an $800 million September advance at a 2 percent annual rate.</p>
<p>Other credit, which includes consumer bank loans like those for mobile homes but not real estate mortgages, grew by $800 million at a 2.8 percent annual rate in October after falling $2 billion at a 7.1 percent annual rate in September.</p>
<p>Before seasonal adjustment, the Fed said consumers owed a total of $1.18 trillion in October, unchanged from September but up from $1.08 trillion a year earlier in October 1995.</p>
