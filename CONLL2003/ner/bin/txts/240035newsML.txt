Albright, Christopher begin mapping transition.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

Secretary of State-designate Madeleine Albright began mapping her transition on Friday, holding talks with the man she will replace and scheduling another planning session for Saturday.

The immediacy and closeness of the cooperation seemed at odds with some recent predecessors, notably Republicans James Baker and George Shultz who did not get along and kept an icy distance when Baker succeeded Shultz in 1989.

Albright, the U.N. ambassador named Thursday to assume the top U.S. diplomatic job in Democratic President Bill Clinton's second administration, met early with current Secretarty of State Warren Christopher at the State Department.

"They had a very good conversation, the first of many conversations they intend to have about the transition," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters.

"As you know, they go back a long way. They're very close friends. They're partners. And they intend to have a transition which is going to be very cooperative. They intend to meet often," including a session Saturday, he said.

Albright was back in New York later on Friday but she and Christopher are "going to spend many hours together tomorrow talking about the department, talking about substantive issues, talking about personnel issues, and they will continue to do that throughout the transition," Burns said.

Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who will stay in that position under Albright, is heading the transition and will also be part of the Saturday discussions.

"This should produce a great deal of continuity in our operation, and it should allow both Secretary Christopher to continue to do his job -- 14, 15 hours a day -- and also Secretary-designate Albright -- to make sure that when and if she is confirmed that she will hit the ground running, and have a very fast start as secretary of state," Burns said.
