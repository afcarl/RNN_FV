U.S. sees Pakistan government tougher on Taleban.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

Pakistan's new caretaker government is more critical than its predecessor of the Islamic fundamentalist Taleban movement which has seized control of most of Afghanistan, U.S. officials said on Friday.

They were speaking after what the State Department described as good conversations between U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Pakistani Foreign Minister Sahibzada Yaqoob Khan on Afghanistan and other issues.

"I think in general the new interim Pakistani government seems to be more critical of some of the Taleban practices, and are open about it," said one State Department official who asked not to be identified.

"Certainly (it) is following a policy which we believe is consistent with our own, which is: don't stoke the fires, don't try to encourage further violence in Afghanistan, try to encourage peaceful discussion of the problem."

The ousted Pakistani government of Benazir Bhutto has been widely reported to have backed Taleban, which captured some two thirds of Afghanistan in September, including the capital Kabul, but has failed to gain control of the whole country.

The United States has denounced Taleban's tough Islamic restrictions on women and girls.

State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Christopher and Yaqoob Khan had "an excellent meeting in all respects".

He said they also discussed internal developments in Pakistan, prospects for dialogue between Pakistan and its rival India, and U.S. concerns about non-proliferation.

"The secretary applauded the interim government's efforts to restore economic stability in Pakistan. He urged the government to adhere to Pakistan's constitution and the rule of law," Burns said.

Pakistani President Farooq Leghari dismissed Bhutto on charges of corruption and misrule, and dissolved the National Assembly Nov. 5. He named a caretaker government under Meraj Khalid to supervise elections Feb. 3.

Burns said Yaqoob Khan informed Christopher about discussions he expects to hold with Indian officials during a ministerial meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) later this month.

Burns said Christopher "reiterated in familiar terms our policy" on Chinese arms sales to Pakistan. The United States has repeatedly expressed concern over reports of sales of nuclear and missile technology, but has stopped short of declaring that they violate U.S. anti-proliferation laws.
