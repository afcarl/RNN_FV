Fugitive embezzler appears in Denver court.

DENVER 1996-12-06

George Norman, an embezzler accused of making his escape by stealing a judge's Cadillac, appeared in court on Friday -- 23 years after he fled.

A Feb. 3 date was set for Norman's trial on charges of stealing the Cadillac and transporting it over state lines.

Norman, 66, remains in federal custody, serving the sentence for bank fraud that he fled. A not-guilty plea was entered on his behalf by a federal magistrate during an arraignment hearing.

In 1973, Norman was preparing to serve a two-year sentence for embezzling $500,000 from a suburban Denver bank when he asked authorities for a little time to arrange his affairs before he was to surrender. He then fled Denver, allegedly in a 1968 Cadillac borrowed from a Colorado Supreme Court Judge, who was a friend.

That was the last authorities saw of him until last month when federal marshals caught up with him outside a motel in Knoxville, Tenn.

His attorney declined to comment on government claims Norman amassed a fortune worth more than $50 million, reportedly made in low-priced stocks, according to the government.
