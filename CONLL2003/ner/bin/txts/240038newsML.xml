<title>USA: Fugitive embezzler appears in Denver court.</title>
<headline>Fugitive embezzler appears in Denver court.</headline>
<dateline>DENVER 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>George Norman, an embezzler accused of making his escape by stealing a judge's Cadillac, appeared in court on Friday -- 23 years after he fled.</p>
<p>A Feb. 3 date was set for Norman's trial on charges of stealing the Cadillac and transporting it over state lines.</p>
<p>Norman, 66, remains in federal custody, serving the sentence for bank fraud that he fled. A not-guilty plea was entered on his behalf by a federal magistrate during an arraignment hearing.</p>
<p>In 1973, Norman was preparing to serve a two-year sentence for embezzling $500,000 from a suburban Denver bank when he asked authorities for a little time to arrange his affairs before he was to surrender. He then fled Denver, allegedly in a 1968 Cadillac borrowed from a Colorado Supreme Court Judge, who was a friend.</p>
<p>That was the last authorities saw of him until last month when federal marshals caught up with him outside a motel in Knoxville, Tenn.</p>
<p>His attorney declined to comment on government claims Norman amassed a fortune worth more than $50 million, reportedly made in low-priced stocks, according to the government.</p>
