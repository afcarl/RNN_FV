Commodity markets shaken by fall in stock market.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

A sharp drop in stock markets Friday rattled commodity markets with cattle, corn, soybeans and lumber futures ending lower, and gold and silver markets gyrating sharply before ending lower.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 140 points early Friday, which fuelled selling in several commodity markets on the belief the economy was turning sluggish and consumer spending for homes and high-priced foods would slow.

The Dow later recovered to close down 55.16 points at 6,381.94, but several commodity markets retained the scars from the earlier stock market drop.

Concerns about an economic slowdown weighed on live cattle futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on the feeling that consumers will buy fewer high-priced steaks and roasts.

However, Chuck Levitt, analyst with Alaron Trading Corp., said those perceptions are not always true. He said during poor economic times consumers may travel less but will be more inclined to dine at home on high-priced steaks and wine.

CME December live cattle futures closed down 1 cent at 65.425 cents per pound, the lowest close in 4-1/2 months.

The selling spilled into Chicago Board of Trade corn and soybean markets because less demand for beef could curb usage of these two livestock feed ingredients.

CBOT December corn closed down 1-1/4 cents at $2.67-1/4 per bushel and January soybeans were off 6 cents at $6.96 per bushel. Soybeans are crushed into soymeal, which is then fed to cattle and hogs. CBOT December soymeal closed down $1.40 at $233.20 per ton.

CME lumber futures were hit by stock market-based selling largely on assumptions that home buying will slow during a slow economic cycle, traders said.

Some analysts argued that lumber futures were due for a downturn after surging sharply higher in recent months.

Analysts said recent government reports suggested home buying was slowing down. The Commerce Department this week reported October new home sales were down 8.7 percent from September, the largest month-to-month drop since March.

"They (housing reports) are all pointing to a very significant slowdown," said Neil Schmaedick, forest products analyst with Smith Barney.

CME January lumber was down $6.10 at $409.30 per 1,000 board feet.

New York gold and silver markets bounded higher early Friday as the stocks fell, but later turned lower after a slowdown in jobs growth eased inflation concerns.

"If it hadn't been for the weak U.S. employment data, which tempered the falls in U.S. bonds and stocks, gold may have done better and continued its recovery from last month's slide," said John Brimelow, New York director of international equities for German bank BV Capital.

New York Commodity Exchange February gold ended down $2.20 at $370.80 an ounce. COMEX March silver closed down 8.7 cents at $4.805.

New York Mercantile Exchange crude oil prices managed to end with small gains after U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali could not confirm reports that Iraqi oil exports would start next week.

"There is a euphoria in the market that you just can't break," said Steve Platt, an analyst with Dean Witter, noting bullish sentiment had the market focusing more on Boutros-Ghali's comments.

Crude for January delivery settled up 4 cents at $25.62 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. January heating oil ended off 0.45 cent at 74.66 cents a gallon, and January gasoline ended up 0.12 cent at 69.80 cents per gallon.
