Clinton urged to raise funds for foreign affairs.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

A senior member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee called on U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday to back his nominee for secretary of state by seeking more money to help her do her job.

Sen. Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana, was commenting on Clinton's announcement on Thursday that he will nominate United Nations Ambassador Madeleine Albright as secretary of state.

"Even as the president enjoys applause for the historic act of naming the highest-ranking woman to serve in our government, he has not taken the decisive action necessary to make certain that the new secretary of state has a budget for diplomacy that could make a constructive difference if either he or she had a strategic vision," Lugar said.

Congress has made sweeping cuts in the U.S. foreign affairs budget and current Secretary of State Warren Christopher has warned that failure to maintain America's "diplomatic readiness" could result in shifting the burden to the military.

Lugar, second-ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, is an internationalist often opposed to the policies advocated by its conservative chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who has often been harshly critical of the State Department.

Lugar said Clinton's budget office had rejected Christopher's request for more money for foreign affairs. He said he and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, had written to Clinton asking him to intervene on the budget issue.

Albright was one of four members of the administration's national security team announced by Clinton. The others were retiring Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine as Defence Secretary, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake as CIA director and deputy adviser Samuel Berger as Lake's successor.

Lugar said that the new team, with the exception of Cohen, consisted of the same group that "shared, tolerated and articulated the president's very cautious and limited foreign policy agenda for the last four years."

He said it was not clear whether Albright would be given the authority and support to be a bold architect of foreign policy, "or whether she will be smothered in a minimalist foreign policy and left to articulate the cautious and often tardy responses to crises from a cautious president."

He said he planned to question Albright on a wide range of world issues at her confirmation hearings after Congress convenes in January.
