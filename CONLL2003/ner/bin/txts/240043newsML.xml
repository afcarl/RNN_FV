<p>Lawyers for three career soldiers accused of sexual misconduct in the U.S. Army's biggest sex scandal asked a military judge on Friday to slap a gag order on military leaders, saying the top officials had made their clients seem guilty before they were tried.</p>
<p>The lawyers made their charge during the soldiers' first court appearence -- an arraignment hearing at the sprawling Aberdeen Proving Ground Military Base -- since the scandal broke last month.</p>
<p>Secretary of the Army Togo West had accused the men of abusing their power and ordered all soldiers to undergo sexual harassment training so they could learn about the army's policy toward sexual harassment -- &quot;zero tolerance.&quot;</p>
<p>The defendants, a captain charged with rape, a sergeant charged with raping five women, and another sergeant charged with adultery, seemed sombre as they appeared before Military Judge Linda Webster, a lieutenant colonel. They called her &quot;ma'am&quot; when they addressed her.</p>
<p>Following military court tradition, the three deferred entering pleas until the trials actually started.</p>
<p>The three soldiers were accused of sexually abusing women soldier trainees under their command. As a result of the charges against them, the base here set up a hotline for other women soldiers to call-in incidences of abuse, and the story has been featured widely in the media.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Capt. Derrick Robertson and Sgts. Delmar Simpson and Nathanael Beech accused the military chain of command as having made comments and taken actions that appear to pre-judge the cases and making it difficult for their clients to receive a fair trial.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been an orchestrated release of information by the secretary of the army (and others). This has been unprecedented in my 11 years in the military. There has even been the setting up of a hotline to report sexual abuse,&quot; Capt. Roberston's attorney Jerome Murphy told Judge Webster.</p>
<p>He said it has placed his client in a untenable position. He added that the three cases were completely separate, and yet the three men were treated as if they were co-defendants.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no conspiracy. There is no linking of the three,&quot; he said, with the judge agreeing.</p>
<p>He asked Webster to slap a gag order on the secretary of the army, the secretary of defence and even the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, but she wondered whether she had such power and deferred her judgment.</p>
<p>However, she did order that prospective jurors in the three cases be barred from talking about the case, reading about it, or watching anything about it on television.</p>
<p>Vincent Aballone, the lawyer for Beech, told the judge the charges against his client were minor compared to the charges against the other two and asked, &quot;Why has the army chosen to publicise this case?&quot; He added that the pretrial publicity hinted at unlawful command influence.</p>
<p>Beech is charged with adultery for having consensual sex with a private who was under his command and also asking her to write a test paper for him.</p>
