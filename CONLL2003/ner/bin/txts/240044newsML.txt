FOB Gulf Grain - FOB values remain unchanged.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

U.S. Gulf FOB basis values were unchanged on Friday in very quiet trading, exporters said.

"There is absolutely nothing going on in the cash markets," a trader said.

U.S. wheat is still overvalued relative to that of other major exporters, so the U.S. wheat export market remained lackluster, dealers said.

Some exporters were cheered by news that the U.S. and Turkey has ironed out recent differences over phytosanitary concerns, they said.

However, the U.S. attache in Argentina raised that country's wheat forecast by one million tonnes to 15.5 million tonnes. Argentina is expected to be an aggressive exporter when the crop becomes available in late December.
