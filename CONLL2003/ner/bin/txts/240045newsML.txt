DC council tentatively agrees to major budget cuts.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

The District of Columbia council tentatively agreed Friday morning to recommend firing 1,000 city workers and slashing coveted youth programs to head off forced cuts by the city's control board, a knowledgeable source said.

The cuts informally agreed to so far would reduce a projected $85.4 million city budget deficit in fiscal year 1997 by roughly $67 million, to about $18.4 million, the source said.

The council is scheduled to go back into closed session later this evening, the source said.

"No votes were taken," the source said. "It's a working document. But council members did tentatively "come to a consensus" on some cuts, the source said.

They include a reduction in force of 1,000 city employees, saving the city $26 million, the source said.

Council members also decided tentatively not to bail out the struggling University of District of Columbia, which needs $16 million to fund a budget deficit, the source said.

Council members also want to cut $8 million from the city's summer youth program and youth violence prevention program, the source said.

And most council members want $11 million in additional workforce reductions that already are planned by the city, the source said.

"It's rough," the source said. "Those are the big items. They have to go back to see if there are more areas as well. The hope is to come up with close to $85 million" in cuts, the source said.

D.C. finance chief Anthony Williams announced last month that the city faces an $85.4 million FY'97 budget deficit and handed officials an options paper with 38 possible program cuts.

The source said council members are using the options paper as a working document.
