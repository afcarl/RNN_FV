<headline>DC council tentatively agrees to major budget cuts.</headline>

<p>The District of Columbia council tentatively agreed Friday morning to recommend firing 1,000 city workers and slashing coveted youth programs to head off forced cuts by the city's control board, a knowledgeable source said.</p>
<p>The cuts informally agreed to so far would reduce a projected $85.4 million city budget deficit in fiscal year 1997 by roughly $67 million, to about $18.4 million, the source said.</p>
<p>The council is scheduled to go back into closed session later this evening, the source said.</p>
<p>&quot;No votes were taken,&quot; the source said. &quot;It's a working document. But council members did tentatively &quot;come to a consensus&quot; on some cuts, the source said.</p>
<p>They include a reduction in force of 1,000 city employees, saving the city $26 million, the source said.</p>
<p>Council members also decided tentatively not to bail out the struggling University of District of Columbia, which needs $16 million to fund a budget deficit, the source said.</p>
<p>Council members also want to cut $8 million from the city's summer youth program and youth violence prevention program, the source said.</p>
<p>And most council members want $11 million in additional workforce reductions that already are planned by the city, the source said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's rough,&quot; the source said. &quot;Those are the big items. They have to go back to see if there are more areas as well. The hope is to come up with close to $85 million&quot; in cuts, the source said.</p>
<p>D.C. finance chief Anthony Williams announced last month that the city faces an $85.4 million FY'97 budget deficit and handed officials an options paper with 38 possible program cuts.</p>
<p>The source said council members are using the options paper as a working document.</p>
