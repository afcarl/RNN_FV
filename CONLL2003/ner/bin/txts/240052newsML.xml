<title>USA: Wisconsin stadium board may issue more debt.</title>
<headline>Wisconsin stadium board may issue more debt.</headline>

<p>A Wisconsin board charged with financing a $250 million professional baseball stadium in Milwaukee may be issuing more debt in the future.</p>
<p>The Southeast Wisconsin Professional Baseball Park District Board sold $146.7 million of convertible option bonds Wednesday in an unusual deal that placed all the bond proceeds in an escrow fund with Banc One Indianpolis pending a mandatory tender sometime next year.</p>
<p>Pat Born, a senior vice president at Evensen Dodge, Inc., he board's financial adviser, said Friday the baseball park district may issue up to $15 million of parity notes to fund project costs.</p>
<p>He said the note issue may be needed because the board will not be unable to access bond proceeds from Wednesday's deal until a mandatory tender of the bonds is completed and the bonds are remarketed as long-term, fixed-rate securities.</p>
<p>Born said the notes would be taken out with the remarketing of the convertible option bonds. He added the notes would possibly be privately placed without any enhancement.</p>
<p>In addition, the board has the ability under a Wisconsin law that created the district to issue an unlimited amount of debt for the project, according to Born and others familiar with the legislation. That is because the legislation only caps the district's debt issuance at $160 million if Wisconsin's moral obligation pledge is used.</p>
<p>Wednesday's deal was sold without the state's pledge and was rated MIG1 by Moody's Investors Service based on escrow agreements and the investment of bond proceeds into a guarenteed investment contract provided by triple-A rated Bayerische Landesbank.</p>
<p>Norman Mater, the district's general counsel, said the board has no current plans to issue more debt, but has the option to sell more than $160 million of debt.</p>
<p>Greater debt issuance by the district could come into play should the project for the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team exceed the current cost of $250 million, Born said, adding however, that costs are not expected to go over that amount.</p>
<p>To that end, one lawmaker has requested a construction cost audit from the Legislative Audit Bureau. State Rep. Bob Ziegelbauer, D-Manitowoc, said he wants the audit to determine whether the project is on the road to possibly exceeding a $250 million cap called for under a memorandum of understanding between the state, the Brewers and other governments.</p>
<p>Ziegelbauer, who served on a legislative committee that worked on the bill for the stadium, acknowledged that under the law the project could go over $250 million. He said cost overruns and a district bond issuance exceeding $160 million to cover those overruns would be considered a violation of the memorandum.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully (the board) will be at the limit or under the limit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the $146.7 million of convertible option bonds were sold with an interest rate of 4.1 percent mainly to mutual funds and corporation, Born said.</p>
<p>While the  5.31 percent interest rate on the GIC is higher than the rate on the bonds, Born said the board expects the blended rate between the convertible option bonds and the remarketed long-term bonds to fall below the GIC rate and future investment rates for arbitrage rebate purposes.</p>
<p>He said the deal was structured similarly to state housing agency deals, where the issuer may not be ready to issue long-term debt.</p>
<p>Born said the board needed to do the issue before the end of the year to avoid running into problems with the anticipated reintroduction of a bill by U.S. Sen. Patrick Moynihan that would prohibit the use of tax-exempt debt for professional sports stadiums.</p>
<p>He said the structure preserves the district's ability to sell long-term tax-exempt debt under Internal Revenue Service rules.</p>
