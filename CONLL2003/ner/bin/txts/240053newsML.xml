<title>USA: U.S. cash crudes gain late on bullish sentiment.</title>

<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. cash crudes gained back all the ground lost during the day on bullish sentiment fueled by low crude stocks and technical considerations, traders said.</p>
<p>Crude had tumbled earlier in the day on news of Iraq's imminent market re-entry and the end of a nine-day strike at three French refineries, but prices quickly rebounded.</p>
<p>January West Texas Intermediate/Cushing was trading around $25.55-65 a barrel, flat with late Thursday's cash market.</p>
<p>The Jan/Feb WTI spread held firm at 60 cents.</p>
<p>Grade business was light heading into the weekend.  </p>
<p>Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James was two to six cents stronger than late Thursday, trading in a range of 91-95 cents over WTI/Cushing.</p>
<p>Sweet grades have benefitted from the closed trans-Atlantic arbitrage amid robust refinery demand.</p>
<p>WTI/Midland changed hands at a one cent premium to WTI/Cushing, a penny weaker than deal done on Thursday.</p>
<p>West Texas Sour/Midland was done at $1.90 a barrel, five cents weaker than a deal on Thursday.</p>
<p>The market seemed particularly bullish in light of a slew of news indicating that Iraqi oil sales could begin as early as next week.</p>
