<headline>NYMEX crude ends slightly up despite bearish news.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>NYMEX crude managed to end with small gains on Friday as bullish sentiment overwhelmed a raft of bearish news including the end of a French strike and reports that Iraqi oil exports would resume next week.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a euphoria in the market that you just can't break,&quot; said Steve Platt, an analyst with Dean Witter.</p>
<p>January crude ended four cents higher at $25.62 a barrel.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Iraqi Oil Minister General Amir Muhammad Rasheed said in an interview shown on Iraqi state television that Iraq expects to be able to resume oil exports on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Later a U.N. official said U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was expected to give clearance for the start of Iraqi oil sales on Monday. But, Boutros-Ghali responded by saying he could not confirm this.</p>
<p>&quot;When Boutros-Ghali made that statement, prices popped back up,&quot; said a dealer in New York, explaining bullish sentiment focused the market more on the U.N. Secretary-General's response.</p>
<p>Crude was also bolstered by January gasoline which ended up 0.12 cent a gallon at 69.80 cents. January heating oil finished down 0.45 cent a gallon at 74.66 cents.</p>
<p>Under a U.N. oil-for-food deal, the United Nations would ease sanctions against Iraq and allow Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil in exchange for humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>After the market's close Friday, a U.N. official said Dutch firm Saybolt found Iraqi oil metering equipment functional, clearing the last technical hurdle for the oil-for-food deal.</p>
<p>Gasoline posted gains despite an end by workers in France of a nine-day strike at three refineries owned by oil giant Elf Aquitaine. The strike crippled a quarter of French refinery capacity, boosting refined product prices here and in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;Gasoline stocks are still low, and buy stops were triggered when gasoline started to recover,&quot; said a trader of gasoline's ability to post gains after dropping on the strike's end. Indeed, prompt gasoline reached an intraday contract high of 70.10 cents.</p>
<p>Traders said stocks of crude are also low when demand is seasonally high due to winter heating oil requirements.</p>
<p>Chartists said the oil complex was able to continually make higher highs in the face of strong technical resistance throughout the week. January crude was able to close above its previous contract high of $25.20 it broke Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market seems to be marching with an objective in mind,&quot; said a trader in New York, noting crude was only 50 cents a way from breaking its post-Gulf War high of $26.10 made on October 22.</p>
