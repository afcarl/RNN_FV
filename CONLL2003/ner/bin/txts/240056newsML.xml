<headline>Dollar recovers from sharp early losses to end mixed.</headline>

<p>Cheered by a dramatic recovery in the stock and bond markets, the dollar rebounded from a sharp overseas slide Friday to end a wild roller-coaster session mixed against other major currencies.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to lows of 1.5280 marks and 111.73 yen in European trade after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan spooked investors by warning against &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in booming U.S. markets in a speech late Thursday.</p>
<p>But by the end of the day, the dollar had recovered to 1.5465 marks, only modestly lower than its Thursday close of 1.5498. Against the yen, the dollar ended at 112.88, up from 112.33.</p>
<p>The central bank chief's remarks sparked fears that the stock market bubble could soon burst and sent foreign stock markets reeling in sympathy. In anticipation of a similar meltdown once U.S. trading began, the dollar slid sharply overnight.</p>
<p>As expected, both bonds and stocks stumbled badly early in the day, with the 30-year Treasury bond falling close to a point-and-a-half and the Dow Jones industrials shedding over 140 points.</p>
<p>&quot;Initially the dollar definitely followed the meltdown in stocks and bonds,&quot; said Doug Lee, assistant vice president and corporate dealer at Sakura Bank Ltd. &quot;The timing of the Greenspan remarks was key because the markets had run up so high in the last week and people saw an opportunity to take profits.&quot;</p>
<p>But weak U.S. employment data proved to be a saviour for bonds, which in turn helped stocks and the dollar erase a good deal of their early losses.</p>
<p>The Labour Department reported that non-farm payrolls expanded by 118,000 in November, a far weaker advance than most Wall Street economists had anticipated. The report also showed that the unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent in November from 5.2 percent the prior month, allowing bonds to rebound to near flat on the day.</p>
<p>&quot;The payrolls report helped to stabilise the bonds and that helped to stabilise the dollar,&quot; said Mike Malpede, senior foreign exchange analyst at Refco Group Ltd in Chicago.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on Friday, the resignation of a British Conservative member of Parliament wiped out the one seat majority of Prime Minister John Major's government, hurting the British pound in late-morning trade.</p>
<p>But sterling recovered its luster in the afternoon, ending the day at $1.6467, up from $1.6352 on Thursday.</p>
<p>In other trading, the dollar rose modestly to 1.3158 Swiss francs from 1.3135 on Thursday. It also ended the day moderately higher at Canadian $1.3594 against C$1.3565.</p>
