U.S MUNICIPAL FOCUS - prices soft, issuance rises.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

U.S. muni bonds late Friday won back most but not all of their losses after surprising weak payrolls data helped erase a roughly one-point drop hit on concerns raised by the Federal Reserve Chairman on Thursday.

Traders estimated that prices were off about 3/8 of a point in late trade, lagging the benchmark Treasuries, which were able to wipe out most of their dive after the Labor Department surprised the market with a report that showed the economy was not as strong as feared.  

The unemployment rate, which had been expected in a Reuters consensus survey of economists to steady at 5.2 percent, instead rose two percentage points in November, while the economy only added 179,000 jobs, even less than October's modest addition of 210,000.

The data, which suggested inflation is not a near-term problem, soothed players who were spooked by statements made by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Chairman, who on Thursday warned the financial markets of "irrational exuberance."  

While traders were encouraged by the latest economic data, they remained wary because Greenspan's comments had provoked a worldwide sell-off overnight. "The technical damage, the psychological damage, there's a lot to worry about," a trader said, explaining equities markets, which Greenspan singled out, might not recover their euphoria.

In the long-term, any chipping away at the striking preference investors have had for equities could work in favor of the fixed-income market, which has been shunned because it has offered lower returns for much of the year, he added.  

For the municipal market, however, digesting next week's new issuances, with around $5.3 billion slated for sale, over $1 billion more than this week, could prove a daunting short-term challenge.

"I think they'll be volume to worry about," a trader said, explaining that next week could see the largest volume of new issues for the rest of 1996, as after that period, many market participants will start closing books and taking vacation ahead of the Christmas holiday on December 25.  

Next week's competitive calender includes $1.384 billion in 94 offerings, with the largest a $165 million Metro Atlanta RTA on December 11. Negotiated sales total $3.930 billion in 69 offerings, with the largest a $579 million Municipal Assistance Corp of New York City issue through Morgan Stanley.

Further, the market next week will have to digest a series of economic reports for November, including producer prices on Wednesday, which are forecast to rise 0.3 percent, one percentage point less than in October, and consumer prices, which are predicted at up 0.3 percent, unchanged.  

Retail sales, expected to rise one percentage point to a 0.3 percent gain, are due on Thursday, when the Atlanta Fed Index, which in October fell 9.4 percent, also is due.

The March municipal bond futures traded on the Chicago Board of Trade fell eight ticks to 113-27/32, while the March Treasury bond futures shed 11 ticks to 115-30/32. In the cash market, however, the benchmark U.S. Treasuries in late trade were pegged at down only three ticks at 99-26/32.

The MOB spread between the two futures contracts stood at plus 67 ticks, around 15-20 ticks above levels seen early this week.

In the secondary municipal market, actively quoted issues included Texas State Turnpike Authority Dallas North Thruway Revenues of January 2023, which pay a 5-1/4 percent coupon, and were bid at 5.62 percent NET, up four basis points.

And North Carolina Eastern Mountain Power Agency of January 2024, which have a 5-5/8 percent coupon, were offered at 98-3/4, up 1/4 of a point.
