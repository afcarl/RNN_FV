U.S. foreign crudes still pricey, arb closed.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

U.S. foreign crudes remained pricey Friday compared to domestic alternatives, reflecting the closed trans-Atlantic arbitrage, traders said.

The spread between January West Texas Intermediate and North Sea Brent widened to widened to $1.15-20 a barrel, up about 10 cents from late Thursday, but still short of the level at which trans-Atlantic cargoes would be economic.

"I don't see any cargoes coming over yet, but they'll be here," one trader said.

The notional price into the U.S. Gulf Coast would be around Jan WTI plus 50-60 cents, "and buyers aren't willing to pay that yet," he said.

In Latin America, Argentine YPF signed a four-month term contract with Unocal for 12,000 barrels per day of Rincon crude, trade sources said.

Tosco originally held a term contract for 24,000 bpd, but opted not to renew when YPF raised the price, the sources said.

Unocal bid for and was awarded half of Tosco's prior contract volume, paying around February WTI minus 90 cents, around 40 cents higher than Tosco's price, they said.

YPF is expected to sell the remaining 12,000 bpd on the spot market.

In the U.S. aftermarket, a full boat of January paper Brent traded at $24.65 a barrel, 15 cents higher than the IPE settlement price, traders said.

A partial January Brent cargo changed hands at $24.35 a barrel, 15 cents under the London close.

Intermonth spreads were stronger, with Brent Jan/Feb trading at 71/72 cents, 11-12 cents over the London settlement.
