U.S. CREDIT OUTLOOK - Relaxing after wild ride.

U.S. credit markets are expected to settle down next week after sharp price fluctuations over the past few days had most participants biting their nails in anxiety.

Although some key indicators will be released next week, including producer and consumer price indices, analysts said the data are not expected have the stamina to shake the U.S. Treasury market either way.

"Things are probably going to come down," said Christopher Low, senior economist at HSBC Markets Inc.  

"Next week's data do not have quite the same capacity to shock (as the employment report released Friday does). Although the inflation numbers could be on the high side," the HSBC senior economist added.

The U.S. Treasury market fluctuated sharply late this week after a mixed employment report for November and remarks by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan sent prices on a wild roller coaster ride.

The Labor Department said on Friday that non-farm payrolls rose a lower-than-expected 118,000 figure in November against a revised 224,000 increase in the previous month.  

On the other hand, the report showed average hourly earnings rose to $11.99 against $11.90 in October, fueling some fears of inflationary pressures down the road.

Remarks by Greenspan saying the Fed must be wary when irrational exuberance affects stocks and assets also contributed to increased speculation.

Traders sold after the comments on the belief that the Fed could raise interest rates in an effort to curb an speculative bubble in the stock market.

Those fears, however, had mostly faded by the end of the day and are not seen as a factor next week.  

"I don't think Greenspan would seriously consider doing that (hike rates to curb a rise in stocks)," said Wayne Ayers, chief economist at Bank of Boston.

"What (Greenspan) attempted to do...was to talk the markets down with words rather than actions. You may hear some more remarks from him going forward because I'm sure he does believe the stock market has become a little too frothy."

The highlights of the economic calendar for next week include the producer price index (PPI) on Wednesday, the consumer price index (CPI) and the retail sales report on Thursday. The three reports are for November.  

In a Reuters survey, overall PPI is seen up 0.3 percent in November. CPI is expected to rise 0.3 percent overall and retail sales are forecast to climb 0.3 percent in November.

From a technical point of view, analysts said the market is likely to consolidate in a fairly wide range between 6.45 and 6.65 percent on the 30-year bond yield.

"We'll probably consolidate for a couple of days," said John Spinello, a managing director at Merrill Lynch.

"But if we don't get any good information or some end-user buying at lower prices ... I think portfolio managers would get more nervous," Spinello added.  

Some position squaring ahead of the end of the year is also expected to take place next week as managers try to adjust portfolions.

Analysts said the market could firm a bit if retailers decided to buy at lower prices instead of selling to protect the profits they already have in their portfolios.

On Friday, the 6-1/2-percent benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 3/32 in late trade at 99-26/32 to yield 6.51 percent. The Federal Reserve refrained from open market operations. Federal funds are seen opening at 5.30 percent on Monday, above the Fed's 5.25 percent target. 212-859-1676
