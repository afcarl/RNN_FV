YPF, Unocal ink term crude deal.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Argentine YPF signed a four-month term contract with Unocal for 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Rincon crude, trade sources said Friday.

Tosco originally held a term contract for 24,000 bpd, but opted not to renew when YPF raised the price, the sources said.

Unocal bid for and was awarded half of Tosco's prior contract volume, paying around February West Texas Intermediate minus 90 cents, around 40 cents higher than Tosco's price, traders said.

YPF is expected to sell the remaining 12,000 bpd on the spot market.

Rincon is a sweet crude with an API gravity of 35.5 degrees.
