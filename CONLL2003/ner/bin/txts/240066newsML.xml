<headline>Testimony on cuts creates tension in Simpson case.</headline>

<p>O.J. Simpson's friend and personal attorney engaged in a shouting match Friday with a plantiffs' lawyer who accused him of changing his testimony about cuts on the former football star's hand.</p>
<p>Tensions rose on what was expected to be the last day of the plaintiffs' case as Leroy &quot;Skip&quot; Taft insisted that when he picked Simpson up at the airport the day after Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were murdered he saw only one cut on the middle finger of Simpson's left hand.</p>
<p>Attorney Daniel Petrocelli, representing Goldman's family, reminded Taft that in his sworn deposition taken earlier this year Simpson's friend of 27 years had recalled seeing two cuts and was not sure about a third.</p>
<p>&quot;How about that, Mr Taft?&quot; Petrocelli demanded on two occasions during the heated exchange, jabbing his finger in the air, after he had apparently tripped up the witness.</p>
<p>Simpson was acquitted in October last year of the June 12, 1994 murders of his ex-wife and Goldman, who were slashed and stabbed to death. He is being sued in a wrongful death case by the families of the victims, who are asking for damages.</p>
<p>Taft said he picked Simpson up at the airport, where he had arrived from Chicago, on June 13, and noticed the middle finger of Simpson's left hand was bandaged. Taft later drove Simpson to Parker Centre, the Los Angeles Police headquarters, where the athlete-turned-actor was interviewed by detectives.</p>
<p>&quot;You saw some cuts on Mr Simpson's left hand. Correct?&quot; Petrocelli asked. &quot;As I sit here today I recall one cut,&quot; Taft replied.</p>
<p>But in Taft's deposition, portions of which Petrocelli read to the jury, he was asked by the attorney, &quot;So you saw a total of three cuts on his hand, his left hand, at Parker Centre on June 13?&quot; Taft replied, &quot;I saw for sure two, I am not sure about that third cut you pointed out in the picture.&quot;</p>
<p>At issue was whether Simpson was lying when he testified earlier in the trial that he had only one cut on his left hand when he returned to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&quot;You understand the importance of saying Mr Simpson only had one cut on his hand, don't you?&quot; Petrocelli pressed Taft. &quot;I understand the importance of coming here to tell the truth today,&quot; Taft replied.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Simpson testified there was only one cut. You knew that?&quot; Petrocelli asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; Taft replied.</p>
<p>Peter Arenella, a law professor who has followed the case closely, said the plaintiffs' attorneys were trying to convince the jury that if Simpson lied about small things he lied about the murders as well.</p>
<p>During his testimony Simpson also denied he had ever struck his ex-wife, even as the jury was shown a picture of a bruised and battered Nicole Brown Simpson. Several witnesses subsequently testified they had seen him slap and hit her.</p>
<p>&quot;At this juncture ... the substance of Mr Simpson's credibility should be in tatters.... If the jury believes Simpson is lying through his teeth about the domestic violence they're probably going to believe he is lying through his teeth about killing Nicole and Goldman,&quot; Arenella said.</p>
<p>Professor Bruce Weir, a world-reknowned statistician who testified in Simpson's criminal trial, presented new statistics in the civil trial on Friday that showed much higher odds against blood in the case coming from anyone other than Simpson, Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman.</p>
<p>Weir said his new figures, as high as 40 billion to one, were arrived at by using using a new equation he had formulated for his calculations. During a spirited cross examination, one of Simpson's defence attorneys, Robert Blasier, accused Weir of trying to damage the defence by coming up with the new figures and said they were wrong.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' attorneys intended to rest their case later on Friday after testimony by Goldman's father, Fred, his mother, Sharon Rufo, and Juditha Brown, Nicole Brown Simpson's mother.</p>
