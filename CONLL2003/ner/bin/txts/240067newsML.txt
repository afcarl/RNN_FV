Fidelity reports "very slight" redemption activity.

BOSTON 1996-12-06

Fidelity Investments said the sharp decline in the stock market Friday spurred a "very slight" number of redemptions in U.S. domestic stock mutual funds.

Fidelity spokesman Scott Beyerl said investor calls to the massive mutual fund company were "slightly higher than on an average Friday."

"People tend to call and ask a lot of questions on a day like this," he said.

Telephone activity has also picked up as the end of the year approaches with investors considering their tax options, he said.

Stocks opened sharply lower Friday, with Dow Jones industrials losing more than 130 points before recovering some ground toward the end of the session to close down 55.16 at 6381.95.

Comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who warned Thursday night about "irrational exuberance" in the financial markets, unsettled the market, analysts said.
