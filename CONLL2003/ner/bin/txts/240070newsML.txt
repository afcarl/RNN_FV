U.S. Southeast power rises on cold, plant outages.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Spot bulk electricity prices in the southeastern U.S. were mostly higher Friday due to the impending colder weather and unscheduled nuclear plant outages, sources said.

Firm, peak power in the northern part of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) territory for weekend delivery traded in the $16.00-17.00 per megawatt hour (MWh) range, while Monday prices were around $25.00.

These prices compare with Thursday's $21.00-22.00 trading range.

TVA was not offering any peak power for Monday delivery, traders said, due to the outage at its 1,148 megawatt (MW) Sequoyah 2 nuclear unit in Soddy-Daisy, Tenn.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said an electrical problem resulted in the loss of two reactor coolant pumps, causing the shutdown.

Firm, off-peak electricity in northern TVA was assessed in the $13.50-15.00 range, mostly unchanged from Thursday.

At the Georgia/Florida border, prices for firm, peak electricity in 16 hour blocks for Monday delivery were quoted mostly steady around $25.00 per MWh.

Firm, off-peak power for Monday at the Ga./Fla. border was still notionally assessed arround $16.00-17.00.

Temperatures in the Southeast are expected to begin dropping late Saturday, with temperatures about three to 10 degrees Fahrenheit below-normal anticipated through next week.

Separately, Duke Power said the 1,129 MW Catawba nuclear power unit in Clover, S.C., will remain off line through the weekend due to a small leak in a reactor coolant pump.
