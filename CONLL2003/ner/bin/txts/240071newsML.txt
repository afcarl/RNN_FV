CBOT rice closes lower on Mexico rice news.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

CBOT rice futures closed lower on concern about the future of U.S. rice exports to Mexico, traders said.

"Word out of Mexico about them importing rice from other than the U.S. has injected some uncertainty in the market," a trader said.

Mexico City sources said Mexico published new rules this week governing rice imports that still favor U.S. grown grains but also pave the way for disease-free Asian varieties to reenter the country.

Rice also met technical resistance levels and sagged.

"Resistance at the $10.70 level checked the market Thursday and today," the trader said.

Rice futures volume was estimated at 500 contracts, below the 588 traded Thursday, according to the CBOT.

Rice futures closed four to five cents per cwt lower, with January down four at $10.65 per cwt.
