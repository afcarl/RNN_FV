U.S. Plains fed cattle market thin at $67 - trade.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets Friday traded in light volume at $67.00 per cwt, down $1.00 from active sales on Tuesday, feedlot sources said.

About 4,000 head sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area, but no sales were reported for Kansas.

An estimated 71,200 head traded in the Panhandle and 90,900 sold in Kansas, USDA said.

Sales this week cleaned out most feedlot showlists, with few yards carrying over cattle into next week, they said.

Many cattle were picked up two to four days after they were sold, according to USDA.  

Prices fell late in the week following steep declines in beef prices, the feedlot sources said. However, some of the possible bearishness for fed cattle prices was offset by this week's large beef movement.

Beef prices at midday were quoted unchanged to down $0.14, with 181 fabricated loads sold, USDA said. The choice heavyweight price was down $0.28 at $108.02, down $6.92 since last Friday.

As of midday, fabricated loads sold were estimated at 1,234 for the week, compared with 827 during last week's Thanksgiving holiday shortened schedule.
