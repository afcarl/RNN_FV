Covol in coal royalty pact, sees 97 profit.

LEHI, Utah 1996-12-06

Covol Technologies Inc said Friday it has executed a pact to receive royalties for each ton of synthetic coal  Savage Industries Inc produces using Covol's patented technology.

The company said the pact and two other agreements reached this year should bring it a profit in fiscal 1997.

"We will be profitable in fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and our projections will show that," said corporate counsel Asael Sorensen. "We're going from a developmental company to an operating company, and we fully expect to be showing profits in this next fiscal year."  

The company expects to report a loss this year ending September 30, Chief Operating Officer Alan Ayers said.

Covol shares closed Friday off 1/8 at 12-7/8.

Covol's technology converts coal fines, particles of coal 1/4 inch or smaller, into a solid, synthetic fuel.

In November Arthur J Gallagher & Co signed a letter of intent to buy Covol's Utah coal processing facility for a $2.5 million down payment and quarterly payments for the life of the project.  

That month Covol also agreed to enter a joint venture with a PacifiCorp subsidiary to build and run a coal fines processing facility in Alabama to produce 360,000 tons of synthetic coal briquettes a year.

Under terms of the most recent agreement, Savage Industries will use Covol's technology at an existing facility that will undergo modifications and become operational in the second quarter 1997.

Covol said it also has another agreement with Savage for joint ventures at two more sites using its technology.
