MGE spring wheat ends higher in commercial buying.

MINNEAPOLIS 1996-12-06

MGE spring wheat futures ended higher amid commercial buying and a lack of hedge-related selling, traders said.

"We saw good commercial buying, with Cargill the featured buyer in all three (U.S. wheat markets)," an MGE trader said. "Atwood-Peavey (bought) the Dec contract late."

Cargill's purchases raised talk of fresh export business in the works, but some traders were skeptical.

"Cargill's a big cash short and is still short the futures, and they really just needed to cover those positions. That's my opinion," one trader said.

MGE spring wheat closed one to 9-3/4 cents per bushel higher, with Dec up 9-3/4 cents at $4.30, just off the intraday high of $4.31. March gained 3-3/4 cents to close at $3.81-1/2.

Traders said CIS bought at least two million March bushels and Benson-Quinn bought one million March.

MGE barley closed two to three cents per cwt higher, with March up three cents at $6.53. Dec did not trade.
