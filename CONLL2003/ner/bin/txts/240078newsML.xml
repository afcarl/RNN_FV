<p>The U.S. State Department said Friday it saw no need to change its Middle East policy and rejected calls by former Secretary of State James Baker that it should take a tougher line on Jewish settlements.</p>
<p>Saying that &quot;we care more about progress than soundbites,&quot; spokesman Nicholas Burns argued that despite a slowdown this year in the Middle East peace process, the U.S. policy of discreet mediation was continuing to produce results.</p>
<p>Baker, who left office in 1992, called at a Washington seminar Thursday for the Clinton administration to take a stronger role to boost Middle East peace talks and accused it of failing to speak out on Jewish settlements.</p>
<p>&quot;I disagree with these statements that (Baker) made yesterday,&quot; Burns told a news briefing. &quot;Over the last four years, more progress has been made in the Middle East peace process than any time since the late 1940s.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is that the United States has been able to be an effective intermediary between the Palestinians and the Israelis because we are discreet, because we are constructive, because we don't play to the crowds,...because we care more about progress than about soundbites,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The question...that maybe Secretary Baker asked is -- well, because of the frustrations and the slowing down, do you change policy? Do you adopt a different tactical approach, and our view at this point is no,&quot; Burns said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the policy is working, don't break it to try to fix it. We're doing the right thing. We have the right policy,&quot; he said, speaking a day after President Bill Clinton named a new secretary of state, U.N. ambassador Madeleine Albright.</p>
<p>Since the election of right-winger Benjamin Netanyahu as Israeli Prime Minister six months ago, Israeli-Palestinian talks have made little headway. The sides have been haggling since October over a deal on the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>Burns said the fact that talks were continuing represented progress. He said the United States expected a Hebron accord, and Israelis and Palestinians were already talking about future &quot;final status&quot; negotiations on Palestinian self-rule.</p>
<p>&quot;So despite our frustrations and the clear frustrations of the Palestinians and some Israelis...we believe that the situation continues to move forward -- perhaps more slowly than in 1995 or 1994, but it continues to move,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>PLO negotiators said on Friday that Netanyahu, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak might all meet on Saturday to try to clinch a deal on Israel's handover of Hebron to the PLO.</p>
<p>Burns rejected suggestions that the United States should use stronger language on settlements, which Netanyahu's government has begun expanding. Washington was satisfied with its description of them as a &quot;complicating factor,&quot; he said.</p>
