NYPA sees 825 MW N.Y. power plant on line Monday.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

The New York Power Authority (NYPA) said it planned to place the 825 megawatt fossil-fired Poletti generating station on line Monday.

The plant in Queens County, N.Y., had been in reserve shutdown since October.

A utility usually puts a generating unit, especially those that run on higher-priced fuels such as fuel oil and natural gas, on standby status during periods of modest demand.

A plant in reserve shutdown could be fired up within 72 hours.

NYPA generates one fourth of the electricity produced in the state of New York.
