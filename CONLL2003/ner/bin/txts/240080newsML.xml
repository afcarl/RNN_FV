<p>President Bill Clinton plans to meet Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian when he visits the White House on Tuesday in spite of his role in the crushing of the 1989 pro-democracy protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said on Friday the Tiananmen Square crackdown would never be considered &quot;irrelevant&quot; by the U.S. government but that Chi's visit was important to a stable security relationship between the United States and China.</p>
<p>&quot;Because he is defense minister he is in a position where he is responsible for supervising the type of military-to-military contacts that we believe are in the best interests of the people of the United States&quot; and its security, McCurry told reporters.</p>
<p>Chi, who arrived in the United States on Thursday for a 10-day fence-mending visit, was chief of the general staff during the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen massacre, in which hundreds of people were believed to have been killed.</p>
<p>He is to hold meetings in Washington on Monday and Tuesday. In addition to Clinton he is to meet senior White House officials on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Tiananmen Square crackdown sent U.S.-Sino relations into a tailspin from which they have never fully recovered.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, however, U.S. and Chinese leaders have moved to improve ties with a visit to Beijing by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and talks between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Clinton at a meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders in the Philippines last month.</p>
<p>A brief U.S. government profile of Chi prepared for the visit made no mention of his role at Tiananmen Square. But a U.S. intelligence official, citing the &quot;full intelligence record,&quot; said Chi was neither the architect nor the driving force behind the crackdown, which the official said was the work of political leaders.</p>
<p>McCurry said the Tiananmen crackdown decision was &quot;clearly taken at the highest levels of the Chinese government.&quot;</p>
<p>Defense Secretary William Perry and Chi are to discuss bilateral military issues, as well as global and Asia-Pacific security matters, China's official Xinhua news agency has said.</p>
