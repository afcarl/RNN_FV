CBOT soyoil ends up on firm cash, spreads unwind.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

CBOT soyoil futures closed higher on commercial and fund buying, firm cash markets and unwinding of the soymeal/soyoil spreads, traders said.

"It's a correction of oil/meal spreads and seasonal..it's doing what it's supposed to do," a trader said.

Traders said cash soyoil markets were firm and soymeal markets were weak.

U.S. exporters Thursday cited tight nearby stocks.

"Things are pretty tight down there (Gulf) right now," one cash source said. "I'm not sure the tightness will last, but they're having trouble loading right now."

Pressure came from an aggressive crush pace.

The National Oilseeds Processors Association (NOPA) weekly soy crush report showed 30.213 million bushels crushed during the week ended December 4, near the top end of expectations for 29.5 to 30.62 million bushels.

Soyoil closed 0.05 to 0.18 cent per lb higher, with December up 0.12 at 23.17. Soymeal closed $2.40 per ton lower to $1.00 higher, with December down $1.40 at $233.20.

Cargill Inc bought 500 lots of January soyoil and sold 700 January and sold 500 March, traders said. Rosenthal Collins bought 600 January and Griffin Trading bought 300 January, they said.

Soyoil futures volume was estimated at 25,000 contracts, below the 25,541 traded Thursday, according to the CBOT.

Soymeal futures volume was estimated at 21,000 contracts, below the 34,961 traded Thursday.
