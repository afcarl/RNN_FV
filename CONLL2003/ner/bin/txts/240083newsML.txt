Possis Medical Inc said Friday it plans to file next year for regulatory approval to market its AngioJet blood-clot-removal system for use in the arms, legs and heart.

"For the coronary use, our current plans are we hope to complete our clinical trials during this coming calendar year. So we would be submitting hopefully in 1997," Robert Dutcher president, said in a telephone interview. "I would hope that we would be able to apply to expand the claims in the peripheral sense (arms and legs) before that."  

Shares of the Minneapolis-based company on Friday hit a new 52-week high of $22 a share as the firm, long considered a development-stage company, savored its first regulatory breakthrough, analysts said.

On Friday afternoon, shares were off 1/8 at 19-5/8.

Earlier Friday, Possis said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration okayed marketing of its AngioJet to remove blood clots from grafts used by kidney dialysis patients.

Grafts are artificial blood vessels implanted into kidney dialysis patients to ease their frequent exchange of blood. After a period of time, many grafts form blood clots.  

The company said its technology gives a cutting-edge alternative to surgery or drugs to remove blood clots from natural blood vessels and grafts throughout the body.

"As far as I know, this would be the state-of-the-art... and we are on the leading edge of being able to provide devices that can deal with bloodclots," Dutcher added.

Analysts said even the narrow regulatory nod -- only for clots specifically for grafts and not peripheral or coronary use -- represented a big step forward for the medical device company.  

"Of the people that we've talked to, I think that technology still holds considerable promise," said Dain Bosworth analyst Parice Halbert. "It's good news for them. They've been working for quite a bit of time on it."

"This is big positive for Possis, in my opinion, and it's also a very exciting device for the medical community," added Douglas Eayrs, senior healthcare analyst, John Kinnard & Co.

He said that the new technology appears best suited for rapid removal of fresh clots rather than for treatment of clots that formed over time from plaque buildup.

Earyes also said although FDA okayed limited AngioJet use, it okayed two different sizes of the catheters. Doctors now could use the smaller catheter in non-approved ways, such as in the heart, in life-threatening situations.

Halbert said she looked for the company to generate fiscal 1997 revenues of $7.8 million, with $6.6 million coming from the AngioJet system.

Earyes projected $10.3 million revenues for the year ending July 31, 1997, compared to $1.6 million in the 1996 year. He said the AngioJet system in the next six to seven months could contribute $6 million or $7 million to revenues.
