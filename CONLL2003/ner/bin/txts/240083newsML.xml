<p>Possis Medical Inc said Friday it plans to file next year for regulatory approval to market its AngioJet blood-clot-removal system for use in the arms, legs and heart.</p>
<p>&quot;For the coronary use, our current plans are we hope to complete our clinical trials during this coming calendar year. So we would be submitting hopefully in 1997,&quot; Robert Dutcher president, said in a telephone interview. &quot;I would hope that we would be able to apply to expand the claims in the peripheral sense (arms and legs) before that.&quot;  </p>
<p>Shares of the Minneapolis-based company on Friday hit a new 52-week high of $22 a share as the firm, long considered a development-stage company, savored its first regulatory breakthrough, analysts said.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, shares were off 1/8 at 19-5/8.</p>
<p>Earlier Friday, Possis said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration okayed marketing of its AngioJet to remove blood clots from grafts used by kidney dialysis patients.</p>
<p>Grafts are artificial blood vessels implanted into kidney dialysis patients to ease their frequent exchange of blood. After a period of time, many grafts form blood clots.  </p>
<p>The company said its technology gives a cutting-edge alternative to surgery or drugs to remove blood clots from natural blood vessels and grafts throughout the body.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as I know, this would be the state-of-the-art... and we are on the leading edge of being able to provide devices that can deal with bloodclots,&quot; Dutcher added.</p>
<p>Analysts said even the narrow regulatory nod -- only for clots specifically for grafts and not peripheral or coronary use -- represented a big step forward for the medical device company.  </p>
<p>&quot;Of the people that we've talked to, I think that technology still holds considerable promise,&quot; said Dain Bosworth analyst Parice Halbert. &quot;It's good news for them. They've been working for quite a bit of time on it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is big positive for Possis, in my opinion, and it's also a very exciting device for the medical community,&quot; added Douglas Eayrs, senior healthcare analyst, John Kinnard &amp; Co.</p>
<p>He said that the new technology appears best suited for rapid removal of fresh clots rather than for treatment of clots that formed over time from plaque buildup.</p>
<p>Earyes also said although FDA okayed limited AngioJet use, it okayed two different sizes of the catheters. Doctors now could use the smaller catheter in non-approved ways, such as in the heart, in life-threatening situations.</p>
<p>Halbert said she looked for the company to generate fiscal 1997 revenues of $7.8 million, with $6.6 million coming from the AngioJet system.</p>
<p>Earyes projected $10.3 million revenues for the year ending July 31, 1997, compared to $1.6 million in the 1996 year. He said the AngioJet system in the next six to seven months could contribute $6 million or $7 million to revenues.</p>
