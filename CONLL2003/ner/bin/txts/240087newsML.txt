CBOT corn ends lower amid Dow jitters, soy drop.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

CBOT corn futures closed lower amid nervousness about gyrations in the Dow Industrial stock average with a late drop in soybeans lending pressure, traders said.

There were few fresh features with pressure coming from a setback after Thursday's late short-covering rally, they said.

"Yesterday was overdone and there was just not enough steam to keep it going," said Ron Kucha of O'Connor and Co. "The stock market wasn't as bad as thought."

The Dow dropped early by roughly 140 points but by 1445 CST was down a more modest 60 points at roughly 6376.

Slow farmer selling underpinned the market but the volume was thin with gains in the wheat and soyoil futures keeping a floor under the market.

Cargill Inc bought two million bushels of March and Refco Inc sold two million March and two million May, traders said.

Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 58,000 contracts, below the 77,899 traded Thursday. Corn options volume was estimated at 18,000 contracts, below the 20,921 traded Thursday.

Corn closed 1/4 to 1-1/4 cents per bushel lower, with December down 1-1/4 at $2.67-1/4.
