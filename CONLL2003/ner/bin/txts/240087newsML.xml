<headline>CBOT corn ends lower amid Dow jitters, soy drop.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBOT corn futures closed lower amid nervousness about gyrations in the Dow Industrial stock average with a late drop in soybeans lending pressure, traders said.</p>
<p>There were few fresh features with pressure coming from a setback after Thursday's late short-covering rally, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday was overdone and there was just not enough steam to keep it going,&quot; said Ron Kucha of O'Connor and Co. &quot;The stock market wasn't as bad as thought.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dow dropped early by roughly 140 points but by 1445 CST was down a more modest 60 points at roughly 6376.</p>
<p>Slow farmer selling underpinned the market but the volume was thin with gains in the wheat and soyoil futures keeping a floor under the market.</p>
<p>Cargill Inc bought two million bushels of March and Refco Inc sold two million March and two million May, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 58,000 contracts, below the 77,899 traded Thursday. Corn options volume was estimated at 18,000 contracts, below the 20,921 traded Thursday.</p>
<p>Corn closed 1/4 to 1-1/4 cents per bushel lower, with December down 1-1/4 at $2.67-1/4.</p>
