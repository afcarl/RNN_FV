Boeing considers raising 737 production.

RENTON, Wash. 1996-12-06

The Boeing Co is considering raising monthly production of its 737 model well beyond the level of 17 a month announced for late 1997, a company executive said Friday.

Bruce Dennis, vice president of marketing for Boeing's commercial airplane group, said the manufacturer was seeking ways to expand capacity beyond the previous peak of 21 jets monthly.

"We are looking at higher rates of production, but quite frankly we don't know what the max rate of production is," Dennis said at a briefing in advance of roll-out ceremonies for the next-generation version of the plane.

Boeing already has announced plans to double 737 production by next year's third quarter from its current level of 8.5 monthly to meet rising demand.

"There is a lot of confidence in the market out there right now," Dennis said. "Overall the fundamentals look good."
