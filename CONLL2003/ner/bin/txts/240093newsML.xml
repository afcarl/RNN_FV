<title>USA: KCBT wheat ends firm but off intraday highs.</title>
<headline>KCBT wheat ends firm but off intraday highs.</headline>
<dateline>KANSAS CITY, Mo. 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>KCBT hard red winter wheat futures ended firmer on short-covering and a spree of commercial buying, but late profit taking took the market off its intraday highs, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market strengthened on short covering in the Dec and on commercial buying in the March. Kansas City led Chicago up on this rally, allowing us to widen the (intermarket) spread with Chicago,&quot; a trader said. &quot;We pared our gains late -- I think it was some pre-weekend profit taking.&quot;</p>
<p>KCBT wheat closed 1/2 to 11 cents per bushel higher, with Dec up 11 cents at $4.54 -- its highest close since September.</p>
<p>March gained 5-1/2 cents to close at $4.01-1/2, off the intraday high of $4.05.</p>
<p>Traders said wheat values drew support from forecasts of rains in Argentine growing regions, and also from news Turkey and the U.S. resolved issues that had blocked U.S. exports of wheat over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>The deal will likely clear the way for the U.S. to compete in next week's Turkish tender for 200,000 tonnes of wheat.</p>
<p>Traders said Cargill was the featured buyer, picking up at least 4 million March bushels. Cargill also was a big buyer in Chicago. Term Commodities legged the Dec/March spread late.</p>
