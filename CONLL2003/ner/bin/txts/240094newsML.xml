<title>USA: CBOT soybeans close lower on fund sales, Dow drop.</title>
<headline>CBOT soybeans close lower on fund sales, Dow drop.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBOT soybean futures closed lower on fund selling amid jitters about declines in the Dow Industrial stock average and other outside markets, traders said.</p>
<p>But traders said the declines in the Dow were much less than expected which limited the slide in soy.</p>
<p>&quot;We had an eye on the stock market today but it came back and took some of the pressure off. It wasn't very dramatic. All the action was in the other room (CBOT T-Bond pit),&quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
<p>End-of-the-week profit taking was cited.</p>
<p>Soybeans rallied late Thursday on short covering including a short covering rally in soyoil but there was a lack of followthrough Friday.</p>
<p>The Dow Industrial average dropped sharply early, by roughly 140 points, but by the afternoon had recovered to trade with a more modest 50 point loss.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone was looking for some gloom and doom but it wasn't that bad,&quot; said Ron Kucha of O'Connor and Co.</p>
<p>Soybeans closed 1/2 to six cents per bushel lower, with January down six at $6.96. March was down 5-1/4 at $6.92.  </p>
<p>Cargill Inc bought 2.5 million January and sold 2.5 million January, traders said. Smith Barney sold 3.5 million January and sold 2.5 million January, they said.</p>
<p>Soybean futures volume was estimated at 48,000 contracts, below the 61,735 traded Thursday, according to the CBOT.</p>
<p>In soybean options, Tenco Inc bought 400 January $7.00 calls at seven to eight cents and Smith Barney sold 500 March $7.50 calls at five cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Soybean options volume was estimated at 15,000 contracts, below the 19,430 traded Thursday.</p>
