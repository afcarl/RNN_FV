Ex-Chicago 7 radical Hayden for LA mayor?.

LOS ANGELES 1996-12-06

Tom Hayden, the former 1960s radical activist and veteran Democratic state legislator, has decided to enter the race for Los Angeles mayor, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday.

The newspaper cited several anonymous sources as saying Hayden, once married to actress Jane Fonda, will challenge Republican incumbent Richard Riordan in next April's election.

Hayden declined to specify when he would file papers to get on the ballot, but was quoted as saying he was "definitely moving in that direction."

Riordan, a millionaire businessman expected by most observers to handily win re-election, told the Times a Hayden candidacy would be "interesting."

But a Republican political consultant, Allen Hoffenblum, cautioned Riordan not to take Hayden lightly, considering Los Angeles is a heavily Democratic city and Riordan was the first Republican to be elected mayor in modern times.

Hayden, 56, while a student at the University of Michigan in the early 1960s, helped launch the civil rights and anti-Vietnam war group, Students for a Democratic Society.

He played a key role organizing the ultimately violent protests at the 1968 Democratic Convention, where he was arrested and put on trial as one of the "Chicago 7."

He was elected to the California state assembly in 1982 and the state senate 10 years later. During that time he married Fonda, herself a controversial radical political figure during the Vietnam War-era. They were divorced several years ago.

In 14 years in Sacramento, Hayden has focused on fighting political corruption and supporting environmental issues. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 1976 and for California governor two years ago. He has written several books.
