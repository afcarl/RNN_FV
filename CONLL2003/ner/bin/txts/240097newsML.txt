NYCE cotton settles firmer after sluggish session.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

NYCE cotton futures settled firmer but turnover was subdued and largely rangebound, traders said.

A floor source said many of the large players had already closed their trading books for the year, with activity left to locals and occasional speculators.

March settled up 0.51 cent at 76.11 cents per pound, traded 76.15 to 75.30 cents.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its December supply and demand report on Thursday, Dec 12. Industry sources expect the USDA to raise its estimate for the U.S. crop, which was pegged at 18.59 million 480-lb bales in November.

Volume on Friday was estimated at 7,000 lots, barely changed from Thursday's official 7,359 lots.
