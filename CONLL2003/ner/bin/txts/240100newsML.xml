<headline>National carlot beef trade weekly review - USDA.</headline>
<dateline>DES MOINES 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Boxed beef traded lower on moderate to fairly strong demand and heavy offerings, USDA said. Retail demand was fairly good for immediate post-holiday needs, but at sharply lower prices for most Choice cuts, especially the chuck and round cuts.</p>
<p>The Choice rib and loin cuts also traded lower with the most pressure noted for immediate post-holiday needs. The Select cuts, generally lower, were under pressure also.</p>
<p>Closely trimmed items followed somewhat same pattern. Choice cuts were under the most pressure, sharply lower, and the Select cuts were weak.  </p>
<p>Beef trimmings traded lower on good demand and heavy offerings. Fed cattle and blended coarse ground items were uneven, with the Fed cattle grinds under the most pressure and traded lower as the week progressed on light to moderate demand and offerings.</p>
<p>For the week - Select and Choice rib primal 2.50 to 6.50 lower; Select and Choice chuck primal 2.50 to 7.00 lower; Select and Choice round primal 2.50 to 8.50 lower; Select and Choice loin primal 3.00 to 7.00 lower; Closely trimmed items 2.50 to 7.50 lower; Beef trimmings 5.00 lower; Fed cattle and blended coarse ground items generally steady to 3.00 lower.</p>
<p>The Estimated Composite of Boxed Beef Cutout values of Choice 1-3 550/700 carcasses Dn 7.57 at 110.04; 700/850 Dn 6.64 at 108.30; Select 1-3 550/700 carcasses Dn 3.43 at 94.26; 700/850 Dn 2.86 at 92.87.</p>
<p>COW AND BULL CARCASS, BONELESS PROCESSING BEEF, CUTTER COW CUTOUT Slaughter cow numbers were moderate to heavy, which resulted in an increase of lean boneless beef supplies, in the upper Midwest. Consequently, prices eroded this week even though demand was moderate to fairly good, especially from the sausage grinders as competing proteins were limited in formulations. However, in the Texas area, cow numbers were light and caused boneless beef offerings to decrease, resulting in steady price levels.</p>
<p>In addition, Cutter cow carcasses prices declined after last week's increases, due to heavy supplies. On the other hand Utility carcasses moved at steady levels. The cow cuts market was mostly weak to lower, with the exception of tenderloins which were steady and 100 percent lean flats and eyes were firm due to increased demand because of the government buying program.</p>
<p>Utility carcasses steady; Cutter 2.00-3.00 lower; Fresh 90% boneless beef 1.50-2.00 lower in the Midwest, Texas generally steady; 85% generally steady to weak; 75% 1.50 lower; 65% 2.50-4.00 lower. The Cutter cow carcass gross cut-out value for Thursday, December 5, 1996 was estimated at 64.70 per cwt., down 1.32 from a week ago Friday.</p>
