Spot wholesale electricity prices in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) eased Friday along with lower spot natural gas prices, industry sources said.

Spot natural gas prices in Texas were said to have eased about 20 cents on Friday to near $3.50 per million British thermal units, and electricity followed behind, the brokers and marketers said.

Non-firm peak ERCOT power was pegged steady at $27.00-29.00.

Firm off-peak ERCOT power transactions were pegged lower at $11.00-14.00 from $16.00-18.00, the sources said, while non-firm off-peak ERCOT power was assessed lower at $7.00-11.00 from $13.00-15.00 per MWh on Thursday.

ERCOT January/February peak power prices were said to have fallen off after Thursday's jump to $31.75-32.25 from $33.50-34.50, the sources said.

July/August ERCOT power was said to be trading near $26.00.
