<p>ERCOT firm, peak power for weekend and Monday delivery was pegged at $29.00-31.00 from $31.00-33.00 per megawatt hour (MWh) on Thursday, the sources said.</p>
<p>Non-firm peak ERCOT power was pegged steady at $27.00-29.00.</p>
<p>Firm off-peak ERCOT power transactions were pegged lower at $11.00-14.00 from $16.00-18.00, the sources said, while non-firm off-peak ERCOT power was assessed lower at $7.00-11.00 from $13.00-15.00 per MWh on Thursday.</p>
<p>ERCOT January/February peak power prices were said to have fallen off after Thursday's jump to $31.75-32.25 from $33.50-34.50, the sources said.</p>
