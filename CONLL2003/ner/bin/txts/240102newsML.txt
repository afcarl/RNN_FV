CBOT wheat closes higher on Cargill buying.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

CBOT wheat futures closed higher on commercial buying, especially demand by Cargill Inc.

Traders said the key commercial firm bought four million bushels of March wheat in Chicago, 2.5 million bushels each of KCBT March and May and also bought at least 1.5 million bushels of MGE spring wheat futures.

The Cargill buying spurred talk that there may be some export business brewing but there were no fresh export rumors that surfaced.

"It was just Cargill back and forth," a trader said.

Though there were no export rumors some traders pointed to an agreement between Turkey and the U.S. involving issues which have blocked U.S. exports of wheat to Turkey as bullish.

Term Commodities, the marketing arm of Louis Dreyfus Corp, also was a key purchaser of one million bushels of March and LIT America bought one million March, traders said.

There also were perceiptions of domestic mill stopping of the deliveries posted Thursday and Friday against the December contract, the traders said.

Wheat closed unchanged to 6-1/4 cents per bushel higher, with December up 6-1/4 at $3.91.

Some again cited talk Egypt would be in the market Saturday for up to 500,000 tonnes of wheat but many remained skeptical the U.S. would land any of the business.
