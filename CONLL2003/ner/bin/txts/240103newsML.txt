Muni bond insurers say Miami default is unlikely.

MIAMI 1996-12-06

The three firms that insure Miami's municipal bonds were closely monitoring the city's budget crisis, but said Friday a default was unlikely.

The city is struggling to close a $68 million deficit in its budget for the year that began Oct 1. Earlier this week, Gov Lawton Chiles declared Miami to have a fiscal emergency and said he would appoint an advisory panel to oversee recovery efforts.

Miami had about $593 million of bond debt outstanding, including principle and interest, at the end of fiscal 1995.

None of the bond insurers would comment on the extent of their exposure, but only about $15 million of Miami's bonds are uninsured.

Financial Guaranty Insurance Co, believed to be the biggest insurer of Miami paper, declined to comment except to say that it had met with state officials and would meet next week with city officials.

The other two firms that insure Miami bonds, AMBAC Indemnity Corp, a unit of AMBAC Inc and MBIA Insurance Corp, a unit of MBIA Inc said a default was unlikely.

"I see a lot of not probably good news, but I don't foresee at all a default," said Joseph Salzano, AMBAC executive vice president and head of public finance. "I don't think that Florida can afford to have Miami to default and I can't imagine the state allowing Miami to go into bankruptcy."

MBIA vice president Mike Ballinger agreed, saying, "We believe the city will not default on any of its debt obligations and are encouraged by the close cooperation between the city and the state to resolve the situation."

Representatives of all three firms were scheduled to meet in Miami on Wednesday with City Manager Ed Marquez.
