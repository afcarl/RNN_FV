<headline>AMR says UK recommendations are not &quot;deal breaker&quot;.</headline>

<p>AMR Corp, which was told it must meet certain conditions before its proposed alliance with British Airways Plc would be approved, said it did not view the terms as a &quot;deal breaker.&quot;</p>
<p>The parent of American Airlines, however, called the conditions &quot;more severe&quot; than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances.  </p>
<p>American denied industry speculation that slot concessions or other restrictions would kill the proposed deal.</p>
<p>But American's Chairman Robert Crandall said in a statement that &quot;excessive restrictions&quot; would jeopardize the economics of the alliance and endanger the prospects for new anglo-U.S. &quot;open skies&quot; air treaty.  </p>
<p>The British government said on Friday that the airlines must drop 168 slots a week at London Heathrow airport and reduce services on the London to Dallas Fort Worth route. BA would also be required to drop a clause in its pact with USAir Group Inc that prevents USAir from competing on transatlantic routes.</p>
<p>U.K. regulators said that, even if the conditions are met by both carriers, final approval still hinges on a new open skies treay that would generate greater competition on transatlantic routes.</p>
<p>American Airlines said it was pleased the British Department of Trade and Industry issued its preliminary decision on the alliance and that the deal will not be referred to additional regulators for more study.</p>
<p>But American said further discussion is needed to understand the details on the slot transfers and other matters.</p>
<p>British Airways said on Friday that such a move on slots would be &quot;unprecedented.&quot;</p>
<p>BA also said it would take &quot;reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition.&quot;</p>
