U.S. Northeast power mixed on outage, line return.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Spot bulk electricity prices in the New York area were flat to lower Friday on returns of a high-voltage transmission line and a nuclear power plant from repairs, market sources said.

News of a shutdown of the 910 megawatt (MW) Maine Yankee nuclear plant pushed spot prices in the New England higher.

"The transmission line came online yesterday. That made the difference," a New York trader said, referring to a 345 kilovolt (KV) line that runs between Utica and Albany, N.Y.

The transmission line, which was shut Monday, returned to operation earlier than expected, It was planned to resume service this afternoon.

Niagara Mohawk Power Co, which operates the line, could not immediately be reached to confirm the return of the high-voltage line.

The line outage cut capacity at the Central-East Interface by 1,000 megawatt (MW). That transmission junction could usually carry 2,600-2,700 MW.

Output at the 1,137 megawatt (MW) Nine Mile Point nuclear power unit 2 in Scriba, N.Y., was trimmed overnight to repair a circulation pump. In the past couple of days, there were unconfirmed talks that the unit may shut next week.

Although natural gas prices fell sharply today, it was not a contributing factor to the decline in power prices because most New York utilities considered residual oil cheaper than natural gas as a boiler fuel at their generating plants.

"I don't see how's that going to affect anything," the New York trader said.

In the eastern portion of the New York Power Pool (NYPP), trading of peak, non-firm electricity for Monday was pegged near $28.00 a megawatt hour (MWh), down from Thursday's $31.00-$34.00.

Off-peak, non-firm power for Monday in eastern NYPP remained steady at $19.00-$20.00.

In the western NYPP, peak, non-firm electricity prices for Monday were supported by stronger next-day prices down at the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnect pool.

Western NYPP power for peak, non-firm delivery on Monday was quoted at $23.00-$23.50, a tighter range than Thursday's $23.00-$25.00, and stayed flat for Monday off-peak, non-firm delivery at $14.50-$15.00.

Spot power prices in the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL), peak, non-firm electricity for Monday at the Northeast Utilities border jumped to $36.00-$37.00, up from Thursday's $31.00-$33.00 for Friday.

Non-firm, off-peak NEPOOL power for Monday delivery to the NU border was assessed at $20.00-$21.00, up from $19.50-$20.50 Thursday.

The Maine Yankee generating station was shut early Friday to correct cable routing problems associated with two cables serving the main control room.

Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co did not set a restart for the Wiscasset, Maine, nuclear plant. The length of the shutdown would be determined pending a review of the plant's circuitry.

Saturday's temperatures in most of the Northeast were predicted to peak in 20-40s Fahrenheit and bottom in the teens to 30s. A cooling trend was expected with temperatures staying slightly below normal next week.
