<title>USA: U.S. Northeast power mixed on outage, line return.</title>
<headline>U.S. Northeast power mixed on outage, line return.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Spot bulk electricity prices in the New York area were flat to lower Friday on returns of a high-voltage transmission line and a nuclear power plant from repairs, market sources said.</p>
<p>News of a shutdown of the 910 megawatt (MW) Maine Yankee nuclear plant pushed spot prices in the New England higher.</p>
<p>&quot;The transmission line came online yesterday. That made the difference,&quot; a New York trader said, referring to a 345 kilovolt (KV) line that runs between Utica and Albany, N.Y.</p>
<p>The transmission line, which was shut Monday, returned to operation earlier than expected, It was planned to resume service this afternoon.</p>
<p>Niagara Mohawk Power Co, which operates the line, could not immediately be reached to confirm the return of the high-voltage line.</p>
<p>The line outage cut capacity at the Central-East Interface by 1,000 megawatt (MW). That transmission junction could usually carry 2,600-2,700 MW.</p>
<p>Output at the 1,137 megawatt (MW) Nine Mile Point nuclear power unit 2 in Scriba, N.Y., was trimmed overnight to repair a circulation pump. In the past couple of days, there were unconfirmed talks that the unit may shut next week.</p>
<p>Although natural gas prices fell sharply today, it was not a contributing factor to the decline in power prices because most New York utilities considered residual oil cheaper than natural gas as a boiler fuel at their generating plants.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see how's that going to affect anything,&quot; the New York trader said.</p>
<p>In the eastern portion of the New York Power Pool (NYPP), trading of peak, non-firm electricity for Monday was pegged near $28.00 a megawatt hour (MWh), down from Thursday's $31.00-$34.00.</p>
<p>Off-peak, non-firm power for Monday in eastern NYPP remained steady at $19.00-$20.00.</p>
<p>In the western NYPP, peak, non-firm electricity prices for Monday were supported by stronger next-day prices down at the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnect pool.</p>
<p>Western NYPP power for peak, non-firm delivery on Monday was quoted at $23.00-$23.50, a tighter range than Thursday's $23.00-$25.00, and stayed flat for Monday off-peak, non-firm delivery at $14.50-$15.00.</p>
<p>Spot power prices in the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL), peak, non-firm electricity for Monday at the Northeast Utilities border jumped to $36.00-$37.00, up from Thursday's $31.00-$33.00 for Friday.</p>
<p>Non-firm, off-peak NEPOOL power for Monday delivery to the NU border was assessed at $20.00-$21.00, up from $19.50-$20.50 Thursday.</p>
<p>The Maine Yankee generating station was shut early Friday to correct cable routing problems associated with two cables serving the main control room.</p>
<p>Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co did not set a restart for the Wiscasset, Maine, nuclear plant. The length of the shutdown would be determined pending a review of the plant's circuitry.</p>
<p>Saturday's temperatures in most of the Northeast were predicted to peak in 20-40s Fahrenheit and bottom in the teens to 30s. A cooling trend was expected with temperatures staying slightly below normal next week.</p>
