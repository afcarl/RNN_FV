US Midwest hog prices seen steady-off $0.50-trade.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices for Monday were seen steady to $0.50 per cwt lower, pressured by ongoing weak pork prices, dealers said.

Pork prices were pressured by increased production following last week's holiday-shortened slaughter schedule.

Top prices for hogs delivered to the plant in Iowa and southern Minnesota could range $57.00-$57.50, they said.

Illinois top prices for hogs at the plant could range $56.50 to $57.00 and Indiana/Ohio top plant prices for hogs could range from $56.00 to $56.50, the dealers said.  

USDA estimated hog slaughter for the week to date at 1.810 million head, up 17.0 percent from last week, but down 5.4 percent from a year ago.

Fresh loin prices at midday were quoted mostly $4.00 per cwt lower, hams were $2.00 lower, bellies mostly $2.00 to $3.00 lower and lean trimmings $3.00 lower, USDA said.

Pork trading was slow to moderate and demand light against moderate offerings, USDA said. There were 38.5 loads of pork and 9.0 loads of pork trimmings sold.
