WORLD BONDS -- U.S. players still bullish on Italy.

Italian bonds produced some of the best returns of any government bond market this year, and still look attractive heading into 1997, U.S. analysts said.

"We still like Italy," said Peter Petas, sovereign debt analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc. "It offers the highest yields of any European bond market and the fundamentals are still very positive."

Italian bond bulls say prices of both short- and long-term Italian fixed-income instruments are likely to rise in 1997, offering investors two ways to bet on the market.  

Ben Ghalmi, European market analyst at Alliance Capital Management Corp says three- to five-year Italian bonds look particuarly attractive becuase this sector does not fully reflect the continuing decline in Italian inflation and the monetary policy easing this will trigger.

Given the low levels of inflation in Italy and the recent strength of the lira, Ghalmi expects the Bank of Italy (BOI) to ease short-term interest rates by 75 basis points over the next six months and possibly an additional 50 basis points afterwards.  

He believes spreads between three- to five-year Italian bonds and similar-maturity German bunds are likely to tighten by 40-50 basis points as the BOI cuts rates.

Ghalmi is also positive about prospects for longer-term Italian bonds. "The long-end has done a lot already (in 1996), but there is more to go. While there may be some potential bumps in road, such as with the political envirnonment, the long-term view is contructive."  

As Italy makes progress toward meeting the economic requirements for entry into the Europen Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), spreads on long-term Italian bonds should continue to tighten in 1997, analysts said.

"We don't think Italy will be included in the first round of countries to join the EMU in 1999, but nonetheless, the fact that they are taking practical steps to reduce their budget deficit will cause the trend of tightening to continue in 1997," says Peter Plaut, sovereign bond analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.

Salomon economists believe spreads on Italian 10-year bonds relative to 10-year bunds will tighten to 150 basis points from their current levels of around 190 basis points over the next 12 months.

"When the EMU occurs, there won't be any more currency risk in Europe--it will all be a credit game. At their current levels, Italian bonds have a long way to go before the currency risk is factored out," said Plaut.

He added U.S. investors who are unable to take currency risk by investing in lira-paying bonds, could consider buying Italian Yankee bonds.

Plaut said he expects spreads on Italian 30-year Yankees to tighten 10-15 basis points versus similar maturity U.S. Treasuries over the same period as the Italian credit situation improves.
