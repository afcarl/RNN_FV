INSIGHT - Dollar still seen taking high road.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

The dollar retreated from recent highs this week against the mark and yen, but an energetic U.S. currency will likely climb higher provided crucial support levels remain intact, chartists said.

"While the dollar stays above 1.5250 (marks) support, we view this down-move in the dollar as a corrective move," said Thomas Worden, vice president of the global technical analysis group at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.

Therefore, the trend in the dollar is still higher, he added.  

Worden dubbed 1.5250 marks as a 61.8 percent retracement of the dollar rally from 1.4950 to 1.5730. Should the dollar break below 1.5250 marks on an intraday basis or on a closing basis the dollar could be in trouble, Worden said. The currency could then retest 1.50 marks.

In afternoon dealings, the dollar traded at 1.5465/75 marks at 1500 EST/2000 GMT, higher than 1.5305/10 at the open but still well below the week's earlier peak near 1.5730.

Stephanie Davis, foreign exchange technical analyst at Technical Data, said the dollar would likely encounter major support at the psychological level of 1.50 marks.  

"So, I don't think you'd have to be worried even if it pulled all the way back to 1.50 (marks)," Davis said. "And I don't think that's going to happen next week."

It is not uncommon to retest previous levels of support or resistance before resuming the prior trend, Davis added.

The dollar also surged versus the Japanese currency this week, hitting 114.75 yen on Monday, a level just shy of the 1996 high of 114.92 yen reached on October 29.

At 1500 EST/2000 GMT, the dollar traded at 112.95/00 yen, up from 112.15/25 yen at the open.  

Davis identified 112 yen as the most critical level for the dollar. "Even though it's been sold off, it hasn't closed below 112 since the twenty second of November," said Davis, adding the dollar does not appear to be headed for a close below 112 on Friday.

For his part, DMG's Worden said the dollar can go higher provided it stays above 111.70/90 yen.

But he warned, "If we loose 111.70/90 then something else is going on and we're going to test 110.50 and possibly lower."
