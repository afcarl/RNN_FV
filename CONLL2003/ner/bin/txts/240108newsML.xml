<title>USA: INSIGHT - Dollar still seen taking high road.</title>
<headline>INSIGHT - Dollar still seen taking high road.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>The dollar retreated from recent highs this week against the mark and yen, but an energetic U.S. currency will likely climb higher provided crucial support levels remain intact, chartists said.</p>
<p>&quot;While the dollar stays above 1.5250 (marks) support, we view this down-move in the dollar as a corrective move,&quot; said Thomas Worden, vice president of the global technical analysis group at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Therefore, the trend in the dollar is still higher, he added.  </p>
<p>Worden dubbed 1.5250 marks as a 61.8 percent retracement of the dollar rally from 1.4950 to 1.5730. Should the dollar break below 1.5250 marks on an intraday basis or on a closing basis the dollar could be in trouble, Worden said. The currency could then retest 1.50 marks.</p>
<p>In afternoon dealings, the dollar traded at 1.5465/75 marks at 1500 EST/2000 GMT, higher than 1.5305/10 at the open but still well below the week's earlier peak near 1.5730.</p>
<p>Stephanie Davis, foreign exchange technical analyst at Technical Data, said the dollar would likely encounter major support at the psychological level of 1.50 marks.  </p>
<p>&quot;So, I don't think you'd have to be worried even if it pulled all the way back to 1.50 (marks),&quot; Davis said. &quot;And I don't think that's going to happen next week.&quot;</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to retest previous levels of support or resistance before resuming the prior trend, Davis added.</p>
<p>The dollar also surged versus the Japanese currency this week, hitting 114.75 yen on Monday, a level just shy of the 1996 high of 114.92 yen reached on October 29.</p>
<p>At 1500 EST/2000 GMT, the dollar traded at 112.95/00 yen, up from 112.15/25 yen at the open.  </p>
<p>Davis identified 112 yen as the most critical level for the dollar. &quot;Even though it's been sold off, it hasn't closed below 112 since the twenty second of November,&quot; said Davis, adding the dollar does not appear to be headed for a close below 112 on Friday.</p>
<p>For his part, DMG's Worden said the dollar can go higher provided it stays above 111.70/90 yen.</p>
<p>But he warned, &quot;If we loose 111.70/90 then something else is going on and we're going to test 110.50 and possibly lower.&quot;</p>
