FCOJ futures end firmer, upside potential seen.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

NYCE frozen concentrated orange juice most active January futures contract settled firmer, but all months further forward ended weaker as the market's technical picture continued to look vulnerable, traders said.

Analyst Jim Cordier of Allendale Commodities said there was strong resistance at 97.00 to 98.00 cents per pound basis January, but he expected a rally over $1.00 per pound in the third week of December as the market entered the winter season.

"The speculators will be buying prior to the Christmas week and New Year. People will be long over that period," Cordier said.

January juice ended 0.20 cent firmer at 95.05 cents per pound, traded 95.10 to 93.70 cents.

Merrill Lynch said in its weekly citrus letter on Friday that specs were adding more to their short than to their long positions, but the first hint of cold weather in Florida could send speculators flocking back to the market.

Merrill said low prices should spur consumption, but the big hike in open interest was becoming a burden.

"The positions are on and it increases the potential upside volatility much more than the downside," Merrill said.
