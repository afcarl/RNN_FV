Ameritech energy venture adding homes to trial.

Ameritech Corp will plug more Midwest households into its utility home automation program, a market that it says could grow to several billion dollars over the next five years.

The move is part of Ameritech's strategy to expand beyond its core telephone business, according to Richard Taylor, president and chief executive of Energy Connections, Ameritech's joint venture with Wisconsin Energy Corp.

"What we're trying to do is diversify beyond telecommunications," Taylor said in a recent interview. He declined to disclose Ameritech's investment in the market.

"A multi-billion dollar industry...that would be over the next five years," Taylor said of the market potential. But he said it is too early to project potential revenues for Ameritech from Energy Connections.

Home automation uses communications and computer equipment to link a home's energy guzzlers -- such as hot water heaters and furnaces -- and allow consumers to monitor and regulate their energy use while they are away.

This energy information service allows power use to be centrally regulated, cutting consumption during pricey peak hours and making up for it off-peak.

Energy Connection has already signed up 2,000 homes in the Chicago area, in a deal with Unicom Corp's Commonwealth Edison, an electric utility.

In Milwaukee, Wisconsin Electric Power, a unit of Wisconsin Energy, has 200 homes in a trial. Taylor said that number is expected to grow to 5,000 to 10,000 next year.

The average household can save as much as 25 percent on monthly utility bills with the service, Taylor said.

Although today's products are for residential use, he said businesses and manufacturing operations are expected to embrace the technology as well.

The roll-out of Energy Connections reflects the deregulation in the utility sector, prompting electric companies to look for ways to make their everyday service more attractive. Ameritech's clients will be the utility companies, who will in turn offer the services to their customers.

"Within the next year, instead of being something that people are talking about and trying to get to know, it will be something that's more of a household word," Taylor said.

Going forward, Energy Connections is looking at a nation-wide communications network as the backbone of its energy information service.

Next year, the joint venture will test  Wincom Corp 's national Interactive Video Data Services communications network, which also includes security encryption technology.

"It (energy use) is one of the last types of things to become automated, and we would have expected it to be automated a long time ago," Sean O'Keefe, president of Wincom, said.
