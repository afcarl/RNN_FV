FORECAST-U.S. retail sales in spotlight Dec 9 week.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

U.S. retail sales figures will be scrutinized next Thursday, Dec 12 for any clear signals of consumer sentiment, experts said in a Reuters poll.

On average, 23 economists surveyed on Friday forecast retail sales grew by 0.3 percent in November, compared with a 0.2 percent increase last month.

They predicted a 0.4 percent rise in November exlcuding auto sales versus a 0.4 percent increase the previous month.

"The key to the economy is what happens to consumers," said John Williams, managing director and chief global markets economist for BT Securities Corp.  

Forecasting total retail sales grew 0.1 percent in November, Williams said his prediction falls on the heels of a couple of fairly strong months.

"So just holding up that level is reasonably impressive," Williams said.

Slated for release on December 11 at 0830 EST/1330 GMT is the Producer Price Index (PPI).

On average, experts forecast PPI increased 0.3 percent in November, compared to a 0.4 percent rise last month. Excluding food and energy prices, they forecast PPI grew 0.2 percent, compared to a 0.3 percent drop in October.  

"The last couple of months have been extraordinarily volatile," said Peter D'Antonio, an economist at Citicorp Global Finance N.A. "We had big swings in energy."

D'Antonio said his PPI forecast is relatively neutral because he expects its usually volatile food and energy components have settled down.

"I'm looking for more run-of-the-mill type numbers."

Another inflation report, on consumer prices, is scheduled for release on Thursday.
