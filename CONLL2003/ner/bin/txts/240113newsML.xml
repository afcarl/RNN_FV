<headline>FORECAST-U.S. retail sales in spotlight Dec 9 week.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>U.S. retail sales figures will be scrutinized next Thursday, Dec 12 for any clear signals of consumer sentiment, experts said in a Reuters poll.</p>
<p>On average, 23 economists surveyed on Friday forecast retail sales grew by 0.3 percent in November, compared with a 0.2 percent increase last month.</p>
<p>They predicted a 0.4 percent rise in November exlcuding auto sales versus a 0.4 percent increase the previous month.</p>
<p>&quot;The key to the economy is what happens to consumers,&quot; said John Williams, managing director and chief global markets economist for BT Securities Corp.  </p>
<p>Forecasting total retail sales grew 0.1 percent in November, Williams said his prediction falls on the heels of a couple of fairly strong months.</p>
<p>&quot;So just holding up that level is reasonably impressive,&quot; Williams said.</p>
<p>Slated for release on December 11 at 0830 EST/1330 GMT is the Producer Price Index (PPI).</p>
<p>On average, experts forecast PPI increased 0.3 percent in November, compared to a 0.4 percent rise last month. Excluding food and energy prices, they forecast PPI grew 0.2 percent, compared to a 0.3 percent drop in October.  </p>
<p>&quot;The last couple of months have been extraordinarily volatile,&quot; said Peter D'Antonio, an economist at Citicorp Global Finance N.A. &quot;We had big swings in energy.&quot;</p>
<p>D'Antonio said his PPI forecast is relatively neutral because he expects its usually volatile food and energy components have settled down.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm looking for more run-of-the-mill type numbers.&quot;</p>
<p>Another inflation report, on consumer prices, is scheduled for release on Thursday.</p>
