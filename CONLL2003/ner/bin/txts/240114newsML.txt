WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

The U.S. Transportation Department said on Friday it was disappointed with the lack of progress in the just-concluded talks with Britain to reach a free-market aviation agreement.

It added that no date was set for resumed negotiations.

The three-day talks in London, which ended Friday, were aimed at replacing their restrictive bilateral aviation services accord with a new "open skies" agreement.

"The U.S. side was disappointed with the lack of progress that was achieved in this round of talks and in light of this result we will consider what steps should be taken next," the department said in a statement.
