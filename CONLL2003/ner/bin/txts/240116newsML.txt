Colombia's crusading chief prosecutor said on Friday it was imperative his country's congress approved tougher extradition laws to fight drug traffickers and to salvage relations with the United States.

Alfonso Valdivieso also defended himself against charges he had taken money from drug barons. He was willing to answer to an investigation, he told a news conference in Miami.

Valdivieso has campaigned to expose corrupt politicians linked to Colombia's drug barons.

His crusade has made him a favourite of Washington, which is otherwise highly critical of what it sees as a lacklustre anti-drugs effort by Colombian authorities, but his foes have accused him of being a U.S. puppet.

Valdiviseo said an extradition bill now before the congress was not tough enough. "We must not think we are doing it for the United States but because Colombia itself needs it," he said. "We need more self-esteem."

Colombia's assembly abolished extradition of suspected traffickers in 1991 in the face of a violent offensive by drug cartels in which dozens of judges, police and other citizens were killed. The attacks subsequently halted.

Washington, which decertified Colombia in March as an ally in the drugs war, triggering less funding, is pressing Bogota to send traffickers to stand trial in the United States.

The U.S. ambassador in Bogota, Myles Frechette, in October criticised the bill before congress as too weak because it would not apply retroactively nor to traffickers who surrendered voluntarily.

This means leaders of the Cali cartel now serving light sentences cannot be extradited when they are released.

In July, Washington refused a visa for President Ernesto Samper, who is dogged by allegations of links to drug barons.

"We need to improve the relationship with the United States by taking action. We cannot allow a second decertification to happen," Valdavieso said.

The chief prosecutor reiterated he was not involved with drug traffickers and said he was co-operating with a Congressional investigation.

In October, Attorney general Orlando Vasquez Velasqez, who has since been jailed for his ties to drug lords, said Valdivieso accepted a campaign contribution from a car dealership owned by reputed drug trafficker, Efrain Hernandez.

Valdivieso has acknowledged receiving money but said he did not know of the dealership's link to Hernandez.

"I want to make clear I have had no dealings with drug dealers," he said. "I've been through five (investigation) sittings and that's very good because the prosecutor should not be immune. It should be very clear what I represent and the way I act."
