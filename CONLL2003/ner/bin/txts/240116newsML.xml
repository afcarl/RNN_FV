<p>Colombia's crusading chief prosecutor said on Friday it was imperative his country's congress approved tougher extradition laws to fight drug traffickers and to salvage relations with the United States.</p>
<p>Alfonso Valdivieso also defended himself against charges he had taken money from drug barons. He was willing to answer to an investigation, he told a news conference in Miami.</p>
<p>Valdivieso has campaigned to expose corrupt politicians linked to Colombia's drug barons.</p>
<p>His crusade has made him a favourite of Washington, which is otherwise highly critical of what it sees as a lacklustre anti-drugs effort by Colombian authorities, but his foes have accused him of being a U.S. puppet.</p>
<p>Valdiviseo said an extradition bill now before the congress was not tough enough. &quot;We must not think we are doing it for the United States but because Colombia itself needs it,&quot; he said. &quot;We need more self-esteem.&quot;</p>
<p>Colombia's assembly abolished extradition of suspected traffickers in 1991 in the face of a violent offensive by drug cartels in which dozens of judges, police and other citizens were killed. The attacks subsequently halted.</p>
<p>Washington, which decertified Colombia in March as an ally in the drugs war, triggering less funding, is pressing Bogota to send traffickers to stand trial in the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. ambassador in Bogota, Myles Frechette, in October criticised the bill before congress as too weak because it would not apply retroactively nor to traffickers who surrendered voluntarily.</p>
<p>This means leaders of the Cali cartel now serving light sentences cannot be extradited when they are released.</p>
<p>In July, Washington refused a visa for President Ernesto Samper, who is dogged by allegations of links to drug barons.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to improve the relationship with the United States by taking action. We cannot allow a second decertification to happen,&quot; Valdavieso said.</p>
<p>The chief prosecutor reiterated he was not involved with drug traffickers and said he was co-operating with a Congressional investigation.</p>
<p>In October, Attorney general Orlando Vasquez Velasqez, who has since been jailed for his ties to drug lords, said Valdivieso accepted a campaign contribution from a car dealership owned by reputed drug trafficker, Efrain Hernandez.</p>
<p>Valdivieso has acknowledged receiving money but said he did not know of the dealership's link to Hernandez.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to make clear I have had no dealings with drug dealers,&quot; he said. &quot;I've been through five (investigation) sittings and that's very good because the prosecutor should not be immune. It should be very clear what I represent and the way I act.&quot;</p>
