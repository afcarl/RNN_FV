Duke SC nuke to stay off line thru weekend.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Duke Power Co said Friday the 1,129 megawatt (MW) Catawba 1 nuclear power unit in Clover, S.C., will remain off line through at least this weekend.

The unit was taken off line late Thursday due to a leak in a small reactor coolant pump, company spokesman Rick Zuercher said, adding the company could not yet comment on when the unit would resume generating electricity.

Duke Power is the operator of the plant with a 25 percent share.

Duke's two McGuire nuclear units in North Carolina, with generating capacities of 1,129 MW, are both operating at full power.

However, Duke's three Oconee nuclear units, each generating 846 megawatts, are shut and are not expected to restart until January, the company has reported.
