CME live and feeder cattle close lower.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

CME live and feeder cattle futures closed lower, pressured early by a sharp drop in stock markets and later by lower midday cash beef prices, traders said.

Also bearish were forecasts for lower cash cattle prices next week.

Feeders largely followed the drop in live cattle and stocks, plus from light spreading that involved buying live cattle and selling feeders.

Stocks fell early after Fed Chairman Greenspan said recent stock gains were irrational and could damage the economy.

But stocks later recovered much of the decline, removing pressure from the commodity markets.

Beef prices continue to fall, frustrating cattle traders who have expected a turnaround from the week-long decline. At midday Friday, USDA beef cutout values were unchanged to down $0.28 per cwt for choice cuts. The cutout value for 700 to 850-lb choice cuts dropped to $108.02 from $118.05 a week ago.
