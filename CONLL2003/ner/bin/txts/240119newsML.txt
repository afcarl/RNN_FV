Kansas lawmaker details new school funding plan.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

A Kansas lawmaker said Friday he is preparing legislation to eliminate the state's school property tax, replacing it with a hike in the state sales tax and a decrease in the state's budget balance.

State Rep. Henry Helgerson, D-Wichita, said his plan would result in a net tax reduction of about $300 million between the elimination of $625 million in state property taxes and a one cent hike in the current 4.9 cent sales tax, which is estimated to raise $325 million.

The plan also calls for reducing the state's ending balance from its current level of 12 percent of general fund expenditures to a minimum of four percent, he said.

In addition, Helgerson said his plan would increase state aid to public schools by $30 million a year tied to performance standards.

"The states that have been successful in the past have decreased taxes, invested in strong educational system, lowered property taxes and controlled government spending," he said. "That is the direction Kansas needs to head."

The elimination of the state property tax would result in a 25 percent to 40 percent reduction in business and residential property taxes, he added. Property taxes would still be levied by schools and local governments.

He said he plans to introduce legislation when the Republican-controlled legislature convenes next month.
