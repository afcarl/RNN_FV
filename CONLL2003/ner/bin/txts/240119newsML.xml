<p>A Kansas lawmaker said Friday he is preparing legislation to eliminate the state's school property tax, replacing it with a hike in the state sales tax and a decrease in the state's budget balance.</p>
<p>State Rep. Henry Helgerson, D-Wichita, said his plan would result in a net tax reduction of about $300 million between the elimination of $625 million in state property taxes and a one cent hike in the current 4.9 cent sales tax, which is estimated to raise $325 million.</p>
<p>The plan also calls for reducing the state's ending balance from its current level of 12 percent of general fund expenditures to a minimum of four percent, he said.</p>
<p>In addition, Helgerson said his plan would increase state aid to public schools by $30 million a year tied to performance standards.</p>
<p>&quot;The states that have been successful in the past have decreased taxes, invested in strong educational system, lowered property taxes and controlled government spending,&quot; he said. &quot;That is the direction Kansas needs to head.&quot;</p>
<p>The elimination of the state property tax would result in a 25 percent to 40 percent reduction in business and residential property taxes, he added. Property taxes would still be levied by schools and local governments.</p>
<p>He said he plans to introduce legislation when the Republican-controlled legislature convenes next month.</p>
