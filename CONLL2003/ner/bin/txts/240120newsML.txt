CSCE coffee ends down as weak tone persists.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

CSCE coffee futures edged lower Friday for the sixth straight session as commission house selling pressured the market, dealers said.

Scale-down trade buying limited losses, however.

Brisk switch activity, particularly in the March/May switch, accounted for much of the day's turnover, which was at an estimated 12,200 lots. March/May ended little changed, dipping to 2.10 cents a lb Friday from 2.15 cents Thursday.

March coffee closed off 0.20 cent at 103.25 cents a lb, its lowest settlement since Oct 18, after trading from 105.20 to 102.25. Spot December futures finished down 0.70 cent at 111.75, while the outer months ended 0.15 to 1.15 weaker.

Technically, traders said March coffee has strong support at the 100.00-cent mark. Resistance was pegged at 105.50 cents, then 107.50 cents.

With active March ending in negative territory every day this week, prices slid 4.50 cents or about four percent since last Friday.

Traders said the market appeared technically oversold and is due for a correction.

"It is overdone on the downside," one trader said. "I expect prices to trade up a bit on Monday."
