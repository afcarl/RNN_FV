<title>USA: CSCE coffee ends down as weak tone persists.</title>
<headline>CSCE coffee ends down as weak tone persists.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE coffee futures edged lower Friday for the sixth straight session as commission house selling pressured the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Scale-down trade buying limited losses, however.</p>
<p>Brisk switch activity, particularly in the March/May switch, accounted for much of the day's turnover, which was at an estimated 12,200 lots. March/May ended little changed, dipping to 2.10 cents a lb Friday from 2.15 cents Thursday.</p>
<p>March coffee closed off 0.20 cent at 103.25 cents a lb, its lowest settlement since Oct 18, after trading from 105.20 to 102.25. Spot December futures finished down 0.70 cent at 111.75, while the outer months ended 0.15 to 1.15 weaker.</p>
<p>Technically, traders said March coffee has strong support at the 100.00-cent mark. Resistance was pegged at 105.50 cents, then 107.50 cents.</p>
<p>With active March ending in negative territory every day this week, prices slid 4.50 cents or about four percent since last Friday.</p>
<p>Traders said the market appeared technically oversold and is due for a correction.</p>
<p>&quot;It is overdone on the downside,&quot; one trader said. &quot;I expect prices to trade up a bit on Monday.&quot;</p>
