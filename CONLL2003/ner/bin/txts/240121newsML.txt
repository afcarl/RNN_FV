Continental pilots to hire adviser to mull merger.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Continental Airlines Inc's pilots union said Friday it planned to hire its own financial advisers to evaluate a possible merger with Delta Air Lines Inc.

The union did not comment on whether it supported a potential merger, but said it planned to conduct its own financial analysis.

The union did not comment on what financial advisory firm it would retain. The pilots also said they were in contact with merger counsel.  

Independent Association of Continental Pilots, in a phone message to members, said it initiated talks with Delta's union and with Air Line Pilots Association to discuss a potential deal.

The union said its efforts to meet with Continental have been rebuffed.

The company told the pilots they were prohibited by law from commenting on the issue, beyond the letter issued to employees on Wednesday, the union said.  

In that memo to employees, Continental did not confirm or deny the merger talks but said no merger deal was imminent.

"We certainly understand that management is limited on what they can and cannot say without stepping outside SEC limitations. However, a blanket refusal to meet with union leadership to allow us to express our concerns...is disappointing, to say the least," the union said.

Continental did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the union's plan to conduct an independent evaluation of the deal.
