<title>USA: Continental pilots to hire adviser to mull merger.</title>
<headline>Continental pilots to hire adviser to mull merger.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Continental Airlines Inc's pilots union said Friday it planned to hire its own financial advisers to evaluate a possible merger with Delta Air Lines Inc.</p>
<p>The union did not comment on whether it supported a potential merger, but said it planned to conduct its own financial analysis.</p>
<p>The union did not comment on what financial advisory firm it would retain. The pilots also said they were in contact with merger counsel.  </p>
<p>Independent Association of Continental Pilots, in a phone message to members, said it initiated talks with Delta's union and with Air Line Pilots Association to discuss a potential deal.</p>
<p>The union said its efforts to meet with Continental have been rebuffed.</p>
<p>The company told the pilots they were prohibited by law from commenting on the issue, beyond the letter issued to employees on Wednesday, the union said.  </p>
<p>In that memo to employees, Continental did not confirm or deny the merger talks but said no merger deal was imminent.</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly understand that management is limited on what they can and cannot say without stepping outside SEC limitations. However, a blanket refusal to meet with union leadership to allow us to express our concerns...is disappointing, to say the least,&quot; the union said.</p>
<p>Continental did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the union's plan to conduct an independent evaluation of the deal.</p>
