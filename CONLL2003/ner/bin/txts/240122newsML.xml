<p>President Clinton aims to hold more news conferences in his second term and will have one Dec. 13, the White House said Friday.</p>
<p>The president had only two formal, full-blown news conferences last year, one in January and one after he won re-election in November, although he had various other limited sessions with the press.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton &quot;plans to have regular news conferences&quot; during his second term. But when asked how frequent these would be, he was evasive, saying, &quot;periodic, occasional.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He enjoys the give and take&quot; with reporters, the spokesman added.</p>
