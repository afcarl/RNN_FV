<p>First Chicago NBD Corp, while still open to acquisitions to expand its banking network, expects more retail branches to be cut over time as customers bank electronically or at supermarkets.</p>
<p>&quot;As customers use more and more of those (channels), we've got to take away more of the brick and mortar&quot; branches, Verne Istock, chief executive, said in an interview Thursday.</p>
<p>But don't expect First Chicago to make drastic cuts like the nearly 280 branches that Ohio-based KeyCorp said last month it would close or sell.  </p>
<p>&quot;I don't think that's the approach we want,&quot; Istock said. &quot;I think that's pretty dramatic. I think you're better off to do it on an orderly basis from a customer satisfaction standpoint as well as an employee basis.&quot;</p>
<p>First Chicago has closed about 25 branches since the merger with Detroit-based NBD Bancorp a year ago that created what is now the ninth largest bank holding company in the United States, with $106.7 billion in assets.</p>
<p>But at the same time, First Chicago could be looking to expand its retail customer base through acquisitions of other banks in the greater Midwest.  </p>
<p>&quot;I have publicly said on more occasions than once that this organization does have an interest in expanding through acquisitions where it makes sense for shareholders,&quot; Istock said.</p>
<p>This means any acquisition First Chicago does could only dilute earnings for a short time, if at all, he added.</p>
<p>But Istock also said First Chicago has not had talks with Milwaukee based Firstar Corp, which has been mentioned as a possible First Chicago target for at least a year.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had no discussions,&quot; he said of Firstar. He would not comment on other possible acquisition targets.  </p>
<p>Istock also reiterated that an acquisition could be made outside of traditional banking as regulatory lines between banking other financial businesses are erased.</p>
<p>Insurance, investment banking and securities banking are all areas that could be targets of traditional banks, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're willing to consider any alternative that we think makes sense for our shareholders first of all and also for enhancing our customer relationships,&quot; Istock said.</p>
<p>Analysts see First Chicago as having excess capital on its books, which weighs on a bank's performance. EVEREN Securities analyst Thomas Maier said the bank could have more than $2 billion in excess capital, while others estimate a lower amount.</p>
<p>An aggressive 40-million-share stock repurchase plan has helped allay analysts' and investors' concerns about the excess capital. But making a purchase could also put capital to work.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a way of in fact buying your stock back without having to go out in the market to do it,&quot; Maier said.</p>
<p>First Chicago shares were up 5/8 at 55-1/2 Friday.</p>
