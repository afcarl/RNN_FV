Unemployment rises in November, helps calm markets.

The unemployment rate edged higher and job growth slowed in November, the government said on Friday, soothing financial markets after critical remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sent Wall Street on a wild ride.

The Labour Department, in the government's first assessment of the economy's performance in November, said unemployment rose to 5.4 percent last month as 118,000 new jobs were created.

The jobless rate was 5.2 percent in October, when 224,000 jobs were created. The department had previously estimated October job creation at 210,000.

For Wall Street, the new data on jobs served as a mild tonic after a steep stock market slide of more than 100 points that was sparked by Greenspan's remarks Thursday night suggesting that overheated markets can pose economic dangers.

Stock and bond markets, which had been worried that a drop in unemployment would signal the economy was shaking off a needed slowing that would keep inflation in check, gathered strength from the new data.

"Today's unemployment data had the effect of erasing concerns that had surfaced in the last few days that the (unemployment) rate had fallen and job creation had been very strong," said David Resler of Nomura Securities.

"After Mr. Greenspan's reality check ... had caused markets around the world to tank, unnecessarily because nothing in the speech indicated any change in Fed thinking, the soft jobs report helped bouy prices," added First Union economist Joel Naroff.

The report was weaker than estimated by Wall Street analysts, who had projected the November unemployment rate would remain unchanged and that 179,000 jobs would be produced.

The department said workers' average hourly earnings, closely watched for signs of wage inflation, rose 9 cents an hour after being down a revised one cent an hour in October.

The wage increase, however, was largely dismissed by Bureau of Labour Statistics Commmissioner Katharine Abraham, who said the number was often volatile.

"As I mentioned in June, when we had a similarly large jump, the monthly movements in earnings are quite erratic," she told reporters.

The report seemed to give additional weight to the view that the economy has been chugging along at a slowing pace, with few signs that inflation was becoming a problem.

"It's another example of how the economy has slowed down dramatically," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Chase Manhattan's Chase Regional Bank. "One hundred eighteen thousand jobs is the weakest in recent memory and the fact is that most of the jobs that were created were service jobs and retail jobs, most of which were lower paying."

Oscar Gonzalez of John Hancock Financial Services added, "The economy continues to sputter along, but at least it hasn't thrown a rod."

The Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book summary of national economic activity, released on Wednesday, suggested the economy was on course for slow but steady expansion, with little need for interest-rate rises to dampen inflation risks.

The central bank's policy-makers meet Dec. 17 to decide the future course of interest rates.

While the economy has clearly been slowing, it is still showing enough vitality to keep the momentum under way.

For example, the Commerce Department reported Friday that factory orders rose more sharply than had been expected in October, overcoming the impact of a slowdown in the automotive industry.

Total new orders rose 0.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted $321.3 billion following a revised 2.6 percent jump in September orders. Wall Street economists had forecast only a 0.2 percent gain in October orders.

The Labour Department said job creation during last month reflected gains across the board, though some of them were modest, with the exception of government work, which showed a decline.

The workweek rose by 0.2 hour last month to 34.5, while overtime increased by 0.1 hour to 4.5 hours.

Goods-producing industries created 22,000 jobs, while the government cut jobs by an identical amount.

The largest job gains were in the services area, with a 96,000 rise, while construction added 14,000 jobs and manufacturing added 9,000.
