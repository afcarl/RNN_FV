U.S. West spot power lower as weather moderates.

LOS ANGELES 1996-12-06

Spot power prices in the U.S. West fell amid moderating weather, rainfall in the Northwest and lower natural gas prices, market sources said Friday.

"Temperatures are moderating and there is lots of water," said one Portland, Ore., trader.

While most of the recent rain in the Northwest has been to the east of the Cascade Mountains, snow at lower elevations is expected to melt, adding to near-term flows through hydroelectric dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers, he explained.

For Monday, however, Bonneville Power Administration continued to offer surplus power only during off-peak demand hours.

Firm, peak California-Oregon border (COB) electricity for Monday was assessed at $28.00-29.00 per megawatt hour (MWh), down from $32.00-35.00 for Friday.

Firm, off-peak COB power for Monday was also lower at $17.00-18.00.

Monday firm, peak power at Mid-Columbia (Mid-C) was quoted at $27.50-28.50, down from $29.00-30.00.

Monday firm, off-peak power at Mid-C was also lower at $17.00-18.00.

Southwest prices were down in line with the Northwest.

"It is a bit warmer in Arizona and more people are trying to sell," said another power trader.

Firm, peak Palo Verde (PV) electricity for Monday was quoted at $27.00-28.00 per MWh, down from $29.00-30.00. Firm, off-peak PV power was unchanged at $17.00-18.00.

Monday firm, peak prices at Four Corners were quoted lower at $28.00-29.00 per MWh, while firm off-peak was assessed at $17.00-18.00.
