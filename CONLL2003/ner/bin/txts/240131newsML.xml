<p>Spot power prices in the U.S. West fell amid moderating weather, rainfall in the Northwest and lower natural gas prices, market sources said Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Temperatures are moderating and there is lots of water,&quot; said one Portland, Ore., trader.</p>
<p>While most of the recent rain in the Northwest has been to the east of the Cascade Mountains, snow at lower elevations is expected to melt, adding to near-term flows through hydroelectric dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers, he explained.</p>
<p>For Monday, however, Bonneville Power Administration continued to offer surplus power only during off-peak demand hours.</p>
<p>Firm, peak California-Oregon border (COB) electricity for Monday was assessed at $28.00-29.00 per megawatt hour (MWh), down from $32.00-35.00 for Friday.</p>
<p>Firm, off-peak COB power for Monday was also lower at $17.00-18.00.</p>
<p>Monday firm, peak power at Mid-Columbia (Mid-C) was quoted at $27.50-28.50, down from $29.00-30.00.</p>
<p>Monday firm, off-peak power at Mid-C was also lower at $17.00-18.00.</p>
<p>Southwest prices were down in line with the Northwest.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a bit warmer in Arizona and more people are trying to sell,&quot; said another power trader.</p>
<p>Firm, peak Palo Verde (PV) electricity for Monday was quoted at $27.00-28.00 per MWh, down from $29.00-30.00. Firm, off-peak PV power was unchanged at $17.00-18.00.</p>
<p>Monday firm, peak prices at Four Corners were quoted lower at $28.00-29.00 per MWh, while firm off-peak was assessed at $17.00-18.00.</p>
