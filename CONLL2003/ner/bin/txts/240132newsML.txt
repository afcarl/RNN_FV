Moody's, S&P cut San Diego, point to tax measure.

SAN DIEGO, Calif. 1996-12-06

Two major credit rating agencies slashed the debt ratings of city of San Diego in southern California, citing the passage of a controversial tax measure in November.

In response, city officials warned that the downgrades could end up costing taxpayers by increasing San Diego's borrowing costs.

Moody's Investors Service Inc said Friday it cut to Aa1 from Aaa the city's general obligation bonds.  

Standard & Poor's Corp said Thursday it lowered San Diego's general obligation bonds to AA from AA-plus.

Both rating agencies cited the passage of California's Proposition 218, which amended the state Constitution to require voter approval of most tax or fee increases and curtailed the use of many types of assessments.

"Proposition 218 was the straw that broke the camel's back," said Ken Kurtz, a Moody's vice president. He added that a series of developments in the state have accelerated a reduction in local government financial flexibility. The most notable of these developments was Proposition 218, he said.  

S&P Director Jeffrey Thiemann said the passage of Proposition 218 was the key factor in S&P's decision.

"Specifically, the city lost its ability to levy taxes, such as a utility user's tax or gross receipts tax, without an election -- a source of considerable untapped flexibility that existed prior to the initiative's passage," S&P said. "Although the city's financial management remains strong, year-end general fund balances are thin."

San Diego City Manager Jack McGrory said the downgrades were a dissappointment that could result in higher borrowing costs for the city.  

McGrory said each incremental downgrade in credit rating could translate into an extra $600,000 in financing costs per $10 million of a 30-year general obligation bond.

"To be downgraded because of the specter of Proposition 218, when people don't know the specific impacts yet, is very disappointing for us," the city manager said. "If the bonds go out at higher levels, then we'll have to cut expenditures somewhere in the budget."

Market participants said the downgrades were not unexpected. "It doesn't really come as a big surprise," said Tom Lockard, a partner at underwriter Stone & Youngberg LLC.  

"There's no rush to unload. There's no panic," Lockard said. "As we've said, in the long run, this (proposition) is not a healthy thing for California credits. Clearly, that's manifested in the San Diego downgrades."

Thiemann said S&P was evaluating other cities in the state in the wake of Proposition 218, but noted that San Diego's case was unique.

Moody's said its ratings on the general obligation and lease debt of the other large cities in California were also under review as a result of the proposition. The reviews are expected to be completed in the next several weeks.

Since its passage last month, Proposition 218 has drawn considerable fire from local government officials throughout California and municipal analysts across the country.

The Los Angeles City Council recently voted to sue over the measure.
