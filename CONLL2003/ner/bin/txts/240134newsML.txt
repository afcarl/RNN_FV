U.S. SEC clears muni board price transparency rule.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

The U.S. SEC said Friday it approved a rule requiring muni bond firms to report prices and other data from trades with retail and institutional buyers to industry regulators beginning Jan. 1, 1998.

The amendments to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's rule G-14 are the start of a major new phase in the Securities and Exchange Commission's campaign to improve price transparency in the muni market.  

The revisions, tentatively approved by the 15-member MSRB in August, will not take full effect until Jan. 1, 1998.

But MSRB wants the rule enacted now so that firms are ready for mandatory testing of the program in summer 1997, Christopher Taylor, MSRB executive director, said in a recent telephone interview.

Under the first phase of the board's price transparency program, dealers simply had to report data from interdealer trades, which they already report to the National Securities Clearing Corporation.  

The new rule requires dealers to get executing broker symbols from the National Association of Securities Dealers within 30 days, or in early January 1997.

By July 1, 1997, dealers must provide the board with the name and telephone number of someone responsible for testing the firm's ability to report customer transaction information.

Dealers must test their reporting programs between July and December, 1997, on a schedule that the board will announce. They must begin reporting customer transactions on January 1, 1998.

Regulators like the SEC want the new data to help them monitor whether dealers are fairly pricing the tax-exempt bonds they sell to investors.
