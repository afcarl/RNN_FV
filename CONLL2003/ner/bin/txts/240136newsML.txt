Naked Florida man sought for attacking schoolgirls.

ORLANDO, Fla. 1996-12-06

Florida police were searching Friday for a naked man who attacked three girls as they made their way to school bus stops, raping one and robbing another in separate incidents.

All three attacks occurred Thursday and Orlando police said they suspected the man may have been responsible for a string of recent indecent exposure cases involving teenage girls on their way to school bus stops.

Investigators, who said the man appeared to be in his late 20s, warned students not to walk alone and to have a parent with them until the school bus arrived.

In the first attack, before dawn, a naked man with a goatee beard got out of a car, demanded a 15-year-old girl give him her purse and then drove away.

Police said the man appeared again a few miles away, where another 15-year-old saw him get out of the car with a gun. He drove away when she screamed.

He later forced a 14-year-old into his car, drove her to nearby woods and raped her.
