<headline>Naked Florida man sought for attacking schoolgirls.</headline>

<text>
<p>Florida police were searching Friday for a naked man who attacked three girls as they made their way to school bus stops, raping one and robbing another in separate incidents.</p>
<p>All three attacks occurred Thursday and Orlando police said they suspected the man may have been responsible for a string of recent indecent exposure cases involving teenage girls on their way to school bus stops.</p>
<p>Investigators, who said the man appeared to be in his late 20s, warned students not to walk alone and to have a parent with them until the school bus arrived.</p>
<p>In the first attack, before dawn, a naked man with a goatee beard got out of a car, demanded a 15-year-old girl give him her purse and then drove away.</p>
<p>Police said the man appeared again a few miles away, where another 15-year-old saw him get out of the car with a gun. He drove away when she screamed.</p>
<p>He later forced a 14-year-old into his car, drove her to nearby woods and raped her.</p>
