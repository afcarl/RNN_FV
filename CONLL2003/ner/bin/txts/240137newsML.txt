No mercy for meter-feeding grandmother.

CINCINNATI 1996-12-06

A judge on Friday declined to dismiss charges against a grandmother who was hauled off to jail for feeding strangers' parking meters -- her birthday and St. Nicholas Day notwithstanding.

Judge John West of Cincinnati Municipal Court heard final arguments on the case and said he would issue a ruling on Dec. 20. The grandmother, Sylvia Stayton, has become a minor celebrity since her arrest on Oct. 24 on charges of obstructing official business and disorderly conduct.

She was jailed briefly after tossing 15 cents into two expired parking meters as a police officer, who told her to stop, was writing a ticket for one of the vehicles. She said she did it on impulse and thought the policeman was exceeding his authority in trying to curb her generosity.

Before Friday's court appearance Stayton said she hoped the judge would toss the case out and end the whole affair. Friday marked her 63rd birthday, as well as the day many Christians honour St. Nicholas, the 4th century bishop revered for anonymous gift-giving.
