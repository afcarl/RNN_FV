U.S. spot natgas retreats ahead of mild weekend.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

U.S. spot natgas prices softened by about 20 cents Friday after gaining more than 40 cents in the two previous trading days, pressured by mild temperatures across most of the U.S., excluding the East.

Prices on the Gulf Coast pipes fell about 20 cents into the low-to-mid $3.60s as Northeast buyers most likely relied on sufficient storage supplies to meet heating demand.

American Gas Association said gas stocks in the Consuming Region East were about 86 percent of capacity, after losing about 62 bcf last week.  

At the New York city-gate, where below-normal temperatures are expected to hover slightly below-normal through next week, prices fell into the $4.40s early and then the $4.30s late, down at least five cents from Thursday.

Above-normal temperatures in some parts of the Midcontinent pushed prices into the low-$3.50s, down more than 15 cents from Thursday, with some late deals reported done in the $3.40s.

In west Texas, Permian gas prices were also down about 15 cents in the mid-$3.40s to low-$3.50s as normal to slightly above-normal temperatures were forecast over the next week in the western U.S.

Waha prices were equally higher in the low-to-mid $3.50s.

At the southern California border, traders reported closing deals in the $3.60s, down about 15 cents from Thursday, pressured by mild temperatures and softer western Canadian prices.
