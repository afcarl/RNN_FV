<p>The widow of a fugitive New Jersey prosecutor who committed suicide to avoid prison was sentenced on Friday to 27 months in prison for crimes she committed with her late husband.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Alfred Lechner Jr. showed little leniency in sentencing Barbara Bissell, who faced up to 41 months in prison for her conviction on 13 counts of fraud and other criminal charges.</p>
<p>Her husband Nicholas Bissell, the former Somerset, New Jersey, prosecutor, shot himself on Nov. 26 after federal marshals tracked him down to a motel near Las Vegas, Nevada. Bissell disappeared from his Franklin Township, New Jersey, home on Nov. 18, two days before he was to be sentenced on 30 criminal charges including fraud and official misconduct.</p>
<p>Defence attorneys as well as prosecutors sought leniency for Barbara Bissell, who helped authorities find her husband by tracing his phone calls after he called her on his cellular telephone while he was on the run. She had filed for divorce before her husband fled.</p>
<p>But Lechner said: &quot;We cannot ignore the fact that Mrs. Bissell is a sophisticated woman who fully participated on her own in this series of crimes. She must face justice for her actions.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if she had a statement, Bissell, 43, stood before the judge and said with no visible emotion: &quot;All I have to say is I have made a lot of bad choices in life. I'm very sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>Bissell's lawyer, Rita Donnelly, argued that she had two daughters, aged 13 and 15, who, after the suicide of their father, now face the prospect of a mother in prison. The girls did not attend the sentencing in Newark.</p>
<p>The judge largely rejected their arguments, saying, &quot;Many inner-city women go to prison, leaving children home. Where are their advocates? No one speaks up for them.&quot; He also said he believed Bissell would have been captured without the help from his estranged wife.</p>
<p>The Bissells were convicted of skimming some $146,000 from a gasoline filling station they owned with other partners and using the money to support a lavish lifestyle. The former prosecutor also was convicted of professional corruption and abuse of power, including ordering destruction of a suspect's written request for an attorney.</p>
<p>Bissell was ordered to surrender to authorities on Jan. 31. Should she ever make money from a book or movie deal, she must make restitution of $103,000 to a former partner in the gas station business, who lost his life savings to the couple.</p>
<p>Nicholas Bissell, 49, who was under house arrest, fled after cutting his electronic monitoring bracelet. He faced a likely sentence of 10 years in prison.</p>
