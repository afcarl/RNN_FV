MINNEAPOLIS 1996-12-06

Northwest Airlines said Friday it will offer coach fare discounts of as much as 45 percent to several destinations in Asia.

The Asian cities involved include Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul, Manila, Singapore, Taipei and Bangkok, said Northwest. For example, a mid-week trip between Detroit and Beijing will cost $1062 instead of $1927, said the carrier.

Tickets must be purchased by December 13 and travel must be completed by March 19. Other restrictions apply, said Northwest, which has flown to Asia for 49 years.
