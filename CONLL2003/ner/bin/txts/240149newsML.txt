U.S. T-Bill sector benefits from Greenspan remarks.

An already firm U.S. Treasury bill market got an added boost Friday morning, as investors flocked to the front end in droves seeking cover when stock and bond markets tumbled around the world.

U.S. bill rates fell as much as six basis points Friday morning, while bond yields initiallly jumped 10 basis points.

"People are selling stocks and going (into) short (paper)," said one bill trader at a primary dealership. "There's been some definite asset reallocations."  

Typically, bills are seen as a "safe haven" where investors park money in times of crisis and uncertainty.

Stock and bond prices plunged beginning with the Asian session Friday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested that stock prices might be too high. In a speech Thursday night in Washington, Greenspan said the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets because that could damage the economy.

"Evaluating shifts in balance sheets generally, and in asset prices particularly, must be an integral part of the development of monetary policy," Greenspan said.  

His remarks sent shock waves through international markets, sending Tokyo stocks down three percent and German stocks down more than five percent. The U.K. stock market suffered its worst one-day loss in four years, closing down 88 points.

At one point, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 140 points, before cutting those losses in half by midday.

Bond markets fared no better, with the U.S. Treasury 30-year bond down as much as 1-1/2 points at the New York open.  

But a weaker-than-expected November employment report -- in which nonfarm payrolls rose 118,000 -- calmed the markets and erased much of the losses.

Greenspan spooked the bond market by saying, while inflation has remained low, its "future course remains uncertain."

According to GovPX, volume in the three-month bill was about $1.5 billion by midday -- well above the $571 million average seen on a Friday. The three-month bill rate hit a low of 4.86 percent, a level not seen on an actively traded three-month bill since mid-April.  

Much of the buying was seen in overseas trading during the night. "There was a ... flight-to-quality because investors knew the (U.S.) stock market was going to be hammered," said Richard Schwarz, senior bill trader at Zions First National Bank.

Bills came off their highs slightly by early Friday afternoon, with the three-month bill at 4.88 percent compared with 5.92 percent late Thursday. The six-month bill was down two basis points at 5.01 percent and the year-bill was at 5.16 percent, down one basis point.  

Friday's bill market performance added to the market's stellar performance this week. While coupons were struggling, bills -- especially the three-month -- did well. At times, bills and coupons moved in opposite directions.

Since last Friday, the three-month bill is down 12 basis points, after hovering between 5.01 percent to 5.04 percent for all of November. The 30-year bond, meanwhile, is up 17 basis points from last week to 6.53 percent and the two-year note is up 14 basis points at 5.73 percent.

One bill trader said bills really started to do well after the latest two- and five-year notes settled on Tuesday.

"People started to do window dressing," he said. "It happens every year, but this year it started earlier."

Another trader noted that the latest bill rally may be professionaly driven by a few big dealers. "We've seen some buying," he said. "But not enough to support the recent performance. I wonder if it is not being manipulated by a few large players."
