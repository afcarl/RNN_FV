CHICAGO 1996-12-06

Nebraska cattle markets near midday Friday were extremely quiet, with no sales of slaughter steers or heifers reported, market sources said.

Last sales were Thursday at $112.00 per cwt on a dressed basis, which was steady to $1.00 lower from the bulk of Wednesday's sales. There were some sales of $116.00 near midweek, but they did not last long when beef prices started tumbling, the sources said.

Most of this week's showlist reportedly was sold. The weekly volume was pegged at 83,700 head, according to USDA. Next week's showlist was seen near unchanged, sources said.
