Blue-chip stocks fell more than 140 points before cutting their losses by more than half Friday as the market rebounded from a panic set off by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning about "irrational exuberance" in financial markets.

Shortly after 1 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 51.80, or 0.80 percent, at 6,385.30.

In the broader market, losers overwhelmed gainers by a margin of 22 to three on the New York Stock Exchange on heavy volume of 324 million shares.

The Nasdaq Composite index slid 15.86 points to 1,284.26.

Greenspan said late Thusday that the Fed was keeping a close eye on the financial markets when they were affected by "irrational exuberance" and said that although inflation was low, its future course was uncertain.

Analysts said stock markets, already said to be overbought in light of their recent huge gains, were on a hair trigger.

"In another market, his comments would have been ignored but he made them at a time when the market was extraordinarily vulnerable," said Gary Anderson of Anderson & Loe, a firm that advises money managers.

"The army of of bulls, which had been on a blitzkrieg ... just suddenly ran into machine gun fire," Anderson said.

The comments rocked overseas markets. In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 share index fell 667 points, or 3.2 percent, to 20,277. London's FTSE-100 slumped 88.2 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,963. The dollar also buckled.

U.S. stocks headed downhill at the start of trading. They later began slowly climbing off their lows and stabilised, but at sharply lower levels.

"The worst of it happened earlier and then cooler heads prevailed," said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer for Gruntal & Co.

The activity triggered the New York Stock Exchange's "sidecar" curbs on computerized, index-lined trades for the 11th time this year.

"The short-term stock owners have jumped all over the comments and they are selling. But I view sell-offs like this, where the fundamentals are still the same, as a buying opportunity," Battipaglia said.

"I'm not sure where we will stabilise, but I don't expect (it to get worse) any big correction to happen."

Battipaglia noted that none of the fundamental economic factors underlying the market had changed. "But we are all more nervous now," he said.

Philip Morris Cos Inc. bucked the trend in the Dow, rising 1-5/8 to 109-5/8 after the stock was upgraded by Salomon Brothers analyst Diana Temple. She also said she expected the company to earn even more in 1997 than she previously forecasted.

International Business Machines Corp. shares weighed heavily on the Dow, falling 2-5/8 to 155-3/4 in heavy trading.

CAI Wireless Systems Inc. shares lost almost half their value falling 1-3/16 to 1-9/16 after Bell Atlantic and merger partner Nynex said they would reevaluate their video plans and possibly a $100 million investment in CAI.

The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 6.23 points to 738.15.
