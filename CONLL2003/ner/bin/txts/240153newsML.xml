<p>Blue-chip stocks fell more than 140 points before cutting their losses by more than half Friday as the market rebounded from a panic set off by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning about &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in financial markets.</p>
<p>Shortly after 1 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 51.80, or 0.80 percent, at 6,385.30.</p>
<p>In the broader market, losers overwhelmed gainers by a margin of 22 to three on the New York Stock Exchange on heavy volume of 324 million shares.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index slid 15.86 points to 1,284.26.</p>
<p>Greenspan said late Thusday that the Fed was keeping a close eye on the financial markets when they were affected by &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; and said that although inflation was low, its future course was uncertain.</p>
<p>Analysts said stock markets, already said to be overbought in light of their recent huge gains, were on a hair trigger.</p>
<p>&quot;In another market, his comments would have been ignored but he made them at a time when the market was extraordinarily vulnerable,&quot; said Gary Anderson of Anderson &amp; Loe, a firm that advises money managers.</p>
<p>&quot;The army of of bulls, which had been on a blitzkrieg ... just suddenly ran into machine gun fire,&quot; Anderson said.</p>
<p>The comments rocked overseas markets. In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 share index fell 667 points, or 3.2 percent, to 20,277. London's FTSE-100 slumped 88.2 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,963. The dollar also buckled.</p>
<p>U.S. stocks headed downhill at the start of trading. They later began slowly climbing off their lows and stabilised, but at sharply lower levels.</p>
<p>&quot;The worst of it happened earlier and then cooler heads prevailed,&quot; said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer for Gruntal &amp; Co.</p>
<p>The activity triggered the New York Stock Exchange's &quot;sidecar&quot; curbs on computerized, index-lined trades for the 11th time this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The short-term stock owners have jumped all over the comments and they are selling. But I view sell-offs like this, where the fundamentals are still the same, as a buying opportunity,&quot; Battipaglia said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure where we will stabilise, but I don't expect (it to get worse) any big correction to happen.&quot;</p>
<p>Battipaglia noted that none of the fundamental economic factors underlying the market had changed. &quot;But we are all more nervous now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Philip Morris Cos Inc. bucked the trend in the Dow, rising 1-5/8 to 109-5/8 after the stock was upgraded by Salomon Brothers analyst Diana Temple. She also said she expected the company to earn even more in 1997 than she previously forecasted.</p>
<p>International Business Machines Corp. shares weighed heavily on the Dow, falling 2-5/8 to 155-3/4 in heavy trading.</p>
<p>CAI Wireless Systems Inc. shares lost almost half their value falling 1-3/16 to 1-9/16 after Bell Atlantic and merger partner Nynex said they would reevaluate their video plans and possibly a $100 million investment in CAI.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 6.23 points to 738.15.</p>
