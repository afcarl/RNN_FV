<p>Streamflow reductions tied to fish spawning needs in the Canadian province of British Columbia could cut early January hydropower output at federal dams in the U.S. Northwest, market sources said Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;They want to limit the discharge so that the fish will spawn at low levels that can impact our flow in January,&quot; said a trade source at Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). &quot;But they have to give us an incentive to do that.&quot;</p>
<p>BPA is the federal agency that markets power produced at U.S. hydroelectric projects in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>The cuts are aimed at aiding spawning of whitefish in B.C. -- a process similar to flow cuts on the U.S. portion of the river system which began in early October and ended late last month.</p>
<p>The Columbia River Treaty between the U.S. and Canada does not address shifts in dam flows to accomodate fish, so any flow changes are renegotiated each year.</p>
<p>Under the treaty terms, which depend largely on hydrologic conditions, flows are now around 44,000 to 46,000 cfs, the B.C. Hydro source said.</p>
<p>That will go up to around 85,000 cfs in January, which &quot;is a problem for us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the whitefish continue to spawn in January, there is a danger that eggs would be laid at higher water elevations&quot; and could be exposed if flows fall short of that amount later in the year, the Canadian source said.</p>
<p>Last year, BPA agreed to accept lower treaty flows during January in return for more water released from Canadian reservoirs in the fall of this year, BPA and B.C. Hydro said.</p>
<p>&quot;We may have an agreement in the back pocket, but we won't enter into it unless we have to,&quot; said the B.C. Hydro source.</p>
<p>He noted the whitefish may well be finished with spawning by the end of this month</p>
<p>&quot;This year temperatures are colder. The spawning is triggered by temperatures, so we are hoping it will end sooner,&quot; he added.</p>
