Hungarian Telephone sees access line growth.

STAMFORD, Conn. 1996-12-06

Hungarian Telephone and Cable Corp said on Friday it expected to have 100,000 access lines in place by early 1997, giving the company a penetration level of between 12 percent and 14 percent.

The company said it holds rights to five concession areas in Hungary, with a total population of 715,000 people, and is on schedule to finish the buildout of its network also by the end of 1997.

Hungarian Telephone said it currently has 85,000 telephone access lines in place.

It added that it is the largest private telephone service provider in Hungary outside of the former state-controlled MATAV.
