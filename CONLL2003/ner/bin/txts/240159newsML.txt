U.S. bulk millfeeds -Texas feed mixer demand grows.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

Nearby millfeed values were sharply higher in several central U.S. locations Friday as demand from Texas feed mixers grew and supplies remained tight, several cash dealers said.

"It's still tight nearby and there's several people still looking for nearby (supplies)," one Texas dealer said. "There wasn't anyone buying in this market for a long time and now it's catching up with them."

Tight local supplies forced feed mixers to look elsewhere for millfeeds which lent support to markets as far away as Tennessee and Minnesota, several dealers said.  

"All the other markets around us are doing well and it's starting to rub off," a Chattanooga dealer said. "The market has a better tone to it."

Values also jumped in Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago and Minneapolis, tied largely to the increased demand from Texas.
