<p>Nearby millfeed values were sharply higher in several central U.S. locations Friday as demand from Texas feed mixers grew and supplies remained tight, several cash dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still tight nearby and there's several people still looking for nearby (supplies),&quot; one Texas dealer said. &quot;There wasn't anyone buying in this market for a long time and now it's catching up with them.&quot;</p>
<p>Tight local supplies forced feed mixers to look elsewhere for millfeeds which lent support to markets as far away as Tennessee and Minnesota, several dealers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;All the other markets around us are doing well and it's starting to rub off,&quot; a Chattanooga dealer said. &quot;The market has a better tone to it.&quot;</p>
<p>Values also jumped in Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago and Minneapolis, tied largely to the increased demand from Texas.</p>
