NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Crown Cork & Seal Co Inc expects to issue about $1.2 billion in a multi-tranche debt in the near term, a company spokesman said Friday.

"The timing of the planned $1.2 billion take-down is purely dependent on market conditions," said Craig Calle, SVP-Finance and Treasurer at Crown Cork.

"We are concerned about the increase in Treasury yields today," Calle added.
