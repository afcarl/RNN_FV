SEC asks comment on muni board Q&A on consultants.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

The SEC on Friday requested public comment on guidelines issued last month by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board on the board's "pay-to-play" rule on consultants.

Enacted in March, rule G-38 requires municipal bond dealers to disclose information about their arrangements with the consultants hired to help them find bond business.

The MSRB on November 12 announced a four-part "Questions and Answers" notice on the issue.

Among provisions, the notice reminds bond firms that they must include all fees paid to consultants in the quarterly reports of political activity they must send the board.

That includes not only bonuses, expenses and monthly retainers, but so-called "success fees," the board said. Success fees are payments consultants get for successfully winning a bond deal.

Comments are due December 27 at Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth St., N.W., Wash., D.C. 20549 (File No. SR-MSRB-96-11).
