West Coast packer boosts Midwest hog prices -trade.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

Western Corn Belt terminal hog markets Thursday and early Friday got a surprise price boost from a West Coast meat packer looking for hogs to meet strong seasonal ham demand, cash sources said.

Clougherty Packing of Vernon, Calif., near Los Angeles, reportedly strayed from traditional Colorado and Utah hog markets Thursday and dipped into terminal supplies in western Iowa, sources said.

"We've got guys working seven days a week making hams; we're very production driven," said Ron Smith, director of public relations at the family-owned Clougherty.

At this time of year, Clougherty will buy hogs from the Midwest and truck them to their plant in southern California to meet the seasonal ham demand, Smith said.

The plant has a daily capacity of 5,000 head and has 1,300 employees, Smith said.

"We don't like to do it (ship hogs from the Midwest) because it can be very labor intensive," Smith said.

Cash sources said Clougherty Thursday bought 1,000 head in Sioux City, Iowa, and 2,000 from Sioux Falls, SD.

Smith said he could not comment on the sales activity.

The business raised eyebrows Thursday because terminal markets ended $1.00 per cwt higher in Sioux City at $58.50 and up $0.50 in Sioux Falls at $58.00 after being called steady.

Prices early Friday were seen fully steady in Sioux City, with an estimated 800 receipts and up $0.50 in Sioux Falls, with an estimated 1,200 receipts.
