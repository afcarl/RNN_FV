<p>Western Corn Belt terminal hog markets Thursday and early Friday got a surprise price boost from a West Coast meat packer looking for hogs to meet strong seasonal ham demand, cash sources said.</p>
<p>Clougherty Packing of Vernon, Calif., near Los Angeles, reportedly strayed from traditional Colorado and Utah hog markets Thursday and dipped into terminal supplies in western Iowa, sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got guys working seven days a week making hams; we're very production driven,&quot; said Ron Smith, director of public relations at the family-owned Clougherty.</p>
<p>At this time of year, Clougherty will buy hogs from the Midwest and truck them to their plant in southern California to meet the seasonal ham demand, Smith said.</p>
<p>The plant has a daily capacity of 5,000 head and has 1,300 employees, Smith said.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't like to do it (ship hogs from the Midwest) because it can be very labor intensive,&quot; Smith said.</p>
<p>Cash sources said Clougherty Thursday bought 1,000 head in Sioux City, Iowa, and 2,000 from Sioux Falls, SD.</p>
<p>Smith said he could not comment on the sales activity.</p>
<p>The business raised eyebrows Thursday because terminal markets ended $1.00 per cwt higher in Sioux City at $58.50 and up $0.50 in Sioux Falls at $58.00 after being called steady.</p>
<p>Prices early Friday were seen fully steady in Sioux City, with an estimated 800 receipts and up $0.50 in Sioux Falls, with an estimated 1,200 receipts.</p>
