Agency sees Northeast unit nuclear faults.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Northeast Utilities subsidiary Connecticut Light and Power Co (CL&P) lacked leadership and planning in its administration of its four nuclear power plants, the Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) said Friday.

An independent report commissioned by the DPUC found that CL&P needed to improve employee relations and internal control at the nuclear plants and improve management of financial resources and cost assessment.

CL&P has the largest ownership interest in each of Connecticut's nuclear plants, including a 33 percent interest in Connecticut Yankee, 81 percent in Millstone 1 and 2 and nearly 53 percent of Millstone 3, the DPUC said.

All four of the plants are now closed.

The DPUC said its report, prepared by the Barrington-Wellesley Group, found that Northeast Utilities did not have a properly staffed organization to execute the operation of the plants in a safe, reliable and cost effective manner.

The report also said Northeast Utilities did not yet have a pragmatic, realistic plan for returning its Millstone units to service.

The DPUC said its report is the first of two by the economic regulatory agency on the Northeast nuclear plants.
