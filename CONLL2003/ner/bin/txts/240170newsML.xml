<p>Northeast Utilities subsidiary Connecticut Light and Power Co (CL&amp;P) lacked leadership and planning in its administration of its four nuclear power plants, the Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) said Friday.</p>
<p>An independent report commissioned by the DPUC found that CL&amp;P needed to improve employee relations and internal control at the nuclear plants and improve management of financial resources and cost assessment.</p>
<p>CL&amp;P has the largest ownership interest in each of Connecticut's nuclear plants, including a 33 percent interest in Connecticut Yankee, 81 percent in Millstone 1 and 2 and nearly 53 percent of Millstone 3, the DPUC said.</p>
<p>All four of the plants are now closed.</p>
<p>The DPUC said its report, prepared by the Barrington-Wellesley Group, found that Northeast Utilities did not have a properly staffed organization to execute the operation of the plants in a safe, reliable and cost effective manner.</p>
<p>The report also said Northeast Utilities did not yet have a pragmatic, realistic plan for returning its Millstone units to service.</p>
<p>The DPUC said its report is the first of two by the economic regulatory agency on the Northeast nuclear plants.</p>
