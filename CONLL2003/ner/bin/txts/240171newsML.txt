U.S. tin traders eye Vinto strike amid low stocks.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

A prolonged strike at Bolivia's soon-to-be-privatised Vinto tin smelter will affect metal supplies in the United States within weeks, traders said.

"I don't think anybody has a lot of stock," one producer-linked merchant said.

"The market is in fine balance. The only stocks we have are the LME and the quality is not that good," he added.

Workes at Vinto went on strike Monday after half the workforce were issued with notices to quit, a local union leader said Thursday.

LME tin stocks Friday rose 215 tonnes to 9,735 tonnes. LME three months officially settled at $6,050/$6,055 per tonne on Friday.

LME tin prices actually fell Friday, a victim of further steep losses in the dominant copper contract and jitters following Fed chief Alan Greenspan's comments about the financial markets, traders said.

"In order to have an impact, this strike has to go on for two to four weeks," a dealer noted.

Another trader added, "I don't believe the Indonesians or the Mamore brand can take up the slack."

Mamore is produced by Brazil's Paranapanema.

Vinto is one of the world's key producers of low lead tin, a more expensive grade than the Grade A metal delivered on LME.

But Minsur's new smelter in Peru is producing Grade A and low lead material, a source close to the company said. "We are only producing low lead material to requirements, but we can produce enough if we need to," the source said.

This year Vinto has been toll smelting some 500 tonnes per month of Minsur's concentrates into metal, but this will fall next year as the Peruvian smelter builds up output and will smelt more of its own concentrates.

Many of the U.S. tinplate makers have said they need to use Vinto's material because of environmental regulations governing lead.

Metal from the Bolivian smelter is exported to the U.S. and Europe, handled by a small group of traders.

"If the strike is prolonged, I would not have enough material to meet all my requirements for January," one New York merchant said. "But it's unusual for these strikes to last too long."

However, one rival producer source suggested Vinto workers - and their striking colleagues at the Colquiri and Huanuni mines - have nothing to lose by staying out on strike.

"Most of them will lose their jobs anyway if it is privatised," the source said.

Privatisation is slated for January with four companies short-listed.

Meanwhile all of Vinto's antimony production, expected to total about 5,000 tonnes of contained metal this year, is contraced to Laurel Specialties in the U.S.

Vinto produces crude antimony oxide which Laurel refines into trioxide for fire retardants. A source close to Vinto said Laurel had plenty of supplies in the pipeline and at its Houston plant to keep going "for a few weeks" before being affected.

Vinto is only one source of antimony for Laurel who was recently acquired by Oxidental Chemical Corp. Laurel also has an antimony joint venture in South Africa and buys from China and elsewhere.

Laurel's contract with Vinto extends to August 1998 and would be unaffected if the smelter is privatised, the source said.
