<p>CSX Corp. chugged on to the second leg of its planned railroad merger with Conrail Inc. Friday, launching a $110 per share, $2 billion cash tender offer for 20.1 percent of Conrail shares.</p>
<p>The move, which was expected, followed the filing of a suit Thursday by Conrail and CSX against rival Conrail bidder Norfolk Southern Corp.</p>
<p>The tender announcement came as takeover stock specialists expressed differing opinions about whether Norfolk Southern could prevail with its higher, hostile offer in an increasingly bitter battle.</p>
<p>The CSX deal is worth a total of about $8.6 billion in cash and stock, while Norfolk Southern has offered $10 billion in cash for Conrail.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously Norfolk is still worth more, but in the back of people's minds, people might be saying 'hey, are they ever going to get this deal,'&quot; said one trader. He said stock prices reflected about a 40 percent chance of Norfolk Southern winning.</p>
<p>Said another, &quot;You have Conrail itself suing the highest bidder to make it go away... To me it's an expression of weakness for their position.&quot;</p>
<p>CSX said the tender offer, which follows an initial acquisition of 19.9 percent of Conrail at the same per-share price, would close on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>&quot;With the commencement of this second tender offer, we move another step closer to the completion of the strategic merger of Conrail and CSX and to the realisation of the substantial benefits that this combination will bring to all of our constituencies,&quot; CSX Chairman John Snow said in a statement.</p>
<p>Under a merger agreement between CSX and Conrail, CSX is to swap shares for the remainder of Conrail at a rate of about 1.86 CSX shares per Conrail share. The total value of the bid was about $86.20 per share, or $8.6 billion at Friday's trading prices.</p>
<p>Norfolk Southern is pursuing an all-cash bid of $110 per share, or $10 billion for Conrail. But it has been stymied by numerous provisions in the Conrail-CSX merger agreement designed to block a rival bidder, and by a failure in court to win removal of the provisions.</p>
<p>The battle could be resolved at a Conrail company meeting Dec. 23, at which shareholders will be asked to waive a Pennsylvania law effectively requiring CSX to pay all cash for the deal. The vote is expected to be close, and if the waiver passes, CSX will be in a commanding position.</p>
<p>In suing Norfolk Southern Thursday on charges of improperly interfering with their deal, Conrail and CSX sought to hammer home an argument that Norfolk Southern's offer was not serious and could not succeed due to the &quot;lock up&quot; provisions and court defeat.</p>
<p>Norfolk Southern disputed that, saying that if Conrail would lift the barriers to Norfolk Southern's offer, it would see how serious the rival bidder was.</p>
<p>Conrail has said it was seeking an improved bid from CSX, but stock arbitragers said they did not expect CSX to act unless it became clear ahead of the Conrail meeting that the waiver vote would fail.</p>
<p>Conrail could postpone the meeting if it appeared to lack votes to approve the deal. Shareholders of record as of Dec. 5 can vote at the meeting, meaning CSX can vote the first 19.9 percent stake it acquired.</p>
<p>In response to the tender offer, Norfolk Southern spokesman Bob Fort said the tender was expected but CSX had not used the offer to improve its bid.</p>
<p>&quot;They so far have shown no signs of improving it,&quot; he said. (Corrects spokesman's name from Robert Chapman).</p>
