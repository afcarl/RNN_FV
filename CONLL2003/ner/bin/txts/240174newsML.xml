<title>USA: CAI Wireless Systems Inc debt pummeled.</title>

<p>Debt of U.S. wireless cable concern CAI Wireless Systems Inc toppled more than 20 points on Friday after Bell Atlantic Corp and NYNEX Corp said they will re-evaluate their investment in the company, traders said.</p>
<p>The debt traded down in steady increments from Thursday's close of 75 bid, 78 offer to a wide 50 bid, 60 offer market near mid-session.</p>
<p>Commerce for the debt was moderate early in the session, but traders said little paper changed hands as the day dragged on indicating holders were still making bets on CAI.  </p>
<p>Bell Atlantic and NYNEX cited the disappointing results from CAI for offering video to homes spurred the reexamination of their strategy. The two Bells have invested $100 million in CAI, which plans to use microwave signals, beamed by line of sight to wall-mounted receivers, to deliver television signals.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a culmination of what we've been seeing for the past month and a half which is increasing evidence regional Bell companies were backing away from wireless cables as a technology,&quot; said Les Levi, telecom and media analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co Inc.  </p>
<p>Talk that Bell Atlantic and NYNEX were eyeing an investment in American Sky Broadcasting has been reflected in CAI prices for weeks, Levi said. American Sky Broadcasting is a venture between News Corp Ltd and MCI Communications Corp.</p>
<p>Levi also noted that a recent trial of CAI's technology in the Boston, Massachusetts area proved disappointing from the regional Bells' viewpoint.</p>
<p>Bell Atlantic said it and NYNEX may reevaluate the method of getting video to homes. They have not said anything specific regarding the investment in CAI.  </p>
<p>Looking ahead, Levi sees an uncertain and turbulent road for the wireless cable concerns for the next month or two when &quot;more comprehensive rollouts&quot; of the technology are due.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't see any likely transactions in the sector that would reinforce confidence in the technology,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;Once the digital technology is deployed it will demonstrate the strength of the platform,&quot; but until then the sector will be extremely volatile and speculative.</p>
<p>The industry will need strategic partners, he said, but it's clear at the moment that there aren't any (regional Bells) that will step up with the exception of Bell South which is &quot;quietly doing acquisitions.&quot;</p>
<p>CAI stock dropped 1-1/8 t0 1-5/8 after the New York Times first reported the Bell's move.</p>
