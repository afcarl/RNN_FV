U.S. swap spreads slightly wider on rate outlook.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

Spreads on U.S. interest rate swaps were slightly wider across the board Friday in the wake of increased expectations for a Fed rate hike, dealers said.

Remarks by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan in a speech here Thursday night were seen as bearish for bonds and pushed down financial markets around the globe. U.S. interest rates jumped but later recovered on weak employment data.

The impact on swaps was greatest at the short end. Spreads on two-year swaps widened by two to three basis points. Dealers quoted the two-year at 19 to 20 basis points bid, 22 basis points offered.  

On three-year swaps, spreads were quoted at 22 basis points bid, 24 to 25 basis points offered, also a few basis points wider in the wake of the Greenspan speech.

All the widening could reverse quickly as the market reassesses Greenspan's comments, dealers said. The chairman was scheduled to speak in Philadelphia Friday afternoon.

"This is not what I would call a major market break," one New York-based swap dealer said. The market has returned to its year-old trading ranges after every recent break, usually in only a few days, the dealer added.  

On five-year swaps, spreads were quoted one to two basis points wider at 24 to 25 basis points bid, 27 basis points offered.

At the long end, 10-year swaps were quoted at 33 basis points bid, 34 to 35 basis points offered, also one to two basis points wider.
