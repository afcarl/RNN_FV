<p>Spreads on U.S. interest rate swaps were slightly wider across the board Friday in the wake of increased expectations for a Fed rate hike, dealers said.</p>
<p>Remarks by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan in a speech here Thursday night were seen as bearish for bonds and pushed down financial markets around the globe. U.S. interest rates jumped but later recovered on weak employment data.</p>
<p>The impact on swaps was greatest at the short end. Spreads on two-year swaps widened by two to three basis points. Dealers quoted the two-year at 19 to 20 basis points bid, 22 basis points offered.  </p>
<p>On three-year swaps, spreads were quoted at 22 basis points bid, 24 to 25 basis points offered, also a few basis points wider in the wake of the Greenspan speech.</p>
<p>All the widening could reverse quickly as the market reassesses Greenspan's comments, dealers said. The chairman was scheduled to speak in Philadelphia Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not what I would call a major market break,&quot; one New York-based swap dealer said. The market has returned to its year-old trading ranges after every recent break, usually in only a few days, the dealer added.  </p>
<p>On five-year swaps, spreads were quoted one to two basis points wider at 24 to 25 basis points bid, 27 basis points offered.</p>
<p>At the long end, 10-year swaps were quoted at 33 basis points bid, 34 to 35 basis points offered, also one to two basis points wider.</p>
