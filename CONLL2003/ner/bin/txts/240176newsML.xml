<title>USA: Moody's cuts San Diego GO bond rating to Aa1.</title>
<headline>Moody's cuts San Diego GO bond rating to Aa1.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Moody's Investors Service on Friday said that it cut the rating on the city's general obligation bonds to Aa1 from Aaa, citing a lack financial flexibility.</p>
<p>The rating agency added that it lowered the rating on the general obligation bonds of the San Diego Park Facility District No. 1 to Aa1 from Aaa. It said that while the credit quality of the city's outstanding lease obligations has fallen, the ratings on this debt was confirmed at Aa.  </p>
<p>The primary reason for the rating downgrades is the reduction in financial flexibility resulting from a series of recent political and legal developments, most notably the approval of Proposition 218 by the state's voters on Nov. 5.</p>
<p>At the same time, all of San Diego's ratings recognize that its historically strong financial management and low tax rates position the city relatively well to deal with future fiscal challenges.  In addition, the near-term impact of Proposition 218 on San Diego is minimal, less than on many other cities.</p>
<p>The Series 1996A Lease Revenue Bonds have been assigned a rating of A1.  The rating distinction between the 1996A bonds and the city's other lease obligations reflects the less essential nature of the leased asset -- Jack Murphy Stadium -- and the uncertainty of stadium revenues.</p>
<p>Moody's ratings on the general obligation and lease debt of the other large cities in California are under review as a result of the passage of Proposition 218.  These reviews are expected to be completed in the next several weeks. Key factors in the San Diego rating action include:</p>
<p>Political and Legal Trends Reduce Local Governments' Financial Flexibility</p>
<p>A series of recent developments in California have accelerated a reduction in local governments' financial flexibility, which began with the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978.  </p>
<p>The most notable of these developments was the Nov. 5 adoption of Proposition 218 by the state's voters.  Other key events were the State Supreme Court's 1995 rulings in Rossi v. Brown and Guardino v. Santa Clara.</p>
<p>Over time, these changes, and the political and legal environment that fostered them, will limit the city's options for dealing with new pressures as they emerge in the future. Financial Management Has Been Consistently Strong</p>
<p>In recent years, financial operations have remained balanced despite the diversion of revenues by the state, the stagnation of tax receipts during the prolonged recession, and the decision to add more police officers.</p>
<p>The city has generally dealt with fiscal pressures without resorting to tax or fee increases.  Rates for most taxes and fees are the lowest of any large city in the state.  These factors position the city relatively well to deal with the growing limitations on its financial flexibility. Reserves Are Small</p>
<p>Unaudited results for fiscal 1996 show an undesignated fund balance of $11.6 million or 2.3% of revenues; total fund balance equal $28.8 million or 5.8% of revenues.  The limited size of these reserves will be a constraining factor as officials face financial pressures in the future. Immediate Impact of Proposition 218 Appears Minimal, Less Than Other Cities</p>
<p>None of San Diego's existing revenues appear vulnerable to these provisions.  The city does not make any transfers from its enterprises to its General Fund, and has not imposed or increased any general taxes since 1994.  It imposes no city-wide operating assessments that need to be reauthorized under the new procedures. The City's Economy is Diverse and Growing</p>
<p>San Diego suffered less from the recent recession than other parts of the state, and its significant military presence has actually grown as a result of base closures elsewhere.  The economy has become increasingly diversified with strong growth in tourism, international trade, high technology manufacturing, and professional services. Debt Levels Are Low; Future Borrowing Plans Are Significant, but Manageable</p>
<p>Although the current offering increases the city's debt levels, they remain relatively low.  The city plans to issue $263 million in lease rental bonds in the next year for various projects.  The full impact of these additional borrowings has not been evaluated at this time, but debt levels should remain manageable.</p>
