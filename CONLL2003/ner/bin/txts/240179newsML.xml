<headline>NYC Hevesi says debt service may hit $3 bln in '97.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>The New York City comptroller on Friday estimated that the city's debt service costs could soar to $3 billion in fiscal year 1997, nearly double the $1.8 billion amount it paid 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Alan Hevesi, who projected debt service would climb to $3.7 billion in fiscal year 2000, absorbing 18.5 percent of tax revenues, noted that this rising cost will reduce how much money New York City can spend on crucial functions.</p>
<p>&quot;That means the city will have to spend a greater portion of its funds on repaying debt, and will have less for police, education, health and other vital services,&quot; he said, in prepared remarks.</p>
<p>The comptroller, who also recommended steps that the city could take to avoid hitting its constitutional debt limit until the end of fiscal year 1997, was releasing a report on the city's debt that is mandated by the charter.</p>
<p>New York City's debt limit, which is based on a five-year average of real estate values, has fallen 41 percent in the last two years, mainly because of the built-in lag between declines and rebounds in property prices. The city's property values were hurt by a sharp local recession, which lasted from 1989 until mid-1993.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 1997, which ends on June 30, the debt cap is expected to fall to $31.9 billion, down from $53.8 billion in fiscal year 1995.</p>
<p>Nor will that be the lowest level that likely will be hit: Hevesi projected the debt ceiling will drop to $30.7 billion in fiscal year 1998.</p>
<p>The city's borrowing capacity as of September 30, 1996, had fallen to $888.5 million.</p>
<p>The steps that the comptroller recommended to delay New York City from hitting the debt cap until the end of its 1997 fiscal year include readjusting city contracts to find another $500 million, and not counting this year the full $500 million of a proposed four-year transaction with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p>
<p>Hevesi also urged that a $10.9 billion debt cap be imposed on the new infrastructure authority that the Giuliani Administration has proposed to sidestep the constitutional debt limit.</p>
<p>The state legislature would have to approve the new borrowing authority, which would sell bonds to pay for education and transportation projects, and it is not expected to take the issue up until early 1997.</p>
<p>However, the comptroller urged that the amount of debt that the new infrastructure agency could issue should decline as the city's debt ceiling rebounds. &quot;Our goal is to preserve the city's essential capital projects, not to give the city the absolute freedom ot issue debt,&quot; he said, in prepared remarks.</p>
<p>Hevesi said his office had approved a plan for the city to issue about $625 million of debt that will be used to buy around $600 million of city bonds held by the Municipal Assistance Corp, which was set up in the mid-1980s to rescue the city from its financial crisis.</p>
<p>City officials have said they expect to the bond sale, which creates more room under the debt cap, through a syndicate led by Lehman Brothers during the week of December 16.</p>
