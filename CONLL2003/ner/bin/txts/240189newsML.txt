Scholastic Corp said Friday it filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell up to $150 million in debt securities and preferred and common stock.

The debt securities may be either senior debt securities or subordinated debt securities, the New York-based company said in the filing.

Net proceeds from the sale of the securities will be added to the company's general funds and used for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of indebtedness, capital expenditures and possible acquisitions.

Scholastic is a publisher and distributor of children's books, classroom and professional magazines and other educational materials.
