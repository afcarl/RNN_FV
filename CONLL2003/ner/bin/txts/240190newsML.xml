<p>Sounding the increasingly familiar mantra that U.S. stocks are overpriced and due for a fall, international mutual fund managers are touting foreign markets as safe havens next year, singling out Europe as one region to find reasonable prices.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there's a whole lot of upside in the U.S. market,&quot; said Michael Levy, managing director at Bankers Trust New York Corp and portfolio manager of the $200 million BT International Equity Fund.  </p>
<p>&quot;I'm not going to tell you it's going to crash in six months, but there's no question we've come through a long period of outperforming,&quot; Levy said. &quot;It's probably slated for a rest period.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. stocks fell sharply in early trading on Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; could infect stock markets and harm the economy.</p>
<p>The Dow Industrials index, which closed at a record high on November 25, fell more than 140 points in early trade before recouping a bit.  </p>
<p>Managers of value funds, who scour the markets for cheap U.S. equities, are finding the search difficult. Overseas markets appear to offer more fertile ground.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't see valuations floating that much higher,&quot; said Richard Dahlberg, head of U.S. equities for Salomon Brothers Asset Management. &quot;Valuation and selection are the key.&quot;</p>
<p>If U.S. stocks suffer through a severe correction in 1997 and drag U.S. funds down with them, international funds are expected to offer high ground, especially with what managers see as &quot;attractive relative valuations.&quot;  </p>
<p>Levy of Bankers Trust said his fund will be overweight in continental Europe. &quot;We expect that the combination of loose monetary policy and tight fiscal policy will be a cocktail that will be favorable to the region,&quot; he said. He especially likes defensive stocks like utilities and financial services.</p>
<p>The lure of Europe is also due in part to conservative balance sheets and accounting practices by corporations, which value assets more fairly and take more conservative reserves for potentially bad businesses, managers said.</p>
<p>Henry Frantzen, executive vice president of Federated Investors, is broadly bullish on global markets.  </p>
<p>Frantzen said he expects &quot;good&quot; corporate profit growth in Europe next year, with shares rising 13-20 percent.</p>
<p>In Asia, excluding Japan, he sees 15 percent growth in both stocks and profits. &quot;Values are very cheap,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In Japan, he forecasts the economic recovery &quot;will pick up&quot; next year, with the yen strengthening. He expects stocks to jump 25-30 percent.</p>
<p>Jolanta Wysocka, who manages Federated Emerging Markets Fund, said that among emerging markets, Eastern Europe, especially Poland, the Czech Republic and some of the former Soviet republics, is expected to be ripe for stock-picking.  </p>
<p>Rick White, senior portfolio manager at Salomon Asset Management, likes Canadian stocks, notably the railroads. He is especially bullish on Canadian National Railway Corp and Canadian Pacific Ltd in 1997.</p>
<p>Before today's pullback, the S&amp;P 500 Index had risen about 20 percent in the year to date, the Dow Industrials had gained about 23 percent, and the small-stock Russell 2000 had added about 15 percent.</p>
<p>Year to date, international funds have returned about 11 percent, while U.S. equity funds have gained about 20 percent.</p>
<p>In 1995, international funds returned 9.41 percent, and U.S. equity funds gained 31.26 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services.</p>
