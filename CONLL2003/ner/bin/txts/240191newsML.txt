Calif. Senator proposes earned income tax credit.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. 1996-12-06

California state Senator Hilda Solis said on Thursday she introduced legislation that would establish a state earned income tax credit.

Solis, a Democrat from El Monte, said the proposed state earned income tax credit would supplement the low wages that many workers earn.

She said the tax credit, modeled after federal law, would be subtracted from the amount of state tax owed. Many workers would receive a refund, Solis said.
