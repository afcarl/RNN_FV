BG&E power plant gets favorable NRC report.

BALTIMORE 1996-12-06

Baltimore Gas and Electric Co said its Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant received top ratings in three of four areas assessed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

In the NRC's survey that takes place every 18 months, the power plant received the agency's top ratings for operations, engineering and plant support and an "average" rating in maintenance, the company said.

"Management actions consistently reflected a strong safety perspective," the company quoted from the report. "Operator performance continued to be strong an appropriately focused on reactor safety."

The report covered a period from May 14, 1995 to October 19, 1996, the company said.

Baltimore Gas and Electric said the report noted some equipment liability problems affected plant operations and stronger oversight and control of off-site maintenance work groups is needed. The company said it is addressing these concerns.
