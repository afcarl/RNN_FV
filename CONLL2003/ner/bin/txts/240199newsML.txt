NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Corporate bond issuance is expected to taper off on Friday as underwriters take to their drawing boards and structure some new deals for next week, syndicate sources said.

"It's going to be a very quiet day," said one high grade syndicate source. "Issuers are keeping a low profile today but a few names are being worked on for next week."

Among the deals being worked on for next week is Crown Cork & Seal Inc's expected $1.0 billion multi-tranche debt offering via Salomon Brothers Inc, sources said.  

Deutsche Bank is also getting set to issue $1.0 billion in Aa1/AA-plus rated 10-year yankee debt via lead manager Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, sources said.

Dealers said unofficial price talk on Deutsche's yankee issue was seen in the low 50's (basis points) area.

A deal by Nike Inc is also in the works for next week business, sources said.

The debt offering is expected to consist of $150 million in seven-year debt via lead manager Goldman Sachs & Co.  

"The demand for corporate paper continues to be there," said one dealer. "Issuers are going to take advantage of that demand during this favorable rate environment."

This week, close to $3.0 billion in straight corporate debt priced in the corporate bond primary market, dealers said.
