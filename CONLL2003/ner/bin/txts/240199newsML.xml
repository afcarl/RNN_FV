<p>Corporate bond issuance is expected to taper off on Friday as underwriters take to their drawing boards and structure some new deals for next week, syndicate sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be a very quiet day,&quot; said one high grade syndicate source. &quot;Issuers are keeping a low profile today but a few names are being worked on for next week.&quot;</p>
<p>Among the deals being worked on for next week is Crown Cork &amp; Seal Inc's expected $1.0 billion multi-tranche debt offering via Salomon Brothers Inc, sources said.  </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank is also getting set to issue $1.0 billion in Aa1/AA-plus rated 10-year yankee debt via lead manager Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, sources said.</p>
<p>Dealers said unofficial price talk on Deutsche's yankee issue was seen in the low 50's (basis points) area.</p>
<p>A deal by Nike Inc is also in the works for next week business, sources said.</p>
<p>The debt offering is expected to consist of $150 million in seven-year debt via lead manager Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.  </p>
<p>&quot;The demand for corporate paper continues to be there,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;Issuers are going to take advantage of that demand during this favorable rate environment.&quot;</p>
<p>This week, close to $3.0 billion in straight corporate debt priced in the corporate bond primary market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Still, several other deals are set to come to market in the following weeks, syndicate sources said.</p>
<p>Capital One Financial Corp is expected to set $125 million in seven-year debt via Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette Securities.  </p>
<p>Union Central Life is expected to tap the market with a $500 million two-part debt offering, sources added.</p>
<p>AES China Generating Co is expected to issue $180 million in a 10-year senior note offering via Morgan Stanely. Initial talk on the size of the deal was $150 million, dealers said.</p>
<p>Turning to the high-yield primary sector, a slew of new issues are set to come to market near term, dealers added.</p>
<p>AK Steel Corp is getting set to bring $550 million in 10-year 144A senior notes via CS First Boston, dealers said.</p>
<p>Phonetel Tech is expected to issue $110 million in senior notes due 2006 via JP Morgan Securities.</p>
