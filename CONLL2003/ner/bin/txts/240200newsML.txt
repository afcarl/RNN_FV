U.S. crudes tumble on Iraq, French strike news.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

U.S. cash crudes tumbled Friday on news of Iraq's imminent return to the market and signs that the strike at three French refineries may be winding down, traders said.

U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali will give the green light Monday to start Iraqi oil sales, completing implementation of the long-delayed oil-for-food accord, a senior U.N. official said Friday.

January West Texas Intermediate/Cushing was trading around $25.10-20 a barrel, down 45 cents from late Thursday's cash market.  

Workers voted on Friday to end a strike at one out of three Elf Aquitaine refineries in France which have been crippled by a nine-day protest over proposed job cuts, union officials said.

The 98,000 barrels per day (bpd) Granpuits facility will resume operations this weekend, they said.

Workers at the two other plants were still voting Friday morning on whether to end their walkouts.

Grade business was light Friday morning, with only three deals heard done.

Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James picked up slightly to WTI/Cushing plus 90-93 cts a barrel, with the grade changing hands at 91 and 92 cts, traders said.

Heavy Louisiana Sweet/Empire remained in the doldrums at 40-47 cts over WTI/Cushing, with one deal heard done at 41 cents.

WTI/Midland was flat at 1-2 cents over WTI/Cushing.

West Texas Sour/Midland also held steady at $1.88-83 a barrel below WTI/Cushing.

Traders pondered how much impact the Iraqi news would have once exports actually begin.

"Whether the price continues to drop, we just don't know. There could be another $1 downside when Iraqi oil comes out," one trader said.
