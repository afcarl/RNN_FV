<p>U.S. cash crudes tumbled Friday on news of Iraq's imminent return to the market and signs that the strike at three French refineries may be winding down, traders said.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali will give the green light Monday to start Iraqi oil sales, completing implementation of the long-delayed oil-for-food accord, a senior U.N. official said Friday.</p>
<p>January West Texas Intermediate/Cushing was trading around $25.10-20 a barrel, down 45 cents from late Thursday's cash market.  </p>
<p>Workers voted on Friday to end a strike at one out of three Elf Aquitaine refineries in France which have been crippled by a nine-day protest over proposed job cuts, union officials said.</p>
<p>The 98,000 barrels per day (bpd) Granpuits facility will resume operations this weekend, they said.</p>
<p>Workers at the two other plants were still voting Friday morning on whether to end their walkouts.</p>
<p>Grade business was light Friday morning, with only three deals heard done.</p>
<p>Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James picked up slightly to WTI/Cushing plus 90-93 cts a barrel, with the grade changing hands at 91 and 92 cts, traders said.</p>
<p>Heavy Louisiana Sweet/Empire remained in the doldrums at 40-47 cts over WTI/Cushing, with one deal heard done at 41 cents.</p>
<p>WTI/Midland was flat at 1-2 cents over WTI/Cushing.</p>
<p>West Texas Sour/Midland also held steady at $1.88-83 a barrel below WTI/Cushing.</p>
<p>Traders pondered how much impact the Iraqi news would have once exports actually begin.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether the price continues to drop, we just don't know. There could be another $1 downside when Iraqi oil comes out,&quot; one trader said.</p>
