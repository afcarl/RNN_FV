NYC Hevesi urges steps to delay hitting debt cap.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi on Friday recommended some short-term steps that the city could take to avoid hitting its constitutional debt limit until the end of the 1997 fiscal year on June 30.

The comptroller's recommendations include asking the state legislature to approve a new infrastructure agency that could borrow up to $10.9 billion, about half of the borrowing capacity the city has lost as its debt cap has fallen.  

The comptroller added his staff and the Giuliani Administration's budget officials have agreed to review the amount of registered contracts.

This could produce up to $500 million that could be used to cut the amount counted under the debt limit, Hevesi said. He previously had estimated the maneuver might identify an additional $1 billion.

Hevei noted the city's plan to pay the Metropolitan Transportation Authority $500 million in capital funds over four years in return for a short-term cash infusion does not require it to sell debt. So all of the $500 million might not have to be counted in the debt limit this year.

The comptroller's recommendations were included in a report on the city's debt that is mandated by the charter.
