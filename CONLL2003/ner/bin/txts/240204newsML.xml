<p>Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is likely to give clearance for the start of the Iraqi oil-for-food plan as early as Monday, paving the way for Baghdad to enter world oil markets for the first time in six years, senior U.N. officials said.</p>
<p>Although Boutros-Ghali himself was cautious in predicting any start date, the officials said the Dutch-based Saybolt firm late on Friday found Iraqi pipeline equipment in order, the last technical obstacle left before the plan's implementation.</p>
<p>At issue is Security Council resolution 986 that allows Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to buy food, medicine and other necessities for its people, suffering from the sanctions imposed in August 1990 after its troops invaded Kuwait.</p>
<p>Nearly two-thirds of oil sales revenues are earmarked for needy Iraqis, with the balance for war reparations and other Gulf War-related costs.</p>
<p>Saybolt told the United Nations that key oil metering equipment was in &quot;functional&quot; order at the Zakho facility along the Turkey-Iraq border, through which the bulk of the oil will pass, a U.N. official said.</p>
<p>Their inspectors had previously found some of the equipment faulty or missing, requiring a return visit this week to ensure repairs had been carried out.</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali earlier on Friday said he was awaiting the Saybolt report before making a determination on when he would give clearance for the start of Iraqi oil sales, shying away from giving an exact date for starting the plan.</p>
<p>&quot;When I receive it I will have a meeting and on the basis of this meeting we will decide (when the clearance for oil sales can be given),&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>The procedure is for Boutros-Ghali to give a one-page report to the council after which the deal can go ahead a minute past midnight, New York time, on the following day.</p>
<p>At U.N. headquarters, a group of oil experts or overseers who first need to approve any contracts before Iraq can start shipping the oil, are returning to New York next week, an indication the deal was being readied.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still iffy on the timing,&quot; U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said. &quot;Obviously we are getting closer to the magic moment for the implementation of resolution 986. But we cannot pinpoint with any accuracy when he will be able to transmit the final report to the Council.&quot;</p>
<p>Iraqi Oil Minister General Amir Muhammad Rasheed said oil experts would start Tuesday. But, U.N. officials downplayed the timing, noting the work schedule for the overseers was not settled and oil contracts can take up to 24 hours for review.</p>
<p>Iraq and the United Nations signed the terms for the oil-for-food deal on May 20, but implementation has been a lengthy process, and was actually suspended in early September after Iraqi troop incursions into northern Kurdish regions of the country.</p>
<p>However, all political obstacles were removed on November 25, when Iraq dropped demands for control of key aspects for the monitoring the deal on the ground, and other details.</p>
<p>Before invading Kuwait, Iraq exported more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd). Considering current world oil prices, Iraqi oil exports would amount to under 600,000 bpd, according to the oil deal plan.</p>
