Four African candidates were nominated on Friday for the post of U.N. Secretary-General, thereby breaking a deadlock after Boutros Boutros-Ghali temporarily put aside his bid for re-election.

Italian Ambassador Paolo Fulci said the nominees were:

-- Kofi Annan of Ghana, the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping, who has held a variety of top-level U.N. posts.

-- Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania, the former U.N. special representative for Burundi who is co-chairman of the Global Coalition for Africa group in Washington.

-- Hamid Algabid of Niger, the secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference.

-- Amara Essy of the Ivory Coast, its foreign minister and the U.N. General Assembly president in 1994-95, who recently brokered a peace agreement ending five years of civil war in Sierre Leone.

The council will decide on Monday when they will take an informal poll to see how much support the candidates have.

The move by the African states means the council could begin voting on candidates next week, a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee.

By then diplomats said other names would probably emerge, including Salim A. Salim of Tanzania, the secretary-general of the Organisation of Africa Unity, and possibly Olara Ottunu, the president of the New York-based International Peace Academy, as well as Senegal's foreign minister Moustapha Niasse, said to be in New York for the purpose.

Also mentioned as possible candidate was Wally N'Dow of Gambia, an assistant secretary-general in charge of the Centre for Human Settlements in Nairobi.

All four names were put in letters to Fulci, who met ambassadors from the four nations involved as well as Jerome Mendougu, Cameroon's ambassador to the United States. Cameroon holds the presidency of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).

Both Senegal and Gambia this year sponsored General Assembly resolution backing U.N. membership for Taiwan, making them liable to a  veto from China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province.

Boutros-Ghali's five-year term expires on Dec. 31.

On Wednesday he opened the door for other Africans to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race.

His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate should the reace reach an impasse.

The United States on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 Security Council members supported him. In July he received the backing of the Organisation of African Unity.

U.S. officials maintain he has not reformed the organisation but most diplomats believe the Clinton administration was bowing to pressure from Republicans in Congress, many of whom are opposed to the United Nations on philosophical grounds.

the New York Times reported that the Clinton administration had offered Boutros-Ghali his own foundation to run and the new title of secretary-general emeritus if he would step down.

But he rejected the offer made during a private dinner with U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright on Nov. 19.
