French policeman probed for Basque separatist ties.

PARIS 1996-12-06

A French policeman was formally placed under investigation on Friday on suspicion of collaborating with the Basque separatist movement, judicial sources said.

They said an anti-terrorism magistrate had ordered Jean-Luc Malet, a police officer in the southern port city of Marseille, to be held in custody in Paris while the investigation proceeded. Malet has denied any wrongdoing, the sources said.

Malet, who had been posted in Paris before his transfer to Marseille, had been in custody since his arrest at his Marseille home on Tuesday morning.

The sources said the officer's name had turned up in documents and on a computer disc seized after the arrest last July in France of Basque ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) rebel leader Julian Achurra Egurola, also known as "Pototo"

ETA has killed some 800 people in the 28 years it has been struggling for Basque independence.

In a related action, police earlier on Friday detained but later released four people after searches of suspected Basque separatist homes in a village in southwestern France, police sources said.

Police targeted two houses and three flats in the village of Sare in the Pyrenees Atlantiques region believed linked to ETA.

The four were freed several hours later with police apparently having little to show for the raids.

The sources said that the searches had been based on other documents that had been in Egurola's possession at the time of his arrest.

The searches came three days after police found 36 anti-tank rockets in Pau, in the same area.
