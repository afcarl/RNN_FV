<p>A French policeman was formally placed under investigation on Friday on suspicion of collaborating with the Basque separatist movement, judicial sources said.</p>
<p>They said an anti-terrorism magistrate had ordered Jean-Luc Malet, a police officer in the southern port city of Marseille, to be held in custody in Paris while the investigation proceeded. Malet has denied any wrongdoing, the sources said.</p>
<p>Malet, who had been posted in Paris before his transfer to Marseille, had been in custody since his arrest at his Marseille home on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>The sources said the officer's name had turned up in documents and on a computer disc seized after the arrest last July in France of Basque ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) rebel leader Julian Achurra Egurola, also known as &quot;Pototo&quot;</p>
<p>ETA has killed some 800 people in the 28 years it has been struggling for Basque independence.</p>
<p>In a related action, police earlier on Friday detained but later released four people after searches of suspected Basque separatist homes in a village in southwestern France, police sources said.</p>
<p>Police targeted two houses and three flats in the village of Sare in the Pyrenees Atlantiques region believed linked to ETA.</p>
<p>The four were freed several hours later with police apparently having little to show for the raids.</p>
<p>The sources said that the searches had been based on other documents that had been in Egurola's possession at the time of his arrest.</p>
<p>The searches came three days after police found 36 anti-tank rockets in Pau, in the same area.</p>
