Belgium decides measures to shake up the law.

The Belgian government announced a raft of new measures on Friday designed to tighten the justice system and restore public confidence following a child sex and murder scandal that revealed police and judicial bungling.

Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene announced the measures, including more help to victims and tougher laws on parole, after a day-long cabinet meeting to review the legal system.

"All these measures...and others mark a real shake up which aims to make the law work," Dehaene told a news conference.

Belgians had been outraged by revelations of a catalogue of past police and judicial errors during the scandal, which centred on investigations into a paedophile ring.

These included lack of coordination between rival districts and the fact that chief suspect Marc Dutroux was a convicted child rapist let out of jail early.

At least gour girls died in the horrific child sex, kidnapping and murder cases.

Dehaene said his centre-left government had promised new measures to the parents of the victims and was now fulfilling those pledges, but it had been aware of the system's shortcomings before the "Dutroux affair" blew up in August.

"The government has not improvised today. If it has been able to present projects quickly it is because they were already being prepared, which shows the government was aware of the dysfunctioning and problems of the law," he said.

The government decided victims would get similar rights to the person charged with a crime, and also a true place in the police inquiry and in the penal process.

Bereaved parents in the Dutroux affair complained bitterly of being left out in the cold by investigators looking for their daughters who were missing for over a year. Two mothers said they were not even allowed to identify the girls' remains.

The government also approved a draft law to create six commissions to deal with requests for early conditional release from jail, designed to "better protect society" and take the final decision out of a justice minister's hands.

Two judges and two assessors -- a specialist in sentencing and another in social reintegration -- would head a commission. With sentences of 10 years or more, or if less than half a term had been served, it would have to give a unanimous decision.

Dutroux was released in 1992 on parole, 10 years before the end of a 13 year sentence.

There were also measures to integrate often rival police services, as well as proposals to make the promotions of magistrates less political and to assess them better.

Belgian magistrates were wary of reform and on Thursday the Cour de Cassation, Belgium's highest court, sent a sharp letter to the government, complaining that the courts themselves were not involved in the government's review of the system.

Dehaene said magistrates' suggestions had been taken into account. The proposals that affected them would be passed on to the judicial authorities and to parliament. The government would meet the head of the magistrature later.

The Cour de Cassation was the focus of a wave of public anger in October after it decided to remove a popular magistrate, Jean-Marc Connerotte, from the paedophile murder investigation for accepting a plate of spaghetti at a solidarity evening for families of the victims.

Connerotte's removal was followed by a "White March" when a quarter of a million people filed through Brussels in support of the child victims' families and to show their concern over the law and order system.
