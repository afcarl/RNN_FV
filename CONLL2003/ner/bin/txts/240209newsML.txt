Italy graftbuster Di Pietro target of police raids.

Police on Friday raided the homes and offices of Antonio Di Pietro, a former minister and the most popular man in Italy for his judicial assault on corruption.

Italian media reported that some 300 agents were involved in the raids, ordered by magistrates in the northern town of Brescia who are probing alleged irregularities by Di Pietro when he was a star anti-graft magistrate.

His attorney, Massimo Dinoia, told Reuters that agents had seized a number of legal documents on various subjects from Di Pietro's home in the town of Curno, near Milan.

Dinoia said Di Pietro, who returned to Milan from Rome on Friday morning, was not present, but added that his wife and two small children had been awakened by police.

"His only worry is that he won't be able to defend himself because they have seized these documents," said parliamentarian Elio Veltri, a friend who spoke with Di Pietro on Friday.

Italian media said police conducted about 50 raids of which around 10 were in Rome. They fell on the second anniversary of Di Pietro's unexpected departure from the judiciary.

"I was surprised, negatively surprised...I think my state of mind is the same as that of many Italians who heard the news on the radio," far-right leader Gianfranco Fini said.

"If Brescia magistrates have ordered this wave of searches, it must have its reasons...The hope is that this case is cleared up definitively as soon as possible."

In another twist, media reports late on Friday said Rome prosecutors had ordered an inquiry into Di Pietro's use of a private plane while still a minister on what parliamentarians said may have been personal business in northern Italy.

Friday's searches, carried out by special finance police investigators and comparable to large-scale Mafia raids, also targeted several of Di Pietro's business associates and lawyers.

Brescia magistrates would not comment on the case.

"Exactly two years ago Di Pietro announced his resignation and today we have this nice little present," Dinoia said. Di Pietro quit soon after Milan magistrates placed then-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi under investigation amid rumours that he was forced out. He has never fully explained his decision.

Berlusconi's brother Paolo and his defence minister Cesare Previti are both on trial in Brescia accused of plotting to discredit Di Pietro. They deny the charges.

The Di Pietro investigation began last month, prompting him to quit the post as public works minister he took on in May in the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi.

In his resignation letter, Di Pietro said the probe was a "pigeon shoot", implying it was part of what he has portrayed as a vendetta by defendants he helped expose in his investigations.

"This is sort of like the Stations of the Cross," Veltri said, referring to the events in Christ's crucifixion.

Di Pietro, 46, was the star investigator of the elite "Clean Hands" anti-graft team in Milan, which from 1992 launched a series of probes that destroyed Italy's political establishment.

The probes uncovered widespread payments of bribes by businesses to political parties for government contracts and Di Pietro was seen as a graftbusting hero and won huge popularity.

Di Pietro was the target of an earlier probe by Brescia magistrates into allegations of corruption and of profiting from holding a public office. All charges against him were dropped in April shortly before he was named to the cabinet.
