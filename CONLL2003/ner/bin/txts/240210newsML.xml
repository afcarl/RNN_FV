<p>Anti-corruption magistrates dealt new blows to President Jacques Chirac's Gaullist RPR on Friday, placing the party's personnel chief and the Paris mayor's wife under investigation in separate sleaze probes.</p>
<p>In a third case, three ex-budget ministers -- Socialists Henri Emmanuelli and Michel Charasse, and the RPR's Nicolas Sarkozy -- were called before a Paris judge in a probe on alleged tax breaks linked to funding of political parties.</p>
<p>As probes into an alleged covert RPR funding scheme widened, justice sources said Louise-Yvonne Casetta, nicknamed &quot;la cassette&quot; (the cashbox) because she was regarded as RPR shadow treasurer, had been placed under investigation by Nanterre magistrate Patrick Desmure on suspicion of graft.</p>
<p>Casetta, who had been in custody since before dawn on Thursday, is suspected of misuse of corporate funds in connection with alleged illicit funding of the RPR by the construction firm Maillard et Duclos in 1992-93.</p>
<p>She was the RPR's head of personnel until last September and is widely believed to have been its main secret fundraiser.</p>
<p>Justice sources said she was questioned chiefly about links between RPR funding and public works contracts. She denied all wrongdoing, the sources said.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Jacques Toubon, a Chirac loyalist, told reporters he had &quot;strictly no comment to make on the case save that justice works better than people often say&quot;.</p>
<p>In a second probe targeting the RPR, judges in Evry outside Paris placed Xaviere Tiberi, wife of the RPR man who succeeded Chirac as mayor of the capital, under investigation for misuse of public funds, justice sources said.</p>
<p>Investigators suspect the wife of Mayor Jean Tiberi of being paid 200,000 francs ($40,000) for a 36-page report largely copied out of a book.</p>
<p>Xavier Dugoin, RPR president of the Essone regional authority outside Paris, was also investigation in the case, allegedly for paying the sum to Mrs Tiberi, the sources said.</p>
<p>Toubon has acknowledged ordering a helicopter chartered to track down a magistrate holidaying in Nepal in an effort to head off the probe of Mrs Tiberi, which was being pursued in the magistrate's absence by an independent-minded deputy.</p>
<p>In a separate case, the weekly Le Point reported that the three former budget ministers had been summoned by Paris Judge Laurence Vichinievsky about alleged tax breaks for the water utility Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE).</p>
<p>Le Point said the breaks may have been a counterpart to covert funding of political parties by CGE tied to public works contracts. CGE expressed surprise, saying it had never sought tax breaks and that it submitted to generally-applied rules.</p>
<p>Emanuelli's lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve said the two Socialists may refuse the judge's summons for early next week.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see why the judge did not also summon (Prime Minister) Alain Juppe who was budget minister in 1986-88,&quot; he said. Sarkozy could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The judge, who in October placed Communist leader Robert Hue and his predecessor Georges Marchais under investigation, is probing CGE's payment of nearly 13 million francs ($2.6 million) in 1992-94 linked to local water contracts in some 70 towns.</p>
<p>In southern France, public prosecutors gave an investigating magistrate the green light to widen his corruption probe into Cannes mayor Michel Mouillot and study funding for Mouillot's Republican Party, justice sources said.</p>
<p>Mouillot, suspected of receiving bribes from a Cannes casino, has alleged that the money was destined to the party, something its local branch denies.</p>
