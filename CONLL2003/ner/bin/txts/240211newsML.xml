<p>French authorities studied tighter security on Paris trains on Friday as investigators probed a mystery blast in the countryside last month that may have been a test for Tuesday's train bomb that killed three people.</p>
<p>An Algerian man carrying a false passport was detained in Calais, northern France, on Thursday when he tried to board a ferry for Britain.</p>
<p>But investigators concluded after questioning that he had no link to the train bombing, sources close to the probe said.</p>
<p>The man was to be questioned further in Paris, they added.</p>
<p>The blast claimed a third victim when a 25-year-old Moroccan student, Mohamed Benchaou, died of his injuries on Thursday night. President Jacques Chirac sent a message of condolence to the Moroccan prime minister and the man's family.</p>
<p>A second message was sent to the Canadian prime minister and the family of a second bombing victim, newly married Helene Viel of Quebec. The final fatality was Frenchman Lucien Devambez.</p>
<p>Twenty people were still in hospital on Friday out of a total of 94 treated for injuries.</p>
<p>The French Human Rights League called on authorities not to make France's three million Arabs scapegoats for the attack.</p>
<p>It asked that police refrain from systematically treating Arabs as suspects and singling them out in crowds for identity checks and body-searches.</p>
<p>The head of the Paris regional transport authority said he was studying extra security to seal the areas under seats in trains and buses to make it harder to conceal bombs.</p>
<p>Tuesday's bomb, concealed in a bulky 13-kg (27-pound) gas canister, was placed under a seat in a bag.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to work out whether it would be efficient. I have ordered a study,&quot; Jean-Paul Bailly told Radio Luxembourg, adding that it would involve redesigning 200,000 seats in underground trains and more than 300,000 in buses.</p>
<p>Wider use of surveillance cameras was also under study.</p>
<p>Investigators, expecting a long and painstaking probe, were looking into an explosion south of Paris on November 19 which they suspect was a test run for the bomb on the rush-hour train, gendarmerie sources said.</p>
<p>They confirmed a report in the daily Le Parisien that a gas canister bomb similar to the one used in Tuesday's attack had exploded in a workers' shed on waste ground in the Essonne region. No one was hurt.</p>
<p>Judicial sources said the explosion at Port Royal may really have been designed to go off at Saint Michel station two stops away and where an attack killed eight people last year.</p>
<p>False bomb alerts disrupted traffic on the Paris underground rail network, which has been under tight guard since the bombing of a train at the Port Royal station during Tuesday's rush-hour.</p>
<p>Traffic on two lines of the RER suburban express railway was thrown into disarray on Friday after suspect packages were found at Gare du Nord and Chatelet stations.</p>
<p>Both proved to be false alerts but tens of thousands of commuters were delayed or made to evacuate trains and stations. There were similar false alarms in Marseille, southern France.</p>
<p>Investigators said they suspected Algerian militants were behind Tuesday's attack because the bombing methods and target bore striking similarities to a series of 1995 attacks claimed by fundamentalist rebels from the former French colony.</p>
