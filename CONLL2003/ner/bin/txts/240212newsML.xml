<p>Four African states are ready to nominate candidates for the post of U.N. secretary-general on Friday now that Boutros Boutros-Ghali has temporarily put aside his bid for re-election.</p>
<p>The nominees, according to diplomats, are: Kofi Annan of Ghana, the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping; Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania, the former U.N. special envoy for Burundi; Amara Essy of the Ivory Coast, its foreign minister and the U.N. General Assembly president in 1994-95; and Hamid Algabid of Niger, the secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference.</p>
<p>Representatives of the U.N. missions of Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Mauritania and Niger have scheduled a meeting with Security Council president Paolo Fulci of Italy to hand in the nominations in writing, the envoys said.</p>
<p>It was not known if other candidates would step forward. Diplomats said General Joseph Garba of Nigeria, a  U.N. General Assembly president in 1989-90, was putting forth his own candidacy without being nominated by his country.</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday opened the door for other Africans to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race.</p>
<p>His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse. The United States on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 Security Council members supported him.</p>
<p>The move by the African states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week, a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee.</p>
<p>The Security Council has to vote on a new secretary-general and then seek the endorsement of the 185-members General Assembly before December 31 when Boutros-Ghali's term expires.</p>
