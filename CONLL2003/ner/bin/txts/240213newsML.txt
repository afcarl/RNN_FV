FOCUS - EU gene-maize policy under fire.

EU policy on gene-modified foods came under pressure on Friday as news emerged that shipments of U.S. gene-modified maize may already be in Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese ports in breach of EU rules, diplomats said.

"There may be non-authorised maize in Europe. We know that maize is arriving in EU ports and we are not at all excluding that there may be gene-modified maize in some," said one European Commission source, who asked not to be identified.

Ports in Spain, Portugual and the Netherlands were the most likely to have received deliveries, including a gene-modified corn strain made by Swiss chemicals company Ciba-Geigy AG and grown in the United States, the source added.

The European Commission is due to discuss and possibly decide on December 18 whether to allow imports of the modified maize, which Ciba Geigy has altered to make it resistant to the corn-borer pest and to increase its tolerance to certain weedkillers.

Until then it is illegal for the maize to be sold on EU markets although storing it is legal, the source said.

A Commission decision to clear the maize, which U.S. authorities have approved, will depend on advice from EU committees on food, animal feed and pesticides.

European Union environment ministers failed last June to agree on a French-backed proposal to approve the maize, with some citing fears about the environmental effects of releasing the new strain and others saying that a "marker gene" used in the Ciba maize could undermine the effectiveness of an antibiotic used in animals and humans.

EU officials preparing Monday's environment ministers meeting pressed the Commission on Friday to clarify its position, saying continued delay left European importers in the dark about what to do with maize shipments.

Commission environment spokesman Peter Jorgensen told a news conference that the EU's 15 member states were warned in writing on November 27 that it was their responsibility to stop such imports entering the bloc.

U.S. maize exports to the EU were worth $530 million in 1995/96 when world prices were very high. Exports are normally worth $300 million.

A second EU diplomat said that repeated delays in approving the maize had as much to do with politics as science, with neither EU governments nor the Commission wanting to be held responsible for the decision.

Europe's consumers and environmental groups have become increasingly uneasy about the safety of their food during 1996.

The year has seen a worldwide export ban on British beef and derived products because of the "mad cow" brain-wasting disease and an ongoing EU/U.S. row about the safety of growth-promoting hormones in U.S. beef.

Genetically modified U.S.-origin soybeans, sold by the U.S. chemicals company Monsanto and approved for release by authorities on both sides of the Atlantic, have also come under attack from European consumer groups, retailers and environmentalists who insist that foods containing the strain be clearly labelled.
