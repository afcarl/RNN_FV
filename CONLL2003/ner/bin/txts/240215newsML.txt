EU snubs Belgrade on better trade treatment.

European Union foreign ministers snubbed Yugoslavia on Friday, refusing to give it the preferential trade terms already granted to others in the Balkan region.

In a strongly worded statement, they expressed deep concern over developments in the country and condemned the "undemocratic annulment" of November 17 local election results and "arbitrary action" against independent media.

They called on all sides to refrain from violence.

Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, who chaired the meeting, said the EU had hoped to be able to extend the trade concessions at Friday's session.

"But the very worrying developments in Belgrade over the recent few weeks have completely ruled this out," he said.

Students and the opposition have been campaigning against Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in the streets of Belgrade since Zajedno, the opposition coalition, accused the ruling Socialists of robbing it of victory in the local elections. Serbia and Montenegro make up rump Yugoslavia.

Spring said it was a "great pity" that on the day the EU should have been starting to put its relations with rump Yugoslavia on a more constructive footing, there should be such deep concern in the bloc about the situation in Serbia.

"We continue to hope that that situation can be resolved," he said.

Carl Bildt, the international high representative in Bosnia, told a news conference: "In my opinion there will be no further deliberations on the question of preferential trade arrangements until the local elections issue has been sorted out."

At their last meeting on November 25, EU foreign ministers agreed in principle to grant Serbia and Montenegro preferential trade treatment but to delay implementation at least until Friday's meeting.

The annulment of the election results, Belgrade's perceived lack of assistance in pursuing alleged war criminals, and continued tension over the Serb-governed Kosovo region are among reasons why the ministers are reluctant to reward Belgrade with better trade terms.

German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel drew parallels with the situation in Eastern Europe before the Berlin Wall came down seven years ago.

"Somebody who undermines the will of the people will have a hard time finding the road to Europe," he told reporters.

However, Bildt noted "signs of light in the darkness yesterday", referring to a series of concessions by Belgrade authorities on Thursday.

For example, banned independent radios have been allowed to start broadcasting again and the supreme court has agreed to review the election results.

"The fact that they did not succeed in closing down the most important independent media in Belgrade is significant," said Bildt.

British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind took a similar line, telling reporters: "There are some signs that the Serbian authorities may realise that they've gone too far."

Bildt said Serbia faced a political and economic crisis which could have implications for the whole region. He believed the crisis would escalate if the supreme court did not make certain that the election results were respected. The EU would then have to look at its policy options, he said.

But he seemed to dismiss the idea of sanctions. "I think discussions on sanctions are somewhat out of place to put it mildly," he said, adding that they tended to strengthen the governments they were aimed at.
