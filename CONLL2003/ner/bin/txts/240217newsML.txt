Iran is making overtures to buy troubled east German machinery maker Sket Magdeburg GmbH and two other companies in the former communist region in an effort to improve ties with Bonn, government officials said on Friday.

Iranian Minister for Mines and Metals Mohammad Hossein Mahlouji and Saxony Anhalt's state economics minister Klaus Schucht have signed a letter of intent, officials at the Iranian embassy and the state government said.

Mahlouji visited the machinery plant for two hours on Thursday. Saxony Anhalt spokesman Hans Juergen Fink said Iran hoped to buy Sket as a whole or in parts, and would soon name Iranian enterprises that would participate in the deal.

Wolf Schoede, spokesman for the BvS privatisation agency, told German radio, "We hope the Iranian delegation quickly makes concrete its intentions...so we know what jobs, what investments and what future concept we are talking about,"

BvS will make a formal review of the Iranian plan when concrete proposals are presented, BvS, the successor to the Treuhand agency, said in a statement.

Germany, Iran's largest European trading partner, has come under fire from other leading nations for its close relations with Iran, which owes it $13 billion.

But Bonn's policy of dialogue has recently been strained by the Berlin trial of five men for the 1992 killing of three Kurdish dissidents and their translator in Berlin. Prosecutors allege Teheran ordered the killings.

The daily Frankfurter Allgemein Zeitung, in a report made available ahead of publication on Saturday, quoted Iran's ambassador to Germany, Sayed Hossein Mussawian, as saying his country was "fundametally interested" in buying Sket.

He told the paper Iranian automotive components maker Paynaehal signed a prelimiary agreement to purchase east German diesel motor manufacturer DMS of Magdeburg. Another Iranian company, Peykarih, plans to build a factory near Magdeburg for 135 million marks to make plastic fasteners.

"These three projects are a positive step towards strengthening German-Iranian relations," he said.

Mahlouji on Friday discussed Iran's interest in Sket in Bonn with Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, who said he would welcome Iran's investment, particularly in east Germany, a ministry statement said.

According to the paper, the Iranian delegation also met executives from German companies such as Thyssen, Mannesmann, KHD and Krupp to discuss potential joint projects.

Sket, which once employed 18,000 workers and was a main supplier to communist eastern Europe, has absorbed billions in state aid after posting heavy losses since German unification. Officials say it continues to lose half a million marks ($325,000) a day.

BvS approved earlier this week a restructuring plan that would split Sket into five companies and shrink the work force to 425 workers from 1,850. Investment bank West Merchant Bank has been named to manage the restructuring.

BvS said it would release over 200 million marks in restructuring funds only after the European Commission approves the restructuring plan.

The five companies set to continue Sket's work have already been founded and are due to start up on January 2, leaving only a narrow window of opportunity.

"Customers and suppliers need certainty. The name Sket must be clearly represented in the market," Schoede said.

In mid-October Sket filed for liquidation proceedings after its work force refused to support a drastic cost-cutting programme that would have cut the work force by two-thirds.
