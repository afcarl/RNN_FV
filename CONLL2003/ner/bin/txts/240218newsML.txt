Britain calms fears over new EU treaty draft.

Britain backed away from a potential confrontation with its European Union partners on Friday, saying a draft EU treaty containing many provisions it opposes was acceptable at this stage.

Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, whose Conservative Party is almost fighting a civil war over Europe, said the draft treaty was even-handed.

"It seems to present the positions in a fair and comprehensive way," he told reporters at an EU foreign ministers meeting. "It is a reasonable basis for further negotiations."

The draft, written by EU president Ireland, is to be discussed by EU leaders at a summit in Dublin on December 13 and 14.

Conservative Euro-sceptics, already in a furore over whether Britain should exercise its opt-out on the single currency, are expected to watch every move made at the summit by Prime Minister John Major for a sign of softening on Europe.

Rifkind said he was pleased that the draft contained no specific language on two issues that Britain vehemently opposes -- watering down a country's veto right and allowing others to integrate faster when a majority choses to do so.

Ireland specifically left out actual treaty language on such subjects to give countries like Britain what one negotiator called "an escape clause".

"There will be no attempt to reach a conclusion in Dublin, Rifkind said, underlining that the draft treaty was designed to be a report on the state of negotations due to end in June.

Others noted, however, that presidency texts at this stage of a treaty negotiation are usually fairly close to the end result.

The text contains a number of proposals that go directly to the heart of British Euro-sceptic objections to the EU, including a call for a joint asylum and immigration policy, and a treaty chapter making employment a legal goal of the bloc.

Rifkind reiterated that Britain would veto its participation in such moves.

He said Britain had managed to get a number of its own wishes included in the main text, including on having decisions taken at the lowest approriate level and on defence.

In other matters, Rifkind said, the report showed that London was not isolated.

"With the exception of (employment laws) where we have an opt-out, there is no area where the United Kingdom stands alone," he said.
