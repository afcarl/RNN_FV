<p>Britain backed away from a potential confrontation with its European Union partners on Friday, saying a draft EU treaty containing many provisions it opposes was acceptable at this stage.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, whose Conservative Party is almost fighting a civil war over Europe, said the draft treaty was even-handed.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to present the positions in a fair and comprehensive way,&quot; he told reporters at an EU foreign ministers meeting. &quot;It is a reasonable basis for further negotiations.&quot;</p>
<p>The draft, written by EU president Ireland, is to be discussed by EU leaders at a summit in Dublin on December 13 and 14.</p>
<p>Conservative Euro-sceptics, already in a furore over whether Britain should exercise its opt-out on the single currency, are expected to watch every move made at the summit by Prime Minister John Major for a sign of softening on Europe.</p>
<p>Rifkind said he was pleased that the draft contained no specific language on two issues that Britain vehemently opposes -- watering down a country's veto right and allowing others to integrate faster when a majority choses to do so.</p>
<p>Ireland specifically left out actual treaty language on such subjects to give countries like Britain what one negotiator called &quot;an escape clause&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no attempt to reach a conclusion in Dublin, Rifkind said, underlining that the draft treaty was designed to be a report on the state of negotations due to end in June.</p>
<p>Others noted, however, that presidency texts at this stage of a treaty negotiation are usually fairly close to the end result.</p>
<p>The text contains a number of proposals that go directly to the heart of British Euro-sceptic objections to the EU, including a call for a joint asylum and immigration policy, and a treaty chapter making employment a legal goal of the bloc.</p>
<p>Rifkind reiterated that Britain would veto its participation in such moves.</p>
<p>He said Britain had managed to get a number of its own wishes included in the main text, including on having decisions taken at the lowest approriate level and on defence.</p>
<p>In other matters, Rifkind said, the report showed that London was not isolated.</p>
<p>&quot;With the exception of (employment laws) where we have an opt-out, there is no area where the United Kingdom stands alone,&quot; he said.</p>
