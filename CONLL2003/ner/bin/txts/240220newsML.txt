Verification for biological weapons pact by 2001.

A major conference checking compliance with a treaty banning biological weapons ended on Friday without reflecting Western fears over Iraq in a final statement and allowed a 1998 verification target date to slip.

The international conference endorsed establishment of a verification regime "as soon as possible" by the year 2001 to check compliance with the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention.

Western nations failed to win support from non-aligned states for the 1998 timetable proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton and the European Union, according to diplomats.

"We didn't even come close," complained one Western envoy.

For the sake of reaching consensus, the United States and 22 other Western countries also backed down from their demand for the conference's final declaration to refer to Iraq.

But in a separate joint statement Western countries expressed deep concern over lingering questions about "illicit biological weapons activity" in Iraq, including questions about "dismantlement and destruction of that programme".

Experts from 80 of the 138 states which have ratified the convention banning lethal agents took part in the regular review conference, held every four years.

Sir Michael Weston, Britain's ambassador who chaired the two-week session, said there was "growing acceptance of the inevitability" of adding a verification protocol to the pact.

The final declaration urges an ad hoc group assessing the feasibility of verification measures since 1995 to intensify its work "with a view to completing it as soon as possible before the commencement of the fifth review conference" in 2001.

"The text is the result of consensus," Weston told a final news conference.

"A number of delegations said it should be completed by 1998. But there was resistance and that is why there is no deadline or target date in the final declaration."

Weston, referring to the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, which took two decades to negotiate and finally enters into force in April 1997, said: "I don't think that the fact that the commitment here is to do it before the next review conference -- within a five-year period -- is at all bad at all."

Non-aligned states, led by India and Pakistan, resist the idea of on-site inspections which they deem intrusive and a measure of last resort, according to diplomats. They also called for lifting current export controls, a move blocked by the West.

In a statement read out by Australia, the Western nations said they closely followed the work of UNSCOM, the United Nations Special Commission. Set up after the 1991 Gulf War, UNSCOM is charged with overseeing the scrapping of Iraq's chemical, biological and ballistic weapons programmes.

"We continue to be very concerned about the information uncovered by UNSCOM. We remain very concerned by the revelations of illicit biological weapons activity, including questions that remain unanswered about dismantlement and destruction of that programme," the group said.

"The Commission (UNSCOM) noted in its last report that this biological disarmament process was not yet completed," it added.

The West said Iraq had made clear that any reference to UNSCOM activity would mean no consensus on a final declaration.

Iraq's envoy to the Geneva conference took the floor at the talks to defend his country, according to Western diplomats.

Weston said the phrase on Iraq, deleted at the last moment, merely noted "the efforts of UNSCOM and looks forward to the early and satisfactory completion of UNSCOM's important work".

"The only country that appeared to have any difficulty with that was Iraq. The lineup on that particular reference was probably one to 79 (states)," Weston said.

During the talks, the United States said it suspected 12 countries -- including Russia, China and Iraq -- of having active biological weapons systems in various stages.

Delegates argued over what to say about two infractions -- discovery of Iraq's programme in 1991 and President Boris Yeltsin's admission in 1992 that Russia had inherited an offensive biological weapons programme from the Soviet Union.

The final declaration did not refer to Moscow either.
