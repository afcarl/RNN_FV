VW unswayed by renewed GM demands.

German carmaker Volkswagen AG on Friday rejected demands by rival General Motors Corp for it to further distance itself from a former top VW executive at the centre of industrial spying allegations.

The executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, quit his post as the production chief at the German carmaker but may still work for VW as a consultant. VW has also pledged to honour his contract until March 1998 and pay him four million marks ($2.61 million).

GM officials have also been irritated that VW's successor to Lopez, Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, 39, is also a former GM official who followed Lopez to VW in March 1993 and is a defendant in a U.S. racketeering lawsuit filed by GM.

VW said adamantly it had not acted illegally and sources at the carmaker said the firm would not cave into GM's demands, which stem from the U.S. companies allegations that Lopez took secret documents when he moved VW.

The sources said VW would wait for a decision on whether formal charges would be filed against Lopez on the allegations.

"There is a cultural difference in that GM thinks it can put political pressure on Volkswagen and expect that we will cave in," a VW official said.

Shares in VW, which have recently been under stiff selling pressure amid concerns that it potentially faces a heavy payout in the U.S. lawsuit, fell about three percent in bourse trade to end at 584.50 marks, less than a dramatic four percent drop in Germany's 30-share DAX index.

But the impact of the legal battle on VW was evident in a survey by the Forsa Institute which showed 43 percent of Germans were convinced VW's image had suffered as a result of the GM accusations.

The survey of 1,000 Germans on December 4-5 also showed that 35 percent feared VW's sales would fall and one-third expected VW, one of Germany's largest employers with about 100,000 workers in Germany, to lose jobs as a result.

But the survey also showed one in five Germans did not believe the legal fight would have an impact on the carmaker.

GM and its German arm, Adam Opel AG, said on Friday that VW needed to take "fundamental steps" if any deal were to be reached in a U.S. civil court lawsuit GM brought against Lopez and VW leaders on racketeering charges that uses laws initially designed to fight the mafia.

The U.S. auto giant also reaffirmed that VW must also publically acknowledge that Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, had acted wrongly in taking the documents and that the VW must sever relations with him and seven other former GM employees who followed him to the Wolfsburg-based carmaker.

Lopez's lawyer has said he expects criminal charges to be filed against his client by the end of the year. Prosecutor officials say a decision on any charges is expected next week.

GM also criticised the request of an attorney representing Lopez in the U.S. for seeking a stay in GM's civil lawsuit.

"GM and Opel continue to seek a judicial determination of the truth as expeditiously as possible in the VW/Lopez case, and believe that the appropriate forum to argue the facts and evidence is in courts of law," GM said in a statement.

VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said VW officials who are named as defendants in the lawsuit, including VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech and VW management board member Jens Neumann, would agree to testify in any court hearings.

"There have been reports in Detroit newspapers that all Volkswagen officials would plead the Fifth Amendment and agree to take their right not to incriminate themselves," Kocks said.

"I cannot speak for Mr. Lopez, but as far as Volkswagen is concerned, all top executives who are involved will go to court, including in Detroit," Kocks said.
