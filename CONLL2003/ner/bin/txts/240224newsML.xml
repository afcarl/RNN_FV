<headline>German shares pare losses as Dow bounces off low.</headline>

<p>German shares pared some of their heaviest losses in the last five years in post-bourse electronic dealings on Friday as dealers said the fall had actually been healthy and could power further gains.</p>
<p>The computerised IBIS DAX ended down 61.90 points, or 2.14 percent, at 2,832.53, after recouping over 70 points when U.S. unemployment data released in afternoon European dealings reassured markets the U.S. economy was not overheating.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones index, which had been expected to match losses in Europe and Asia, rebounded from the day's low and recouped more than 80 points from early lows, boding well for a German share market recovery next week, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are swinging between fear and hope and at the moment the Dow is giving us cause for hope,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The DAX index of top shares had earlier dived to end bourse trade down 4.05 percent, or 117.95 points, at 2,791.96 points, the biggest loss since a nine percent tumble on the 1991 coup against former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p>The fall wiped out two weeks of gains on the DAX in one fell swoop and came after overnight comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, hinting at concerns over the recent steep gains in the U.S. financial market.</p>
<p>Greenspan said the Federal Reserve had to be wary of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; affecting financial markets.</p>
<p>But despite the speed of the fall, some analysts and players said the market had long been due for a correction and said the upward trend in Germany was still intact.</p>
<p>&quot;We had risen too fast and overheated, and some profit-taking and consolidation can only be healthy for the market,&quot; said Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>&quot;In Europe and particularly in Germany we have a completely different scenario. We still have no inflation danger and in terms of economic recovery we are two years behins the U.S,&quot; Grebe said.</p>
<p>The market was not only discouraged by Greenspan's comments, but also by a fall in the dollar to around 1.53 marks and comments by a Bundesbank council member.</p>
<p>Reimut Jochimsen said on Friday that he saw no need for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth, dampening hopes for any further German interest rate cuts and sending German bond downwards.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Jochimsen said the German economy was not on solid base for sustained growth.</p>
<p>The dollar's strength earlier this week to 23-month highs above 1.57 marks, had boosted the German DAX to all-time record highs above 2,900 points, but on Friday the dollar slipped pushing exporting stocks down in particular.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest gainers of the past few days are now the biggest losers because of the dollar's fall,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Shares in chemical firm Bayer AG was the biggest DAX loser, ending down nearly seven percent at 60.50 marks, while BASF AG dropped 6.35 percent to 57.55 marks.</p>
<p>But one trader said, &quot;If you had bought chemical sector stocks three weeks ago, you made very nice profits today.&quot;</p>
