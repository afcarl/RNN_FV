<headline>France says welcomes Clinton's choice of Albright.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>France on Friday welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's nomination of Madeleine Albright as new secretary of state and brushed off reports that ties were badly frayed between Paris and Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;I am delighted to be able to collaborate with you in strengthening Franco-American cooperation and friendship,&quot; Foreign Minister Herve de Charette wrote to Albright in a letter released by the ministry.</p>
<p>&quot;The difficult problems which we must deal with as we approach the end of the century demand more than ever that we rely on our two nations' shared values, principles and goals, whatever the differences between us,&quot; he said, praising Albright for her in-depth knowledge of European and international relations &quot;as well as your generosity and human qualities&quot;.</p>
<p>A senior French official dismissed the notion that Paris might be bitter toward Albright because of her role in battling for the replacement of Boutros Boutros-Ghali as U.N. secretary general, whom France has backed for reappointment.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome her appointment as a very positive development,&quot; said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The French investigative and satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine reported this week that top French officials considered Franco-American relations in an &quot;appalling&quot; state but that President Jacques Chirac had ordered all government officials to speak only in positive terms of ties with Washington.</p>
<p>The senior official, asked if he had seen the article, responded that he had and repeated: &quot;We welcome her appointment as a very positive development&quot;.</p>
<p>Paris and Washington have locked horns in recent weeks over the need for a multinational force to aid refugees in eastern Zaire, whether a European should be given a key NATO regional command, the proper role for France in Middle East peace negotiations and whether there should be an African crisis force.</p>
<p>When Clinton announced his decision, he slipped and said Albright was sent to the United Nations because &quot;I thought she would make a good secretary-general.&quot;</p>
<p>Responding to laughter, he said to her &quot;You don't want that job.&quot; This prompted Vice President Al Gore to quip &quot;though she does speak French&quot; -- a dig at Paris's insistence than any successor to Boutros-Ghali should speak good French.</p>
