(Corrects to delete reference to CDR holding as a stakeholder and inserts reference to CDC. Thomson said CDR does not have a stake.)

French state-controlled electronics company Thomson SA said in a statement that its shareholders meeting had approved a planned increase in the share capital of 11 billion francs -- essentially a state cash injection to the indebted group.

The shareholders are representatives for the state, France Telecom and a pool of banks represented by the state-owned Caisse des Depots et de Consignations (CDC).

It said the subscription period for the rise, initially set at December 31, had been extended to April 30, 1997.

A company source said that the meeting had not decided a split of the capital increase over 100-percent owned consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM) and 58-percent owned Thomson-CSF.

At end-1995, Thomson SA had debts of 25.3 billion francs of which 13.8 billion were at TMM and 2.3 billion at Thomson-CSF.
