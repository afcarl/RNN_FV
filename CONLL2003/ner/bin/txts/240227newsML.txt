Swiss shares end down two percent but off lows.

1530 GMT - Swiss shares ended two percent lower in nervous trade but well above the day's lows just above 3,800 points in the blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI).

An early slump on Wall Street weighed on the shares but did not endanger the slight recovery after midday. Dealers were split on whether the current level would be considered a buy opportunity. "This depends on Wall Street", one trader noted.

Bourses around the world were pressured on Friday after U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's remarks about "irrational exuberance" on financial markets.

* SMI down 78.3 points, or 2.0 percent, at 3,835.5.  

* Most-active Roche certificates slid 250 francs, or 2.46 percent, to 9,910. Ciba and Sandoz also lost more than two percent.

* Surveillance held comparatively well, sliding 0.8 percent to 3,120 francs.

* ABB, Nestle and the banks lost between one and two percent.

* Insurers Winterthur, Zurich and Balois as well as SMH were down between three and 3.5 percent.  

* On the Swiss Options and Futures Exchange (Soffex), trade was heavy in SMI options and futures.

Volume in SMI options reached 65,574 contracts, which was more than 43 percent of the total options contract volume of 152,101. 11,929 SMI futures were traded.
