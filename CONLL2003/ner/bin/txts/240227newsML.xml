<headline>Swiss shares end down two percent but off lows.</headline>
<text>
<p>1530 GMT - Swiss shares ended two percent lower in nervous trade but well above the day's lows just above 3,800 points in the blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI).</p>
<p>An early slump on Wall Street weighed on the shares but did not endanger the slight recovery after midday. Dealers were split on whether the current level would be considered a buy opportunity. &quot;This depends on Wall Street&quot;, one trader noted.</p>
<p>Bourses around the world were pressured on Friday after U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's remarks about &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; on financial markets.</p>
<p>* SMI down 78.3 points, or 2.0 percent, at 3,835.5.  </p>
<p>* Most-active Roche certificates slid 250 francs, or 2.46 percent, to 9,910. Ciba and Sandoz also lost more than two percent.</p>
<p>* Surveillance held comparatively well, sliding 0.8 percent to 3,120 francs.</p>
<p>* ABB, Nestle and the banks lost between one and two percent.</p>
<p>* Insurers Winterthur, Zurich and Balois as well as SMH were down between three and 3.5 percent.  </p>
<p>* On the Swiss Options and Futures Exchange (Soffex), trade was heavy in SMI options and futures.</p>
<p>Volume in SMI options reached 65,574 contracts, which was more than 43 percent of the total options contract volume of 152,101. 11,929 SMI futures were traded.</p>
