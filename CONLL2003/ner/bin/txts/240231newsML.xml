<p>Italy's aviation regulatory body RAI said on Friday that it had given the all clear to private carrier Alpi Eagles which it grounded two days ago for safety checks.</p>
<p>RAI said in a statement that it was satisfied with air and ground controls on two of the company's four aircraft and, as far as it was concerned, passenger services could resume with those aircraft.</p>
<p>Checks on the other two aircraft would be carried out on Saturday and Sunday, it said.</p>
<p>RAI said Alpi Eagles had also adopted &quot;radical and immediate&quot; measures, including sacking the head of its technical staff and replacing him and other senior officials.</p>
<p>It also presented a plan to tighten safety standards.</p>
<p>Alpi Eagles started business in June and is owned by a group of northeast Italian investors, among them white goods producer Zanussi -- owned by Sweden's Electrolux -- clothes producer Stefanel and the Marzotto textiles group.</p>
