Sleaze probe targets French Gaullist fundraiser.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Louise-Yvonne Casetta, personnel director for French President Jacques Chirac's Gaullist RPR party, has been formally placed under investigation on suspicion of political corruption, justice sources said on Friday.

Casetta, nicknamed "la cassette" (the cashbox) because she was regarded as RPR shadow treasurer, is suspected of misuse of corporate funds in connection with alleged illicit funding of the RPR by the construction firm Maillard et Duclos in 1992-93.  

After being placed under investigation, Casetta was ordered freed by judge Patrick Desmure of the Paris suburb of Nanterre, the sources said. She had been in custody since early Thursday.

The judge prohibited her from leaving France or contacting other parties in the probe.

Casetta was head of personnel at party headquarters until last September but is widely regarded as having been its main secret fundraiser.

Justice sources said she had been questioned chiefly about links between RPR funding and public works contracts.
