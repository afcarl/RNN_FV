<p>The Security Council called on Iraq on Friday to cooperate with chief U.N. weapons inspector Rolf Ekeus, who is due in Baghdad on Sunday to demand the removal of destroyed missile engines for analysis abroad.</p>
<p>Iraq says it scrapped and buried without U.N. supervision a large number of SCUD missiles shortly after the end of the 1991 Gulf war.</p>
<p>But last month it prevented U.N. inspectors who unearthed them from sending engines and other parts to a laboratory in the United States to try to obtain a definitive accounting of the rockets involved.</p>
<p>Ekeus, who heads the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, has said between six and 16 missiles are unaccounted for.</p>
<p>While UNSCOM knows how many SCUDs Iraq obtained from the then-Soviet Union and roughly how many were used in the Gulf war and during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, it later discovered Iraq had been capable of producing missiles of its own.</p>
<p>In a letter to Iraqi deputy Prime Tareq Aziz last month, Ekeus said preventing the removal of the missile engines was a breach of a key Security Council resolution and &quot;a new departure of the most serious character.&quot;</p>
<p>After briefing the council Friday on his forthcoming trip, he told reporters it was regular practice for UNSCOM to send Iraqi weapons abroad for examination.</p>
<p>&quot;The question should be put to Iraq: why did they suddenly break an established practice?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Council President Francesco Paolo Fulci of Italy said members &quot;expressed the hope the current problem can quickly be overcome.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They also appealed to Iraq to cooperate fully with the Special Commission in the light of the need to promote a better atmosphere,&quot; he said. The council was looking forward to a report from Ekeus on his return.</p>
<p>His latest trip, one of a series of two-monthly visits to Baghdad, coincides with the imminent implementation of an agreement concluded last May to enable Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil, on a renewable basis, to buy food, medicines and other humanitarian supplies to help offset the effects of sanctions in place since its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>Deputy American U.N. ambassador Edward Gnehm said after the briefing that while the United States fully supported the &quot;oil-for-food&quot; deal which &quot;we are virtually on the threshhold of implementing,&quot; sanctions &quot;are not going to be lifted any time soon.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;oil-for-food&quot; arrangement was &quot;not a change in the sanctions regime or in any way an initial step in removing sanctions on Iraq,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is my government's view, and I think that of most council members, those sanctions are not going to be lifted any time soon with the kind of behaviour we are seeing Iraq display today,&quot; Gnehm added.</p>
<p>He said the sanctions, which include a ban on regular oil exports, depended on compliance with a key 1991 council resolution calling for the destruction of Iraq's weapons and other measures, such as providing information on missing Kuwaitis and returning Kuwaiti military equipment and other seized property.</p>
<p>Ekeus returned only last weekend from a visit to Gulf states -- but not to Iraq -- to seek voluntary contributions for UNSCOM, whose operating funds are nearly exhausted.</p>
<p>If the &quot;oil-for-food&quot; deal finally gets under way, UNSCOM should receive $15 million out of every $2 billion of oil sold by Iraq. A much larger sum will go for Gulf war reparations and to meet other war-related costs, leaving just over $1.3 billion to buy food and medicine for Iraqi civilians.</p>
