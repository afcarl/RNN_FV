Four Africans expected to enter U.N. race.

UNITED NATIONS 1996-12-06

Four African states are expected to nominate candidates for the post of U.N. secretary-general later on Friday now that Boutros Boutros-Ghali has temporarily put aside his bid for re-election, diplomats said.

The expected nominees are Kofi Annan of Ghana, the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping; Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania, the former U.N. special envoy for Burundi; Amara Essy of the Ivory Coast, its foreign minister and a former U.N. General Assembly president; and Hamid Algabid of Niger, secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference.  

The envoys said that representatives of the U.N. missions of Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Mauritania and Niger had scheduled a meeting with Security Council president Paolo Fulci of Italy to hand in the nominations in writing.

Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday opened the door for other candidates to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race.

The United States on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 Security Council members supported him.

The move by the African states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week, a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee. Boutros-Ghali's term expires on Dec. 31.
