<p>Four African states are expected to nominate candidates for the post of U.N. secretary-general later on Friday now that Boutros Boutros-Ghali has temporarily put aside his bid for re-election, diplomats said.</p>
<p>The expected nominees are Kofi Annan of Ghana, the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping; Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania, the former U.N. special envoy for Burundi; Amara Essy of the Ivory Coast, its foreign minister and a former U.N. General Assembly president; and Hamid Algabid of Niger, secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference.  </p>
<p>The envoys said that representatives of the U.N. missions of Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Mauritania and Niger had scheduled a meeting with Security Council president Paolo Fulci of Italy to hand in the nominations in writing.</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday opened the door for other candidates to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race.</p>
<p>The United States on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 Security Council members supported him.</p>
<p>The move by the African states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week, a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee. Boutros-Ghali's term expires on Dec. 31.</p>
