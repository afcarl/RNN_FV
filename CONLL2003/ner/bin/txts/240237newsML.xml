<headline>Mussolini's granddaughter rejoins far-right party.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Alessandra Mussolini, the granddaughter of Italy's Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, said on Friday she had rejoined the far-right National Alliance (AN) party she quit over policy differences last month.</p>
<p>&quot;I've gone back,&quot; she told a radio show shortly after AN leader Gianfranco Fini, who was being interviewed on the programme, said the row had been resolved.</p>
<p>&quot;He didn't want to lose me and I didn't want to lose him.&quot;</p>
<p>Fini told state radio RAI he met Mussolini thanks to the good offices of Giuseppe Tatarella, AN's leader in the Chamber of Deputies (lower house), and had overcome their differences.</p>
<p>Mussolini, 33, resigned from the parliamentary party group for what she said were strictly political reasons. The fiery politician, who is also a niece of screen star Sophia Loren, had accused AN leaders of stifling internal party debate.</p>
<p>Mussolini, who sits in the Chamber, told La Stampa newspaper last month after quitting AN's parliamentary party that she was considering joining the neo-fascist Social Movement (MS-Fiamma) formed by some of the Duce's World War Two followers.</p>
