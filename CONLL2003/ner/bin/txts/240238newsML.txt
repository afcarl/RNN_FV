Elf workers end nine-day strike on bitter note.

Oil workers called off a nine-day strike at Elf Aquitaine refineries in France on Friday after accepting more pay and earlier retirement but admitting defeat in a battle to save more than 300 jobs.

Strikers at Elf's Grandpuits refinery near Paris voted to accept a pay increase of 1.5 percent after tiring of a strike which crippled the oil giant in its backyard but failing to get the firm to climb down on planned job cuts.

Their vote triggered the collapse of strikes at two other plants where workers had only moments before voted to keep up the protest against France's biggest oil company.

"We can't go on by ourselves," said a union official at the Feyzin refinery near Lyon, where workers voted by 91 percent to stay on strike before hearing the action was already crumbling.

Workers at the traditionally hard-line plant would stay out for a few days for strike pay and then go back, she said.

An Elf spokesman said Grandpuits and the country's largest refinery at Donges, western France, would start up immediately.

The end of the strike shook already weaker oil prices in London and New York. Up until Thursday they had been driven up by the loss of a quarter of French production at Elf plants.

The breakdown also contrasted with the victorious parade home of striking French truckers just a week before.

The oil strike was partly inspired by concessions to the truckers, who gained a cut in the retirement age to 55 from 60 for drivers with 25 years' experience during a 12-day protest.

Union officials said Elf had lowered the retirement age to 56 or 57 for some shift workers and raised pay by 1.5 percent.

But the workers were bitter about appearing to have been bought off with money and perks when the strike had initially been called over plans to shed 330 Elf refining jobs in France.

"We don't give a damn about salaries. That was not why we have had nine days of strike," one union official said.

Elf refused to negotiate the job cuts, saying its plans had been forced on it by overcapacity in European refineries and a war for petrol sales with powerful French supermarkets.

Oil traders estimated the strike had blown a hole worth several million dollars a day in Elf's refinery earnings.

It also forced it to buy thousands of tonnes of oil products on the international market from its rivals in order to keep its petrol stations and depots full, oil traders said.

The cost -- at least $20 million by some estimates -- may have been reduced by selling part of the crude oil Elf cannot refine to other oil firms who are running at full capacity.

Unions hope the end of the latest French strike will not mark the end of their protests against oil firms, which they accuse of trying to get rid of at least 1,500 French jobs.

Five unions have called a nationwide oil strike for next Tuesday. But the breakdown of the Elf strike makes it uncertain how many workers will take part, officials from both sides said.

If only for technical reasons it would be difficult to shut down the three major Elf plants so soon after starting them up again, a union official at the company said.
