<p>Trade unions campaigning against a plan to wind down property loans group Credit Foncier de France said union representatives met an advisor of President Jacques Chirac on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;He denied that the Elysee (president's office) had taken a definitive stance (on the case),&quot; a joint union statement said.  </p>
<p>They said the advisor had assured union representatives that further meetings would be more than courtesy visits. But the advisor also said the plan announced last July by Finance Minister Jean Arthuis was in the name of the government and that the viability of the company had yet to be proven.</p>
<p>The unions called earlier on Friday for Arthuis to resign, alleging a conflict of interest on the Credit Foncier case.</p>
<p>The six unions alleged there was a conflict between his role as minister and as a partner in a private accounting firm that had audited the accounts of Credit Foncier subsidiaries in the past.  </p>
<p>&quot;For these reasons, we are seeking the immediate resignation of Jean Arthuis, who cannot play both sides of the fence in the Credit Foncier case,&quot; the unions said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>The private accounting firm in question, called Jean Arthuis et Associes, issued a statement on Friday evening saying it was surprised at the union statement.</p>
<p>The minister had not practised as a auditor or accountant since March 1986, the statement from the firm said.</p>
<p>The company had been involved in the auditing of the Credit Foncier subsidiary -- the Compagnie Fonciere de Construction -- from 1981 to 1995, but Arthuis had nothing more to do with the issue, it added.</p>
<p>&quot;Arthuis has not put a foot in the door since 1986,&quot; Denis Jacques, partner at the firm told Reuters. He said the minister was now no more than a shareholder with a small shareholding in the firm.</p>
