EU Commission plans to extend energy taxes.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

The European Commission is discussing plans to set minimum rates of excise duty for the first time on natural gas, coal and electricity and increase the rates for products such as petrol, diesel and heating fuel.

The Commission's plan, which could be submitted for approval to EU finance ministers in January, follows its failure to agree a so-called "carbon tax" aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emission levels in Europe.

Instead, EU leaders agreed the Commission should build on existing legislation by widening its scope to other energy products.

According to a draft directive currently being discussed by Commission officials, jet fuel would be exempt "for as long as such products are obliged to be exempted under international obligations" but the minimum duty on petrol would rise to 450 European currency units (Ecus) per 1,000 litres from January 1 from a current minimum of 337 Ecus.

A Commission official said the proposals were unlikely to have much impact on prices because the actual rates levied by most national governments currently exceed the EU-imposed minimums.

But energy-intensive industries such as the automobile and chemicals sectors expressed their concern that the plan would further dent Europe's competitiveness on the world market.

Claude Culem, head of economics and statistics at the European Chemical Industry Council said:

"We want to oppose this plan. The average energy price for the chemical industry in Europe is already a third higher than in the United States."

Others echoed his view.

"This is not compatible with the prime goal of competitiveness, unless energy sources for industrial use are exempted or, at the very least, that tax rates are aligned to the lowest levels charged by our competitors outside Europe," the European Lime Association (EULA) said in a statement.

EULA says it speaks on behalf of eight associations including the International Federation of Industrial Energy Consumers, the European Chemical Industry Council and the European Car Manufacturers Association.

At the beginning of 1995, the excise rate for leaded petrol was 562 Ecus in Germany, 585 Ecus in France, 527 Ecus in Italy and 462 Ecus in Britain, the Commission said last year in a report on excise duties on mineral oils, tobacco and alcohol.

On diesel oil used as motor fuel, the Commission proposes an increase in the minimum rate to 343 Ecus per 1,000 litres from a current 245 Ecus.

Current diesel rates in Germany, France and Italy are above 300 Ecus. In Britain they stand at 400 Ecus.

Electricity, which is not included in current EU legislation, would be taxed at one Ecu per megawatt/hour in 1998, a level which would double in the year 2000.
