<p>Algeria aims to double non-energy exports to $700 million within two years and reach a minimum of $2 billion a year from 2000, Finance Minister Abdelkrim Harchaoui said in an interview to be published on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The objective is to reach in the space of two years the $700 million. From around the year 2000 we are counting on a minimum of $2 billion..,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Extracts from the interview, which is to appear in the Mediterranean Development review, were carried by the official Algerian news agency APS on Friday.</p>
<p>OPEC member Algeria relies on oil and gas sales for nearly 95 percent of its foreign income, and much of its other state- owned industry operates at less than 50 percent capacity.</p>
<p>It has budgeted for $11.1 billion income from hydrocarbon exports next year.</p>
<p>Algeria's non-energy industrial output in the first six months of this year fell seven percent, earning just $366 million in exports, against the same period last year.</p>
<p>Harchaoui also said Algeria was making efforts to replace imports, particularly food, by locally-produced products.</p>
<p>&quot;All this effort aims at reducing the food bill and improving the financial capacity of Algeria,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The North African country is the world's biggest importer of hard wheat and has a food import bill averaging $2.5 billion a year.</p>
<p>In another interview in the same review, Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said Algeria was starting again to attract foreign interest.</p>
<p>The APS report did not mention the cause for the break in interest -- a five-year-old conflict between the authorities and Moslem fundamentalists in which about 60,000 people have died.</p>
<p>It quoted Ouyahia as saying: &quot;The investors are starting to return. The Germans and the Spanish have come...sometimes the contract between operators had stopped for three years. (Now) through visits of three days, some contracts have been concluded.&quot;</p>
<p>Industry Minister Abdessalam Bouchouareb told the same review that privatisation had accelerated in the past six months.</p>
<p>A new law on privatisation would soon go for debate before the National Transitional Council to enable Algeria to go &quot;further and more quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We need to put in place other means to attract foreign investors. At present we are examining the possibility of turning to popular privatisation,&quot; he said. The APS extract gave no other details on what he meant by this.</p>
