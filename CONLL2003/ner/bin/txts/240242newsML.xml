<text>
<p>Monday's Environment Council faces a heavy agenda including discussions on climate policy, leg-hold traps, gene-modified micro-organisms and the future broadening of EU policy into wider fields.</p>
<p>Discussions on climate change concern what position the EU is to take in climate negotiations with regard to carbon dioxide emissions for the years 2005, 2010 and 2020.</p>
<p>Draft council conclusions back the use of a binding protocol to take discussions beyond the positions agreed at the Berlin meeting in March 1995.</p>
<p>Conclusions speak of reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases of between five and 10 percent in relation to 1990 levels by 2005 and by 10 to 20 percent in 2010.</p>
<p>Member states must also decide whether to tie the objectives to 1990 emission levels or to maximum emission-per-head figures and decide how the effort should be shared out between member states.</p>
<p>&quot;As in the past, the reduction targets and the efforts to be made by the member states will be difficult to agree and there could be a lengthy discussion,&quot; one EU official said on Friday.</p>
<p>Ministers will then discuss the European Commission's review of the Fifth Environmental Action Programme, COM(95)647, and will quite probably adopt a common position, diplomats said.</p>
<p>The proposal for a joint decision under Article 130s(3), co-decision with the Council acting under qualified majority, will bring ministerial attention to bear on how to extend environment policy into agriculture and transport policies in particular.</p>
<p>&quot;The Scandinavians, Austrians, Germans and Dutch want more specific language in the text. They are unlikely to succeed,&quot; one EU diplomat told reporters on Friday, adding that these countries were likely to accept some sort of statement in the minutes.</p>
<p>Another issue will be agriculture, where Britain, possibly along with Austria, wants stronger language on integrating policies.</p>
<p>The proposal has attracted the anger of European Parliamentarians, some of whom described it as ineffectual and unambitious when they debated it in Strasbourg last month.</p>
<p>Environment Euro-MPs said that with the EU likely to miss many of its 2000 targets for environmental improvement, more should be done.</p>
<p>The next agenda item, on standards for leg-hold traps, will involve a European Commission report on the recent negotiations with Canada, Russia and the United States on how to prevent the implementation of the delayed EU import ban on fur from 13 species as set out in Council Regulation 3254/91.</p>
<p>Various diplomats said that while Canada and Russia appeared largely satisfied with the latest compromise texts, Washington remained unhappy with the proposed outright ban on steel-jawed traps and questions related to U.S. federal versus state legal powers.</p>
<p>In the absence of agreement, the EU says it would impose a ban on fur from animals caught in countries where leg-hold traps were permitted. If all parties agreed, so-called humane trapping standards would come into force according to the draft deal.</p>
<p>The deal would ban the use of conventional steel-jaw leg-hold traps within four years while allowing the use of approved padded-jaw and aquatic traps.</p>
<p>The Council will then tackle the proposal for amending Directive 90/219 on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms (GMMs), which was presented in March 1996 under article 130s(1), meaning it proceeds under the cooperation procedure and requires a Council qualified majority for adoption.</p>
<p>The proposal aims to remove the existing distinction between academic research into GMMs and industrial research. Ministers can rach no more than a political understanding on Monday, lacking as they do the European Parliament's opinion.</p>
<p>The text should be &quot;broadly acceptable to most delegations&quot;, EU officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>Next up on the agenda is the draft Council resolution on the Commission proposal COM(96)399 to modify the EU's waste management strategy.</p>
<p>The main issues are the waste hierarchy -- re-use, recycle, dispose -- with the ministers' attention being on the definition of recycling as it refers to incineration with or without energy recovery versus material recycling.</p>
<p>Council will also have to tackle the idea of waste being a good or an environmental issue for the EU, a point which pitches the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland against Germany. The former face significant imports of German waste destined for their furnaces while the latter has a problem with its hi-tech but expensive incinerators being under-used.</p>
<p>The Council is also set to discuss and adopt conclusions on next year's United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS), a follow-up to the Rio conference of 1992.</p>
<p>Ministers will then hear reports from the Irish presidency on what has happened under their tenure with the Auto/Oil proposals, COM(96)248, and with the draft drinking water directive COM(94)612.</p>
<p>Two other waste items up for discussion concern a spin-off proposal to Regulation 259/93 on control procedures for waste exports of non-hazardous wastes destined for non-OECD countries and final adoption of the proposed amendments to the 1993 regulation itself.</p>
<p>Ministers are also due to hear a report on the Commission proposal for promoting non-governmental organizations working on environment issues although they will not discuss it, officials said.</p>
<p>Finally, a long list of any-other-business items includes points on gene-modified maize, statements by Luxembourg and Austria on gene-modified soybeans, a Commission review of efforts related to the recent accession countries' environmental derogations, a presidency report on the third conference of the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, a report on the eighth Montreal Protocol meeting, a British report on efforts to cut ground-level ozone and to combat environment crimes and a Swedish delegation report on Agenda 21 measures for the Baltic Sea region.</p>
