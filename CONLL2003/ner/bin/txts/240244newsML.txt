Portuguese bond report.

LISBON 1996-12-06

Bonds closed off their lows as international markets, and particularly Italy, staged a late rally.

Traders see the benchmark 10-year cash bond continuing to track the bund at a distance of around 125 basis points.

"We ended up back at the 125 basis points (against the bund) and this is level at which we are likely to stay," said one trader. "On Monday, Spain is going to tumble, given that it was closed today, but we are going to stay with our eyes fixed on the bund," he added.
