Danish shares seen recovering from falls.

COPENHAGEN 1996-12-06

Lower than expected U.S. payroll figures took some of the sting out of Danish share losses on Friday and dealers saw the Copenhagen market in basically good shape for a recovery next week.

"It's good that it's the weekend now, that will put a bit of a damper on things," a dealer said.

Global market falls and profit-taking after the past two days' local highs sent the Copenhagen index from 131.74 to a low of 128.06 before prices turned up again during the afternoon.

The KFX top-20 index closed 2.38 point down at 129.36, in overall bourse turnover of 912 million crowns.

The KFX December future fell 2.40 point, to 129.20, with 635 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.

The dealer said it it was difficult to predict which shares might be at the forefront of the expected consolidation.

"The falls were evenly distributed, so its hard to say which paper will benefit most from an upturn, perhaps Sophus Berendsen through gains in (British unit) Rentokil," he said.

Berendsen closed 17 crowns down on Friday, at 736.20.

Tele Danmark, falling three crowns to 295, was the day's most traded paper, with 830,000 shares changing hands.
