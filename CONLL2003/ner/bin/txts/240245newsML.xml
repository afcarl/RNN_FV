<title>DENMARK: Danish shares seen recovering from falls.</title>
<headline>Danish shares seen recovering from falls.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Lower than expected U.S. payroll figures took some of the sting out of Danish share losses on Friday and dealers saw the Copenhagen market in basically good shape for a recovery next week.</p>
<p>&quot;It's good that it's the weekend now, that will put a bit of a damper on things,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Global market falls and profit-taking after the past two days' local highs sent the Copenhagen index from 131.74 to a low of 128.06 before prices turned up again during the afternoon.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index closed 2.38 point down at 129.36, in overall bourse turnover of 912 million crowns.</p>
<p>The KFX December future fell 2.40 point, to 129.20, with 635 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.</p>
<p>The dealer said it it was difficult to predict which shares might be at the forefront of the expected consolidation.</p>
<p>&quot;The falls were evenly distributed, so its hard to say which paper will benefit most from an upturn, perhaps Sophus Berendsen through gains in (British unit) Rentokil,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Berendsen closed 17 crowns down on Friday, at 736.20.</p>
<p>Tele Danmark, falling three crowns to 295, was the day's most traded paper, with 830,000 shares changing hands.</p>
