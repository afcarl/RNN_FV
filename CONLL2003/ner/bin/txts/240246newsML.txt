German union boss urges acceptance of pay deal.

BONN 1996-12-06

The head of Germany's largest trade union, IG Metall, urged regional union branches to waste no time in adopting a pay deal reached this week in Lower Saxony, a German newspaper reported on Friday.

In a summary of an article for the Leipziger Volkszeitung, made available ahead of publication on Saturday, Klaus Zwickel urged union members to use the Lower Saxony pay deal as a model and accept it "quickly without a lot of fuss".

This would spare individual regions from costly strikes.

The Lower Saxony deal keeps full sick pay benefits, ignoring government legislation allowing cuts in sick pay benefits to 80 percent of wages from 100 percent.

The Gesamtmetall employers federation also rubber stamped the two-year deal, which was struck early on Thursday after 14-hours of talks covering 90,000 workers.

Wages will rise 1.5 percent from next April and by 2.5 percent a year later. Year-end bonuses will be cut, resulting in a small overall rise in costs to employers.

Union chiefs hailed the agreement as a vindication of their industrial action against the sick pay cuts which has hit Germany's metal and engineering sector in recent months.
