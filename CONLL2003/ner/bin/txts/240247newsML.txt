French CFDT union protests against pension bill.

PARIS 1996-12-06

The leader of France's largest CFDT union has written to Prime Minister Alain Juppe protesting against a private pensions bill that would give employers payroll tax relief on contributions to private pensions.

The measure in a bill to introduce private pensions in France would allow employer contributions to be deductible against payroll social security contributions to the tune of 4,000 francs a year plus two percent of annual gross salary.

CFDT said in a statement that the measure could jeopardise the future of the social security system.
