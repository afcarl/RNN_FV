BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind welcomed on Friday the appointment of Madeleine Albright as U.S. Secretary of State, saying she understood Europe's needs.

"I'm delighted that she has been appointed," Rifkind told reporters during a meeting of EU foreign ministers. "I believe she understands the needs of European countries very well. Her own origins are European."

Rifkind said he personally knew Albright, named by President Bill Clinton on Thursday as his choice for secretary of state, and that he had worked well with her.

She is currently the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and senate confirmation of her appointment is expected.
