EU, US end veterinary talks, will meet again soon.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

European Commission and United States officials ended four days of negotiations on Friday without agreeing on the mutual recognition of veterinary standards but will meet again soon, a Commission spokesman said.

"Talks have finished but contacts will resume the week after next," the spokesman said, adding that Washington will meanwhile send more data on its veterinary systems.

Washington is concerned that an estimated $2.0 billion trade in veterinary and phytosanitary products could be disrupted when the EU harmonises import rules in the 15 member states on January 1, 1997, resulting in stricter standards.

Imports of U.S. petfood and other meat products could be blocked due to stricter EU controls against Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) while shipments of other products would be subject to closer inspection, delay and extra cost.

The issue could be discussed at an EU-U.S. summit meeting in Washington on December 16 although Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring told a meeting of EU foreign ministers on Friday that a major effort would be made to resolve the problems beforehand.

The U.S. team, which was led by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman's trade adviser Paul Drazek, had no immediate comment after the talks.
