M6 TV to make advance divdend payout.

PARIS 1996-12-06

French TV group M6 said on Friday it had decided to make an advance net dividend payout of seven francs on december 27.

It said in a statement that it was making the move because the Metropole Television group expected a result in 1996 similar to that of 1995 despite the investment already made in theme and TPS digital statellite television project.

M6 made a similar advance payout last year and the total dividend payment for the year as 13 francs net.
