<headline>Denmark sees problems in draft EU treaty text.</headline>

<p>Denmark, which has a history of coolness towards the European Union, signalled on Friday it had problems with parts of an Irish draft for a revised treaty for the 15-nation bloc.</p>
<p>Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said he was happy with the text on several issues, such as unemployment, openness and the environment, but there were elements Copenhagen could not accept.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the Irish have done a good job but we're very far from a solution,&quot; he told reporters after EU foreign ministers had held a first discussion of the Irish document.</p>
<p>Asked whether Denmark would have most problems concerning the pooling of sovereignty, Petersen said: &quot;That is an element that could be difficult for us.&quot;</p>
<p>He did not elaborate but a Danish diplomat said there were concerns about the suggestion of giving the European Commission greater competence in foreign and external economic relations, for example in the areas of services and intellectual property.</p>
<p>Copenhagen could also have problems with proposed text on giving the EU a &quot;legal personality&quot;, which it does not currently have. The Irish paper says this has hampered the EU's ability to act effectively on the world scene.</p>
<p>But, the diplomat stressed, &quot;In general we are very satisified.&quot;</p>
<p>Some observers in Denmark say the text in the disputed areas could, in its present form, require a referendum because it would hand more powers to Brussels.</p>
<p>Denmark has already had four plebiscites on the EU in the last 25 years.</p>
<p>Petersen said the question of a referendum would not be decided until the final outcome of the negotiations became clear next year.</p>
<p>In a referendum in 1992, Danes threw the Union into turmoil by rejecting the Maastricht treaty. They narrowly approved it in a new popular vote the following year, but only after Denmark won opt-outs from key areas such as monetary union, defence, policing and citizenship arrangements.</p>
<p>In addition, a non-partisan group of 11 Danes has filed suit against the government, saying Denmark's ratification of EU treaties could contravene a clause in the constitution limiting how much national sovereignty may be ceded abroad.</p>
<p>A leading Danish Eurosceptic member of the European Parliament warned last week that the court proceedings could paralyse the Danish government.</p>
<p>&quot;It would not be able to ratify the Maastricht2 treaty until such a time as we have decided whether or not Maastricht1 is in compliance with the Danish constitution,&quot; said Ole Krarup, a member of the European Parliament's Europe of Nations Group.</p>
