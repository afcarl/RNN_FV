EU, U.S. to resume rice, barley talks next week.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

European Commission and U.S. officials will continue efforts next week to resolve rice and malting barley trade disputes, a Commission spokesman said on Friday.

"We will try and work out the problems with them," the spokesman said, adding there was no cause for alarm or crisis.

Washington has complained that the EU's reference price based grain tariff system breaks world trade rules and that Brussels has delayed agreed trade concessions to compensate U.S. exporters for losses after Austria, Sweden and Finland joined the EU.

It wants the EU to introduce a cumulative recovery system to allow traders to claw back excess rice import duties.

The U.S. is also impatient at EU delay in fixing rules for the import of 38,000 tonnes of milled rice and 8,000 tonnes of brown rice duty-free to compensate U.S. exporters for trade losses after the EU's enlargement in 1995.

On Wednesday, the Commission proposed opening a 30,000 tonne tariff quota for imports of U.S. malting barley in 1996 at half the full duty.

It hopes that the proposal, which will be considered by EU farm ministers on December 16-17, will satisfy Washington.

The U.S. team, which was led by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman's trade adviser Paul Drazek, had no immediate comment after the talks.
