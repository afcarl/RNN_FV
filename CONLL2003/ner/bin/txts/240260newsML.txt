Swiss Re sees higher 1996 result.

ZURICH 1996-12-06

Swiss Re, the world's second biggest reinsurer, on Friday said 1996 net profit would grow by well over 20 percent and added it was confident for 1997.

Swiss Re also said it had completed a 1.7 billion sterling ($2.8 billion) acquisition of British group Merchant & General Re, expanding its position as world leader in life and health reinsurance ahead of Munich Re, which is number one in combined life and non-life business.

"Overall, we anticipate that results after tax will increase by significantly more than 20 percent compared with last year, excluding the acquisition of M&G Re," a Swiss Re statement said.

Swiss Re posted an ordinary net profit of 1,092 million Swiss francs in 1995, a 54 percent rise from the year before.

Analysts, who met Swiss Re executives on Friday, said the profit forecast for 1996 was within the range expected.

"There was nothing very new in the forecast," said UBS analyst Thomas Klabermatten, who said he expected to maintain his neutral rating for Swiss Re.

The reinsurer's shares closed 29 Swiss francs weaker at 1,391, down two percent in line with Swiss blue chips amid a general European market slump, but recovered from a day's low of 1,341.

Swiss Re's statement said it had completed the acquisition of London-based M&G Re from Prudential following the granting of all regulatory approvals.

M&G Re, which does almost 80 percent of its business in life and healrth reinsurance, expects a premium volume of 1.4 billion sterling in 1996 after 1.3 billion sterling in 1995.

M&G Re will not be consolidated in the 1996 profit and loss account due to the short year remaining but will be fully consolidated on the balance sheet as of December 31, 1996.

"Capital funds at balance-sheet value should amount to about nine billion Swiss francs after goodwill for M&G Re," a spokesman said.

Swiss Re also said its investment portfolio had performed well.

"The return on investment for 1996 had already exceeded that of the 1995 business year (2,605 million Swiss francs ($2 billion)) by the end of October," it said.

"We expect the underwriting result for the current business year to improve slightly on 1995," Swiss Re added.

It said the year had once again seen an abscence of major natural catastrophes and large individual claims.

"Assuming this remains the case, we will be able to strengthen the provision for catastrophe and major losses substantially," it said.

"In view of developments in the reinsurance market, the acquisition of M&G Re, Swiss Re's market position and the measures which we have implemented to increase earnings, we are confident for 1997, although performance depends largely on major claims experience and developments on the financial markets," it said.
