<headline>Italian markets slide, then attempt to recoup losses.</headline>
<dateline>MILAN 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Italian financial markets fell sharply on Friday after a volatile trading day following overnight comment by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, but then fought to pare back losses by the end of the day.</p>
<p>Greenspan warned late on Thursday of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in U.S. asset markets, sending European share and bond markets lower in early trade, and then pushing U.S. stocks lower on Friday by ignited fears of a possible rise in interest rates.</p>
<p>Italian stocks, bonds and the lira were all hurt by Greenspan's comments but analysts said that Italy had weathered the storm better than most, and now looks to the performance of Wall Street and other U.S. markets for further direction.</p>
<p>The Milan bourse slipped 3.2 percent to a low of 10,200 points at around midday, but then the all-share Mibtel index recovered to close off 1.98 percent at 10,328 points.</p>
<p>&quot;Many overseas stock markets were near their highs while the Italian market was around 30 percent off its highs, therefore the Milan market faired better today,&quot; said Robert Meier, share trader at Milan brokeage Pasfin.</p>
<p>Analysts said that many European bourses, such as Frankfurt, Paris and London, had been around their highs and so fared worse than Milan. They were watching developments on Wall Street for an indication of Monday's opening levels in Milan.</p>
<p>On the Italian bond market, the most-traded LIFFE March futures contract shed around 250 basis points at the height of the day's sell-off but by late trading it had pared back losses to be quoted off 91 basis points at 127.70.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as we close above 127.00 the uptrend isn't broken,&quot; said one broker at an Italian bank in London. &quot;But this is probably the start of a very volatile period on the markets.&quot;</p>
<p>The lira suffered in a busy day with the trader saying the Bank of Italy sold marks for lire around 991-992 per mark shortly before U.S. November jobs data came out, when the currency slid over its 990 central parity against the mark. The lira was around 988 per mark at 1720 GMT.</p>
<p>Dealers said prospects of an Italian interest rate cut, long-awaited and much discussed, has helped to shore up the Italian market in a turbulent international environment.</p>
