Sudeten Germans unhappy with Czech declaration.

BONN 1996-12-06

Ethnic Germans who have posed the main obstacle to a declaration sealing post-World War Two reconciliation between Germany and the Czech Republic said on Friday they were unhappy with the wording of the draft document.

Franz Neubauer, the head of the main group representing the so-called Sudeten Germans, said the declaration was unnecessary as people did not need legislation to be reconciled.

"We have always believed the declaration was unnecessary. We don't need it," he told German Radio. "It is not true that we don't want reconciliation. You cannot order reconciliation with a bit of paper."

He also complained the word "expulsion", which has been the subject of protracted disputes between the two sides, only appeared in one section of the text.

Prague wanted the word "transfer" which is used in the 1945 Potsdam agreement when the victorious World War Two allies authorised the former Czechoslovakia to throw out the Sudetens.

After World War Two 2.5 million ethnic Germans were expelled from Czech territory.

Czech playwright Pavel Kohout dismissed the argument over the choice of words. "It is really just a psychological game," he said on German television. "Both communities have got used to this terminology and I don't believe it has to be changed."

German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Tuesday in Lisbon they believed the lingering dispute between the two states could be resolved soon. Kohl wants the text to be approved by the end of the year.

The declaration, which has been under negotiation for more than a year, is intended to put the Czech Republic on the same friendly footing with Germany as the other countries which suffered Nazi invasion.

Nazi Germany took over Czechoslovakia before the outbreak of war in Europe and kept it under brutal occupation almost until the end of the war.

The Sudeten Germans, backed by the Bavarian CSU who are partners in Kohl's coalition government, have demanded Prague treat them as a full negotiating partner by consulting them directly and that it acknowledge the expulsions were unjust.

Prague has argued the expulsion was legitimate in principle, though often carried out with regrettable brutality. It wants compensation from Germany for victims of the Nazi occupation like that already accorded to other countries.

Germany, which has often felt surrounded by enemies, is eager to build lasting security by bringing its Central and Eastern European neighbours into NATO and the European Union.
