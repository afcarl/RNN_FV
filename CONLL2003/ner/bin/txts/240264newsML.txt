Agip says Caspian pipeline deal signed.

ROME 1996-12-06

Italian oil company Agip SpA said on Friday that a deal had been signed in Moscow to build a $1.5 billion oil pipeline linking Kazakhstan and Russia.

A company statement said the deal on the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) grouped the states of Russia, Kazakhstan and Oman and eight international oil companies.

"The project, which will take two years to complete, will allow an initial flow of oil of around 28 million tonnes a year from the central Asian republics to western markets," AGIP said in its statement.

It said the three governments would together control 50 percent of the consortium, which the remainder distributed among the companies, which would have rights to exploit deposits in the region served by the pipeline.

It said the pipeline would be operated by Russia's state-run Transneft oil pipeline monopoly. The statement made no mention of Transneft taking an equity stake. The companies involved are Chevron, Russia's LUKoil, Mobil and Russia's Rosneft, British Gas Plc, Agip, Oryx Energy Company and Kazakhstan's Munaigaz.

"The agreement provides for the financing of the project ...to be undertaken entirely by the companies which are part of the consortium. Each company will therefore invest a sum equal to double the equity stake it holds," AGIP said.
