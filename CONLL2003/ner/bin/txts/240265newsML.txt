Belgian Bel-20 shares resist heavy losses.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

Shares in the Brussels Bel-20 index fell on Friday on worries of a U.S. interest rate hike but recovered slightly from midday, outperforming shares on other European bourses.

Dealers said eyes were now on how far down the Dow Jones would close, which would determine Monday's Bel-20 performance.

"Everything depends on Wall Street, but today has not been as bloody as expected," said Will Koeke at brokerage Dierickx en Cie.

The Bel-20 share index closed down 1.04 percent or 19.66 points to 1,871.46. The index was down 39 points in morning trade before a benign U.S. payrolls figure boosted markets.

European bourses fell sharply Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets because they could end up damaging the economy.

However, the Bel-20 recovered better than other bourses in afternoon trade, with dealers saying the bourse here had a custom to lag other markets.

"If the Dow falls 300 points today then Monday will be very difficult for the European bourses, but I think Wall Street needs further falls," Koeke said.

Volume was heavy with over 3.8 billion Belgian francs worth of shares changing hands.

Dollar sensitive oil and chemicals firm Petrofina fell 3.04 percent to 10,375 francs.

Koeke said that "Petrofina is the kind of stock that people are afraid to buy when a correction period begins".

But brokerage Vermeulen Raemdonck said the share looked good for the long run with its refining section particularly promising.

Maritime transporter CMB lost 4.11 percent to 2,335 francs after investors took profits.
