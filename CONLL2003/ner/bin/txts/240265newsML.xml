<title>BELGIUM: Belgian Bel-20 shares resist heavy losses.</title>
<headline>Belgian Bel-20 shares resist heavy losses.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in the Brussels Bel-20 index fell on Friday on worries of a U.S. interest rate hike but recovered slightly from midday, outperforming shares on other European bourses.</p>
<p>Dealers said eyes were now on how far down the Dow Jones would close, which would determine Monday's Bel-20 performance.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything depends on Wall Street, but today has not been as bloody as expected,&quot; said Will Koeke at brokerage Dierickx en Cie.</p>
<p>The Bel-20 share index closed down 1.04 percent or 19.66 points to 1,871.46. The index was down 39 points in morning trade before a benign U.S. payrolls figure boosted markets.</p>
<p>European bourses fell sharply Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the Fed must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stock and other asset markets because they could end up damaging the economy.</p>
<p>However, the Bel-20 recovered better than other bourses in afternoon trade, with dealers saying the bourse here had a custom to lag other markets.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Dow falls 300 points today then Monday will be very difficult for the European bourses, but I think Wall Street needs further falls,&quot; Koeke said.</p>
<p>Volume was heavy with over 3.8 billion Belgian francs worth of shares changing hands.</p>
<p>Dollar sensitive oil and chemicals firm Petrofina fell 3.04 percent to 10,375 francs.</p>
<p>Koeke said that &quot;Petrofina is the kind of stock that people are afraid to buy when a correction period begins&quot;.</p>
<p>But brokerage Vermeulen Raemdonck said the share looked good for the long run with its refining section particularly promising.</p>
<p>Maritime transporter CMB lost 4.11 percent to 2,335 francs after investors took profits.</p>
