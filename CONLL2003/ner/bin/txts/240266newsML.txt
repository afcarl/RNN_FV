D.Babcock workers sacrifice vacation bonus.

OBERHAUSEN, Germany 1996-12-06

Domestic employees of the troubled German engineering and plant construction group Deutsche Babcock AG agreed to go without a vacation bonus next year, the company said on Friday.

Babcock, which has been divesting assets amid steep losses, said the sacrifice of its 25,000 German employees would achieve savings of between 80 million and 100 million marks, but that it has not made any job guarantees in return.

But the workforce might not have to forego the bonus entirely. The company added that it had agreed with the works council and IG Metall union to pay the bonus as soon as the company is back in the black.

The company has said in the past that it expects to make a loss in the 1995/96 business year.
