Belgian cen.bank more pessimistic on state finance.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

The Belgian central bank on Friday revised its forecast for the Belgian state's 1996 deficit to 3.3 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), from 3.1 percent in August.

The forecast, made in the bank's weekly economic indicators statement, is in line with the government's forecast.

At the presentation of the 1997 budget in October, the government said it estimated the 1996 deficit at 3.3 percent, although the 1996 budget was drafted with a 3.0 percent target.

It blamed the shortfall on an unexpected economic slowdown.

The 1995 deficit was 4.1 percent of GDP. The 1997 target is 2.9 percent.
