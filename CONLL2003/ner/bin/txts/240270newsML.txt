Key Club Med shareholders end pact.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Club Mediteranee said in a statement that its key shareholders had ended a shareholders pact they had agreed in 1990.

The shareholders concerned are the state-bank Caisse des Depots et de Consignation (CDC), Compagnie Financiere Benjamin et Edmond de Rothschild, Exor, Nippon Life Insurance Company and Rolaco.

Exor is majority owned by Sheik Abdullazziz al-Sulaiman.

The group owned a total of 29 percent in Club Med.  

Credit Lyonnais and Seibu Saison had left the pact previously.

The pact held the partners to give the others the first right of refusal in case of a share sale and also limited individual stakes to 13 percent.
