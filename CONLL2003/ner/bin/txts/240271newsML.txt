PM's staff no view on Cr foncier profit - sources.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Staff of Prime Minister Alain Juppe did not discuss the profits of Credit Foncier at a meeting with trade union representatives from the property loans group earlier this week, government sources said on Friday.

Earlier an official from the CFDT union told Reuters that advisors from Juppe's office who met union representatives on Tuesday had acknowledged that a first-half profit at the group was not a one-off event but could recur.

Unions are raising the tempo of a campaign against plans by Finance Minister Jean Arthuis to wind down Credit Foncier after a takeover by CDC state bank which Arthuis requested and of which the result is due on Monday.

On Friday, national union leaders took up the issue, with Louis Viannet, head of the Communist-led CGT union and Alain Deleu, head of the moderate CFTC union, making personal statements calling for the Arthuis plan to be halted.
