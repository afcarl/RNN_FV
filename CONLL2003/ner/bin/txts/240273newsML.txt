EU Commission plans energy tax offensive.

The European Commission is discussing a draft proposal to bring natural gas, coal and electricity under EU legislation on minimum excise taxes on mineral oils, Commission and industry sources said on Friday.

The action was requested by the Essen European Council in 1994 after the EU failed to agree on a so-called CO2 tax to reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the European Union.

The Commission is also to propose increasing the existing minimum taxes on such products as petrol, leaded petrol, diesel and heating fuel.

But a Commission official said this was unlikely to affect prices in the short and medium term since the actual rates applied by most national governments were well above the EU minimums.

According to a draft directive currently being discussed in the Commission services, the minimum rate of duty on petrol would increase to 450 European currency units per 1,000 litres on January 1, 1998 from a current minimum of 337 Ecus. The proposal foresees further increases to 500 Ecus in 2,000 and 557 Ecus in 2002.

The Commission suggests that EU states apply a higher rate to leaded petrol than to unleaded petrol.

At the beginning of 1995, the excise rate for leaded petrol in Germany was 562 Ecus, in France it was 585 Ecus, in Italy 527 Ecus and in Britain 462, according to a Commission report on excise duties on mineral oils, tobacco and alcohol.

On diesel oil used as motor fuel, the Commission proposes an increase in the minimum rate to 343 Ecus per 1,000 litres from a current 245 Ecus. It would rise further to 393 Ecus in 2000 and 450 Ecus in 2,002.

Current diesel rates in Germany, France and Italy are above 300 Ecus. In Britain it stands at 400 Ecus.

Electricity, which is not currently included in the EU legislation, would be taxed 1.0 Ecu per megawatt/hour in 1998, 2.0 Ecus in 2000 and 3.0 Ecus in 2002.

The draft suggests that EU states exempt air navigation fuels from taxation but only "for as long as such products are obliged to be exempted under international obligations".

Currently kerosene used for international flights is exempt from tax under the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

But the EU is discussing with its major partners in the framework of the climate changes draft convention whether to scrap the rules.

"It is very difficult to go to the climate changes negotiations if your own internal rules provide for an obligatory exemption," a Commission tax official told Reuters.

The official hoped the Commission's draft directive on the taxation of energy products would be adopted in January. He did not expect any "substantial changes" to be made to the final text that will be submitted to the full Commission.

As for all taxation issues, the draft directive will have to be adopted unanimously by the ECOFIN Council.

Energy-intensive industries such as the the automobile and chemicals sectors expressed concern that the plan will further dent Europe's competitiveness on the world market.

"This is not compatible with the prime goal of competitiveness, unless energy sources for industrial use are exempted or, at the very least, that tax rates are aligned to the lowest levels charged by our competitors outside Europe," the European Lime Association (EULA) said in a statement.

EULA says it speaks on behalf of eight associations including the International Federation of Industrial Energy Consumers, the European Chemical Industry Council and the European Car Manufacturers Association.
