Generali sees 1996 profits ahead.

MILAN 1996-12-06

Italy's largest insurance group Generali said on Friday that its life business helped lift nine-month 1996 premium income nearly 10 percent, while it saw profits in 1996 ahead of the previous year.

The giant insurer, based in the Italian northeastern city of Trieste, said its group premium income rose 9.7 percent to 21.15 trillion lire ($13.9 billion) but gave no breakdown, and added it expected group net profits ahead of 1995's 695 billion lire.

Generali said its parent premium income rose 8.6 percent to 7.99 trillion lire, with life premium income up 18.4 percent at 3.78 trillion lire and non-life income up 1.1 percent at 4.21 trillion lire.

A company statement said on the basis of results so far in 1996 and given the positive trend of premium business and the expectation of lira stability, it expected a final 1996 result "better than that in the preceding year", although the company warned it had to take into account exchange rate effects.

Generali warned that its premium claims ratio worsened by 0.5 percent, but that tight control of costs saw its ratio of premiums sold to cost of sales improve by 0.7 percent.

"The results were good, better than expected, helped by the strength of the life business, while the group is benefiting from cost cutting," said analyst Paula Buratti at Indosuez.

She is expecting group net profits for 1996 in excess of one trillion lire after 695 billion lire in 1995, boosted by the capital gain from the sale of Generali's stake in French insurance group AXA earlier this year.

Shares in Generali held up better than most in a lower Milan market closing down 1.47 percent at 29,835 lire. ($ = 1519 Italian Lire)
