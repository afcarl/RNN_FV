<p>Moslem fundamentalists killed 19 civilians in a village near Algiers in a second night of carnage, bringing to 29 the number of dead in overnight attacks within 48 hours, Algerian security forces said on Friday.</p>
<p>In both killings, the security forces said the victims were &quot;assassinated in a cowardly way&quot; -- Algerian authorities' shorthand for having their throats cut.</p>
<p>The attacks followed a lull in raids on isolated communities since a November 28 referendum to change Algeria's constitution and ban political parties based on religion.</p>
<p>&quot;Arm us. We cannot defend ourselves with our bare chests,&quot; villagers shouted at Solidarity Minister Rabea Mechernene when he visited Ben-Salah village after one November attack.</p>
<p>The latest raids appeared to defy President Liamine Zeroual's statement earlier this week on the referendum result which showed 84.6 percent of voters backing his proposed reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;In approving the constitutional revision project...the Algerian people have reaffirmed with force their own convictions towards all those who doubt their capacity and determination to overcome the crisis....&quot; Zeroual said, adding that the constitution would come into force within days.</p>
<p>Algerian authorities said the referendum, under tight security, was free of violence. Independent newspapers said at least 26 people died in bombings and other attacks.</p>
<p>Since early November, despite tight censorship in Algeria, at least 190 people have been reported killed in the conflict between Algerian security forces and Moslem fundamentalists, according to independent and other sources.</p>
<p>Algerian security forces, in a statement carried by the official news agency APS, blamed &quot;a group of terrorists&quot; for Thursday night's carnage in Benachour village in the province of Blida 50 km (30 miles) south of Algiers.</p>
<p>One night earlier, 10 people were killed by suspected fundamentalists on a farm in the same province.</p>
<p>Algeria's Armed Islamic Group (GIA) is suspected for most of the attacks whose ruthlessness has stunned even Algerians inured to violence after five years of conflict in which about 60,000 people have been killed.</p>
<p>In one of the most deadly raids early in November more than 30 people -- including one newlywed woman killed in her bed -- were killed one by one by having their throats slit.</p>
<p>A further 12, including four women and three children, died one week later in the tiny village of Douar Ben-Salah where they were dragged from their homes to die.</p>
<p>French authorities on Friday were investigating possible involvement of Algeria's GIA in a bomb attack this week in Paris in which three people were killed and 94 wounded.</p>
<p>Algerian fundamentalists were blamed for similar bombings last year in France in which eight people were killed and more than 160 wounded. The Islamists accuse France, Algeria's former colonial master, of supporting the authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;France fights Moslems, that's why we maintain the same attitude towards this country as our predecessors, the emirs of the GIA,&quot; the French newspaper Liberation this week quoted GIA leader Antar Zouabri as writing in September in the clandestine Al Jamaar newsletter.</p>
