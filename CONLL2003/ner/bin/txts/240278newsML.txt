Views mixed on future direction for Belgian bonds.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

Belgian linear bonds, down in line with the rest of Europe on Friday in heavy volume could go either way on Monday, with views mixed on whether the market's recent rampant rise was over or simply taking a breather.

"Opinions are divided. Some people remain bullish while others are turning bearish," one trader said. "One thing that is true is that there is still an appetite to buy on the dips."

"I hate that kind of question. Nobody knows what will happen on Monday. There are still some uncompleted buy programmes out there, but if New York goes down then you can bet we will too," another trader said.  

Traders said the Belgian bond market saw heavy selling by domestic players on Friday following U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning late on Thursday that the global rally was getting out of hand.

Selling was particularly noticeable along the middle of the maturity range, traders said.

"It was a day of bearish humping of the yield curve," one trader said. "The market did as much business in a few hours as we normally see in a week."

"The spread over Bunds widened a bit but remained small which is good for Belgium," another trader said.  

"It was a fairly good day with high volatility," the trader added.

The yield of the benchmark 2006 OLO rose to 5.97 percent from Thursday's closing 5.85, and the spread over German Bunds widened to 10 basis points from Thursday's eight.

The December futures contract ended 91 basis points down at 120.44, having moved in a 120.88/120.16 range.
