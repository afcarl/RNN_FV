Elf Feyzin to end strike after new talks.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Workers at Elf Aquitaine's Feyzin refinery in southern France will follow two other plants back to work after a nine-day strike, but only after pressing demands for strike pay and compensation, a union official said.

The decision to return to work in coming days comes despite an overwhelming vote at the 128,000 barrels per day plant to stay on strike and reject an Elf pay offer, said the official from the Socialist CFDT union.

But a return to work became inevitable when workers at two others plants, the 214,000 bpd Donges refinery and the 98,000 bpd Grandpuits refinery, called off the strike, she said.  

"We can't go on by ourselves," the official said. "We will end the strike but not straightaway. We have demands on strike pay and other local compensation," she said.

Unions would press these demands with local Elf management in coming days, she added.

Workers at Elf's two other French refineries voted to resume work on the next shift later on Friday.

Donges workers also initially voted to stay out but were swayed by the decision by workers at Grandpuits to accept an Elf pay offer, unions said. The votes bring towards an end a strike that cost France's largest oil firm a sum traders estimate at millions of dollars.
