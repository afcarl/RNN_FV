Milan stocks recover some poise after Greenspan.

MILAN 1996-12-06

Italian stocks pared early losses by the close of business on Friday showing that Milan had suffered less from the surprise comments by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan than other European markets and Wall Street.

Greenspan warned overnight of "irrational exuberance" in U.S. asset markets, sending European share and bond markets lower in early trade, and then sending U.S. stocks lower today by ignited fears of a possible rise in interest rates.

Dealers pointed out since Milan was not near the highs it suffered less. The all-share Mibtel index slipped 1.98 percent to 10,328 with the Mib30 off 2.18 percent at 15,412.

Analysts said many European bourse, such as Frankfurt, Paris and London, had been around their highs and so succumbed worse than Milan. They were watching the progress of Wall Street for an indication of Monday's opening levels in Milan.

At one stage, around midday, the Mibtel index had fallen to the day's low, off 3.2 percent to 10,200, but markets were slightly comforted by U.S. November jobs numbers and attempted to pare losses while Wall Street moved off the lows.

"Greenspan's comments took the markets by surprise, but after the initial shock, markets are attempting a partial recovery," said one share trader.

Dealers said that volumes were fairly higher with daily trade at just over one trillion lire.

Some added weakness today came from Germany, where Bundesbank's official Jochimsen warned that monetary policy can not prop up economic growth. This sent German stocks lower and weighed on other European bourses.

Among individual stocks, insurer Generali showed relative strength ending down just 1.47 percent at 29,835 lire after above expected nine-month 1996 premium income figures.

Fiat shares were off 1.77 percent at 4,446 lire, Pirelli down 2.00 percent to 2,791 lire, and Montedison eased 1.52 percent to 1,034 lire.
