Gold to stay in $366-375 range next week - Dresdner.

FRANKFURT 1996-12-06

Gold bullion was likely to maintain a range of $366-375 per ounce over the next five trading days, Dresdner Bank said in its weekly precious metals report on Friday.

Gold was underpinned by physical demand at the three-and-a-half-year low of $366 hit on Tuesday and limited on the upside by looming producer sales, the bank wrote.

Thin pre-Christmas trades should also prevent high volatility.

In a volatile dollar scenario, the bank recommended purchases at 570 marks per ounce and sales above 580 marks. --Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275
