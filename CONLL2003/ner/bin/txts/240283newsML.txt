Union confirms second Elf refinery back to work.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Unions confirmed on Friday that a second French Elf refinery had voted to return to work but said workers at the third strike-hit plant were undecided.

Workers at Donges in western France originally voted in a ballot to reject an Elf pay offer and stay on strike but changed their minds when they heard that the Grandpuits refinery, near Paris, had voted to go back to work, a CFDT union official said.

He said workers at Feyzin, regarded as the most militant of the Elf French plants, had originally decided by a larger majority than the strikers at Donges to keep up the protest.

But they too were now voting again, having heard the Grandpuits decision, he said.
