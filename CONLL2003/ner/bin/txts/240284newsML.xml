<headline>German court delays ruling on Nazi slave workers.</headline>

<p>A German court on Friday delayed a decision until the end of January that could pave the way for hundreds of prisoners in Hitler's slave labour camps to be awarded compensation for being victimes of Nazi injustice.</p>
<p>The civil court could not reach a decision on whether 22 former slave workers should receive compensation and, if so, how much they would be entitled to.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision will be made on January 31,&quot; said Klaus-Andreas Nagel, a lawyer for the claimants, after the court proceedings ended. &quot;We hope the decision will go our way.&quot;</p>
<p>Nagel said one of the reasons the decision was delayed was that the lawyers for the claimants had recently increased the amount of compensation they were looking for.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Court ruled in July that foreign citizens' claims for their unpaid work could not be rejected out of hand as violating international law. But it said they might be turned down if already covered by specific bilateral agreements with their countries of origin.</p>
<p>It said German citizens could be entitled to make claims as well.</p>
<p>The case concerns 21 women and one man, all of them Jewish. Before World War Two they were of German, Hungarian and Polish nationality but now all except three have taken Israeli citizenship. Two are U.S. citizens and one is Canadian.</p>
<p>If the claimants win their case it could pave the way for landmark awards for hundreds of other former slave labourers.</p>
<p>The Nazis forced hundreds of thousands of Jews, mainly from Eastern Europe, some prisoners of war and other deportees to work under appalling conditions for German companies.</p>
<p>But since the end of the war the German government has rejected individual claims from the survivors who helped to boost profits for German industry during the Third Reich.</p>
<p>It said these were covered in post-war bilateral agreements and that they could only be addressed once Germany concluded peace treaties with former foes and countries it occupied -- something Germany had never done formally. Others were deemed invalid as they were lodged &quot;too late&quot;.</p>
<p>Some firms that profited from slave labour were closed down after the war. Some, for example Volkswagen AG, are still in place while others have legal successors.</p>
<p>The most notorious company was the chemical giant IG Farben which made &quot;Zyklon B&quot; for the gas chambers of Auschwitz and other concentration camps.</p>
<p>IG Farben was the world's fourth-largest company until the end of the war. The allies broke it down into three firms -- Bayer AG, BASF AG and Hoechst AG.</p>
