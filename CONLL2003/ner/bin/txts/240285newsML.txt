U.S. says Iraqi sanctions won't be lifted soon.

UNITED NATIONS 1996-12-06

Deputy American U.N. ambassador Edward Gnehm said Friday while the United States fully supported the "oil-for-food" deal with Iraq, sanctions "are not going to be lifted any time soon."

He was speaking to reporters after the Security Council received a briefing from chief U.N. arms inspector Rolf Ekeus, who is due in Baghdad Sunday and will focus on Iraq's refusal last month to permit the removal of destroyed missile engines for analysis in the United States.  

Gnehm said there was no connection between the "oil-for-food' deal, expected to go into effect very soon, and sanctions imposed on Iraq after its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

"It is my government's view, and I think that of most council members, those sanctions are not going to be lifted any time soon with the kind of behaiour we are seeing Iraq display today."  

Referring to the Security Council resolution on which the "oil-for-food" arrangement is based, Gnehm said: "We are virtually on the threshhold of implementing resolution 986. And I would repeat today what you have often heard me say, which is that the United States firmly supports that resolution...sees it very much as a humanitarian response to needs in Iraq.

"It is not... a change in the sanctions regime or in any way an initial step in removing sanctions on Iraq."

He said the sanctions related to Iraqi compliance with a key 1991 council resolution calling for the scrapping of weapons of mass destruction and other measures, such as providing information on missing Kuwaitis and returning military and other items stolen from Kuwait.

Ekeus told reporters the analysis of missile engines which Iraq said it destroyed in 1991 without U.N. supervision, and which U.N. inspectors unearthed last month, was needed to provide an exact accounting of any remaining missile stocks.

He has said in the past that between six and 16 missiles were unaccounted for.

Ekeus said it was regular practice for the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) which he heads to remove Iraqi weapons and related items for analysis abroad. But last month Iraq had prevented the removal of the missile engines for analysis at a laboratory in the United States.

"The question should be put to Iraq: why did they suddenly break an established practice," he added.
