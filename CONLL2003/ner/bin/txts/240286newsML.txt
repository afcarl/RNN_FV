PARIS 1996-12-06

The sharp correction on the Paris stock market on Friday put an effective end to the rally for 1996, with a total rise of 19.7 percent, but the underlying trend is positive and 1997 will see further rises.

Fund managers and economists said that the market still had good prospects post-December but the end of year target was at 2,200, about Friday's level.

"I remain relatively confident. I do not think that the trend has been broken," said Jean-Michel Maingain, fund manager at CDC-Gestion.

"The correction is spectacular but if you look at the charts we are at a level we were 15 days ago. The engine has not been cut, we are simply in a horizontal consolidation zone," said Jean-Francois Legoux, director at SBC-Brinson.

Christopher Potts, economist at Chevreux de Virieu, said the sharpness of the correction was explained by profit taking by fund manager who did not want to spoil their 1996 results.

"This week marks the end of the financial year for all the markets, the dollar, the bond market and the Bourse. But that does not mean that the trend will be turned, there is not a single fundamental reason for that," he said.

Potts points to the last U.S. jobless figures which seemed to confirm an economic slowdown. The number of jobs created in the U.S. was 118,000 in November while the market was expecting a number of 179,000.

The French market fell 2.26 percent on Friday and 3.28 percent on the week.

"The good thing about this slide is that the speculative balloon is leaking. The overbought shares are getting back to more fair levels, we are going to reposition our portfolios and be more selective and look mainly at fundamentals," a fund manager said.

Market analysts said they had expected a correction because Paris was close to historic highs, but they had not expected the sell-off to be a steep as it was this morning.

Analysts at Paribas, CSFB and J.P Morgan said their end-year target for the CAC-40 remained 2,200.

"December is not going to be brilliant. The market is still expensive when compared with other markets and there at no signs of any recovery in economic fundamentals that would justify the profit expectations," said Jean-Luc de Lamaze, an analyst who follows the French market for CSFB in London.

"Recently there have been uncertainties on the monetary front and the Thomson decision has damanged the country's reputation in the eyes of investors," he added.

"There is a feeling that there is a social blockade and that does not entice investors; they will keep outside the market," De Lamaze said.

"The Greenspan comments were an excuse to take profits," said Gary Dugan, French equity analyst at JP Morgan in London.

"In Paris we had been trading some seven to eight percent above the 90-day moving average and we were expecting a correction," he said.
