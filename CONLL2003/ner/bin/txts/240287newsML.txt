ARA bunkers dip, European buying dries up.

AMSTERDAM 1996-12-06

ARA bunkers dipped on Friday, while prices in other European ports were steady, but buying everywhere dried up as crude oil tumbled.

Crude's weakness came after reports that Iraq oil exports may flow on Tuesday.

Rotterdam 380 cst dipped by $1/$2 a tonne to $126/$127 fob as the barge market made only a partial recovery from initial sharp losses.

Immediate deliveries remained tight, but the supply from Rotterdam next week were expected to improve. Many buyers also covered midweek.

"Almost all of (the buyers) have delayed their decisions until next week as they believe the prices will be weaker then," one supplier said.

Hamburg prices were also marginally lower and buyers were scarce.

Bunkers in Mediterranean ports were mostly steady and demand everywhere was low.

Spanish ports were quietened by a national holiday.
