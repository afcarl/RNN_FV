<title>NETHERLANDS: ARA bunkers dip, European buying dries up.</title>
<headline>ARA bunkers dip, European buying dries up.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>ARA bunkers dipped on Friday, while prices in other European ports were steady, but buying everywhere dried up as crude oil tumbled.</p>
<p>Crude's weakness came after reports that Iraq oil exports may flow on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Rotterdam 380 cst dipped by $1/$2 a tonne to $126/$127 fob as the barge market made only a partial recovery from initial sharp losses.</p>
<p>Immediate deliveries remained tight, but the supply from Rotterdam next week were expected to improve. Many buyers also covered midweek.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost all of (the buyers) have delayed their decisions until next week as they believe the prices will be weaker then,&quot; one supplier said.</p>
<p>Hamburg prices were also marginally lower and buyers were scarce.</p>
<p>Bunkers in Mediterranean ports were mostly steady and demand everywhere was low.</p>
<p>Spanish ports were quietened by a national holiday.</p>
