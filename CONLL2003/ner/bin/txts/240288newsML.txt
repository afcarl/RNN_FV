Italian bonds/futures closing report.

MILAN 1996-12-06

Italian debt markets ended some 100 basis points down, looking dishevelled at the end of a rough and volatile day following comments by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan about "irrational exuberance" on markets.

The March Btp future on LIFFE shed around 250 basis points at the height of the day's sell-off but by 1620 GMT it had calmed down to stand 112 basis points lower at 127.49.

"As long as we close above 127.00 the uptrend isn't broken," one broker at an Italian bank in London said. "But this is probably the start of a very volatile period on the markets."

The July 2006 Btp ended 105 basis points down at 108.25.  

Greenspan said late on Thursday the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infected markets because they could end up damaging the economy, leading traders to think of the possibility of U.S. interest rate rises down the line.

The lira suffered in the general hurly burly that followed and traders said the Bank of Italy sold marks for lire around 991-992 per mark shortly before U.S. jobs data came out, when the currency slid over its 990 central parity against the mark.

The lira was back at 987.00/7.50 per mark by 1635 GMT. Dealers said there was some usual Friday night speculation that the Bank of Italy cut interest rates but many were sceptical.  

They said the Bank of Italy was likely to wait for the budget bill to pass in the upper house or Senate later this month, when preliminary December inflation data were known.

The prospect of an interest rate cut, long-awaited and much discussed, has helped to shore up the Italian market in a turbulent international environment, traders said.

U.S. non-farm payrolls data helped offset some fears about interest rates but markets were also hit by comments from Bundesbank member Reimut Jochimsen who said there was no need for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth.
