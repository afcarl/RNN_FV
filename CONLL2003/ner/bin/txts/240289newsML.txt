Elf says second French plant ends strike.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Workers at Elf Aquitaine's  Donges refinery in western France voted on Friday to end a nine-day-old strike and return to work at 2000 GMT, an Elf company spokesman said.

There was no immediate confirmation from union officials at the 214,000 barrels per day plant, where strikers had organised a ballot on whether to accept an Elf pay offer.

Workers at the smaller Grandpuits refinery near Paris voted earlier on Friday to accept Elf's offer and end their action.

A third refinery, Feyzin near Lyon, regarded by union officials as the most militant of the Elf plants, were still voting but strike leaders there said the mood still appeared determined.
