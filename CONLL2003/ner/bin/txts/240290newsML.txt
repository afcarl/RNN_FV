S&P cuts Credit National debt rating.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Standard & Poor's said on Friday it had lowered the rating of long-term debt issued by French banks Credit National and Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur and their subsidiaries to A minus from A.

The rating agency said in a statement it had also cut the short-term debt rating of paper issued by the two banks to A-2 to A-1.

It said the outlook for the long-term debt rating remained negative.  

The statement also said debt issued by the two banks which carried a French government guarantee was not affected by the downgrade.

Credit National acquired all of BFCE's capital this year and the two banks will finish their merger in 1997.
