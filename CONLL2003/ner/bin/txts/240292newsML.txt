FORECAST - Portugal bonds to hold spread over bund.

Portugal's benchmark 10-year cash bonds should continue to track the German bunds at a distance of around 125 basis points, despite the turbulence on world markets, traders said on Friday.

Traders said that belief in Portugal's chances of qualifying for the European Union's single currency remained strong and therefore there was no reason for the spread to widen.

The spread stood at 128 basis points at 1610 GMT after widening to 136 at one point as international bond and stock prices tumbled on Friday.

The selling was triggered by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning about "irrational exuberance" on the markets which was interpreted as a hint that a U.S. rate rise could be on the cards.

"I believe that the spread of around 125 basis points will be maintained despite the complications of the moment," said analyst Mario Vigario of Morgan Grenfell.

"Nothing has changed with regard to our convergence for monetary union, therefore there are no reasons to think that the spread must widen," added one fixed-income trader.

Analysts said that the 10-year spread with Spain, which was closed for a holiday on Friday, could oscillate between zero and a negative 20 basis points.

"This turbulence did not trigger any great currency pressure, inflation is going to continue to ease in 1997, and the budget deficit will decline. Economic convergence (with Europe's strongest economies) is at hand," said an analyst at one investment bank.

Analysts said that the Bank of Portugal would still have room to cut interest rates again and this should help steepen the yield curve which had become overly flat.

"For periods up to five years, there is no reason to be in a hurry to sell. On the contrary, there could be room for (price) gains," said the investment bank analyst.

"In the next three months, there is room for short-term rates to ease another 50 basis points, particularly if Italy and Spain cut rates," Vigario said.

"It would be reasonable for the curve between three months and 10 years to steepen around 50 basis points," he added.

Analysts said that another factor that should help to steady nerves on the Portuguese market was the relative lack of supply, particularly at the longer end.

"The Treasury is enjoying one of its best years for a long time and has no need to issue large amounts. The big banks are not going to get caught up in any panic selling and there is a lot of paper parked in investment portfolios," one analyst said.
