<title>FRANCE: French capital markets closing report.</title>
<headline>French capital markets closing report.</headline>

<p>French bond futures were sent on a roller coaster ride during the busiest session for French bond futures since March 1995 and settled down more than a point, unable to resist the weight of the declines in U.S. bond prices.</p>
<p>Already reeling from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's remarks overnight, French bonds then tumbled to the day's low of 127.58 after a Bundesbank council member poured cold water on expectations for rates cuts anytime soon.</p>
<p>A smaller-than-expected rise in U.S. job creation in November gave the bond future a lift, but it failed to cling onto all of its gains and drifted down into the close.  </p>
<p>Traders said although the selloff had been brutal it had served a purpose in purging some of the long positions after the recent rally and that the fundamentals remained positive.</p>
<p>One reservation, however, was that the closing price was not particularly positive from a technical point of view, although as long as the Bund contract held above 100.0 the situation could improve, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It has to be said there is no real danger of inflation and nobody thinks there will be a rate rise,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>A trader at a French bank said that although the contract had fallen through several key technical levels, the fact it had recouped some of its losses meant next week's target would probably be the gap between 128.74 and 129.14 opened today.</p>
<p>He said he thought the contract would now probably trade within the week's high of 130.18 and the low of 127.58 for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Sonja Gibbs, bond strategist at Nomura International, said the payrolls number wasn't a bad number, although she had reservations about the rise in hourly earnings, the problem was &quot;people are still very long.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Given the impact of the Greenspan comments they're going to use rallies to sell every time it spikes up,&quot; Gibbs said.</p>
<p>&quot;The feeling for a long time has been that some volatility would be more welcome, at any pretext, and to some extent Greenspan is a pretext,&quot; she said. &quot;It's not anthing he hasn't said before, it was just timing.&quot;</p>
<p>Philippe Brossard, head of research at ABN Amro in Paris, said &quot;it was an interesting big correction, an unexpected move. Nobody knew markets would turn so nasty yesterday afternoon. But U.S. long bonds were already too expensive given the yield curve.&quot;  </p>
<p>Analysts said the main focus next week would be the tone of the U.S. bond market and the likely outcome of the stability pact negotiations which many hope will be settled at the Dublin summit next weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;I basically thing the Germans aren't going to change their stance. Rather than accept much of a compromise they would far rather wait,&quot; said Gibbs at Nomura.</p>
<p>Analysts said Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen's rate comments, and the upcoming stability pact negotiations would probably prompt the Bank of France to leave rates unchanged after its council meeting next week.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Bank of France is likely to keep rates unchanged. The hawks are still furious with the doves and I do not see them easing ahead of Dublin summit,&quot; Brossard said. &quot;We don't really know what's going to emerge and how the Bundesbank will react.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think they're going to hang tight, with German preaching so hard about rates cuts,&quot; Gibbs said.</p>
