PARIS 1996-12-06

French retailer Carrefour chairman Daniel Bernard reiterated in a newspaper interview his forecast of a 20 percent rise in net attributable, pre-exceptional profit in 1996 and the opening of more than 30 stores abroad in 1997.

"I confirm that the net attributable pre-exceptional profit will grow by around 20 percent this year," Bernard said in an interview to appear in the Saturday edition of the Journal des Finances.

The group first forecast this profit increase in September.

It made a net attributable, pre-exceptional profit of 2.690 billion francs in 1995.

Barnard also said he expected investment in foreign store openings of close to 10 billion francs next year.
