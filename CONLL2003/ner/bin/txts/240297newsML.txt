Has justice gone mad?, Italians ask.

For almost five years, the Italian magistrates who blew a cosy, corrupt system apart with their "Clean Hands" graft investigations have been hailed as heroes.

Now Italians wonder whether the justice system is in crisis, with magistrates probing other magistrates and political enemies using friendly prosecutors to fight their battles.

Last week, reports leaked that a magistrate wanted to try centre-left Prime Minister Romano Prodi, a respected economist who took office six months ago with a pledge to renew Italy, for alleged malpractice when he ran state holding IRI.

This week, a senior leftist politician, Giovanni Pellegrino, said magistrates had a "strategic design" on power.

On Friday, some 300 police raided homes and offices of Antonio Di Pietro, former star of the "Clean Hands" pool and a minister until last month, in a probe into the methods he used to expose Italy's Tangentopoli (Bribesville) scandal.

"It's been a week of fire, with the re-opening of the debate on an amnesty for Tangentopoli, the investigations into the prime minister, the dubious theories of Pellegrino and now the umpteenth legal twist in the Di Pietro Case," Senate (upper house) deputy speaker Ersilia Salvato said on Friday.

"I feel the need to sound the alarm over the way in which justice is still being used as a weapon," she said.

A fixation with magistrates and their enquiries hits the headlines every day as politicians debate whether the "Clean Hands" phenomenon has got out of control and whether an amnesty is needed despite evidence that corruption is not on the wane.

The Tangentopoli scandals which broke in 1992 exposed a web of dirty dealing in politics and business and forced the political old guard out of power.

As hundreds of those cases continue to chug through Italy's painstakingly slow courts, magistrates in September uncovered a fresh scandal immediately dubbed "Tangentopoli 2" in which an alleged super-lobby of businessmen, judges and lawyers paid bribes to win contracts or fix trials.

Conservative former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, himself on trial in two separate corruption cases, has warned of a "judicial emergency".

Luciano Violante, speaker of the Chamber of Deputies (lower house) and an ex-magistrate, has spoken out about a "judicial republic" while veteran commentator Indro Montanelli denounced what he called a damaging "guerrilla war" between magistrates that risks casting doubt on the whole "Clean Hands" operation.

Justice Minister Giovanni Maria Flick, who has repeatedly ruled out an official investigation into the "Clean Hands" pool, told Corriere della Sera on Friday that the atmosphere was "incandescent" and he wanted a "normal" justice system.

"To say the magistrature should take a step backwards may seem a reproof for its achievements," he said.

But he said magistrates ought to go back to concentrating on specific cases in their own towns and take a back seat to politicians.

Di Pietro, who sensationally resigned from the judiciary two years ago shortly after the pool placed Berlusconi under investigation, was Prodi's public works minister until he quit that job last month saying he had to defend the "Clean Hands" investigations from critics trying to destroy its success.

He has never fully explained why he abandoned his legal career and the subject seemed closed when magistrates in the northern town of Brescia dropped three probes into his conduct.

But Brescia magistrates launched a fresh investigation last month, prompting Di Pietro to quit as a minister. He says he is a victim of a vendetta, an ironic echo of Berlusconi who has accused the judiciary of mounting a witch hunt against him.
