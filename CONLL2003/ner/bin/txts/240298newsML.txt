German Bund futures reeling from heavy losses.

FRANKFURT 1996-12-06

German Bunds and futures reeled from heavy losses inflicted on Thursday and Friday, with dealers saying bullish sentiment had taken a hammering and the market would not necessarily resume its upward path.

Dealers were divided over whether the market, which had reached record highs in the last week, had taken a decisive turn downwards, or whether it had just suffered a temporary setback. "Everyone is somewhat shocked by the fall," said one.

The March Bund future was down 85 basis points at 99.74 by 1612 GMT, but off the day's low of 99.57.
