EU says part of Kozloduy nuclear plant can open.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

The European Union said on Friday safety tests had shown that Bulgaria should be allowed to open part of its Kozloduy nuclear plant, but that the whole plant should be closed when the country finds other forms of energy.

The European Commission said in a statement EU and Bulgarian experts had agreed after an examination that the reactor's Unit 1 could be reopened as the tests had shown it could be operated normally.

"The experts concluded that the condition of the material of the pressure vessel of reactor No 1...allows the safe operation of the reactor pressure vessel...," it said.

"This information...will be used as the basis for the formal application for the plant's operators to the Bulgarian Nuclear Safety Authority for restart of the unit," the EU executive said in a statement.

But as the design and construction of the four units at the plant do not fully meet safety standards generally accepted in the 15-nation EU, "the Commission considers that these units should be permanently closed as soon as alternative energy supplies are available," it added.

It noted that closure was in any case foreseen in a 1993 EU-Bulgaria agreement on nuclear safety.

"The European Commission therefore urges the Bulgarian government to develop alternative energy supplies and improve energy efficienty," it said.

It added that as long as the plant was still in operation the Bulgarian authorities should continue to improve its safety.
