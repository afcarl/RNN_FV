PARIS 1996-12-06

The merger of Air France Europe into parent Air France will become effective on April 1 as planned, Air France chairman Christian Blanc said on Friday.

The full integration of the Air France Europe unit will give birth to a group which will then be called Groupe Air France, he said in a statement.

Air France Europe staff will keep their work contract on basic pay, qualifications and seniority but be subject to the Air France parent statues as far as the rest is concerned, the statement said.
