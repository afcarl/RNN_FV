Italy's Stet MD to quit after sell-off.

ROME 1996-12-06

Ernesto Pascale, managing director of Italian state telecommunications holding Stet, said he was ready to leave the company once it had been privatised, a magazine reported.

Pascale, in an interview with weekly Il Mondo released ahead of publication on Saturday, said he hoped privatisation would take place swiftly.

"As far as I'm concerned, with privatisation I can't do anything but say thank you and go. I take that for granted. Saying that, I add that I would like to see privatisation immediately," Pascale was quoted as saying.

Stet's privatisation has been repeatedly delayed. The group is now due to be sold off late in 1997 once it has merged with its operating arm Telecom Italia, a process which is expected to take around six months.
