EU official puts grain crop near 200 mln tonnes.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

The European Union's 1996 grain crop is closer to 200 million tonnes than the 203 million estimated by the trade, a European Commission grain official said on Friday.

"There's going to be an awful lot of grain going into intervention. That's what happens when you have a good harvest," said the official.

Favourable weather, high prices and an easing of planting restrictions resulted in a 15 percent surge in output.  

The Commission, fearful of creating market turmoil, has declined to issue official estimates, leaving it to trade and producer organisations to disclose a record crop.

Coceral, the EU grain trade lobby, raised its 1996 crop estimate by nearly two million tonnes to 203 million.

COPA, the EU farmers' lobby, last month put grain production in the 15 EU member states at 205 million tonnes.
