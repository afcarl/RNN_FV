France expels new planeload of Romanians.

PARIS 1996-12-06

France sent home 23 Romanian illegal immigrants on Friday, including four people recently released from prison, the interior ministry said.

The group was the 32nd of its type sent home by air since current Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre was appointed following the election of President Jacques Chirac in May 1995.

No details were given but in the past, virtually all those expelled have been members of that country's large poverty-stricken gypsy minority who have slipped into in France in increasing numbers in recent years.

Most expulsions from France by air of illegal immigrants have been to West and Central Africa or to Romania.

Nearly 20,000 illegals have been expelled since Debre took office including nearly 12,000 this year.

More than 1,000 people employing illegal immigrants, mostly in the garment trade, and a further 1,000 people who helped them slip into the country without passing border controls were arrested during the same period, the ministry said.

Illegal immigration has become a burning issue in France with unemployment at over 12 percent and the far-right National Front party gaining strength in by-elections with demands that jobs be reserved for "native-born" French people.
