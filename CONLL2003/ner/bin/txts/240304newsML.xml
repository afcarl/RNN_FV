<p>France sent home 23 Romanian illegal immigrants on Friday, including four people recently released from prison, the interior ministry said.</p>
<p>The group was the 32nd of its type sent home by air since current Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre was appointed following the election of President Jacques Chirac in May 1995.</p>
<p>No details were given but in the past, virtually all those expelled have been members of that country's large poverty-stricken gypsy minority who have slipped into in France in increasing numbers in recent years.</p>
<p>Most expulsions from France by air of illegal immigrants have been to West and Central Africa or to Romania.</p>
<p>Nearly 20,000 illegals have been expelled since Debre took office including nearly 12,000 this year.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 people employing illegal immigrants, mostly in the garment trade, and a further 1,000 people who helped them slip into the country without passing border controls were arrested during the same period, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration has become a burning issue in France with unemployment at over 12 percent and the far-right National Front party gaining strength in by-elections with demands that jobs be reserved for &quot;native-born&quot; French people.</p>
