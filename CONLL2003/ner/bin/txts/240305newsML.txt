Munksjo, Sodra expect pulp prices hikes on Monday.

STOCKHOLM 1996-12-06

Swedish forestry groups Munksjo AB and Sodra Skogsagarna expect to be able to raise bleached softwood pulp prices by $50 a tonne on Monday, the companies told Reuters on Friday.

"Stone Container in the U.S. announced that they will raise prices by 50 dollars and more U.S. companies are on their way to increase prices," said the president of Munksjo pulp mill Aspa Bruk, Bengt Unander-Scharin.

"It is likely that we will follow with a similar increase," he said.

Sodra's head of marketing, Hans Burmeister, said Sodra is also likely to raise prices on Monday.

The hike will bring pulp prices to between 610 and 620 dollars a tonne, Unander-Scharin said, adding that he thinks the price increase comes too early.

"I think this is one week too early," he said. "I would have liked to have first seen inventory levels for November, which will be released next week."

But if this price increase is accepted by buyers, Unander-Scharin expects more to follow.

"If this hike is seen through, there will probably be a certain momentum," he said. "If it is not accepted, there is a certain risk for a decline in prices."

Many companies, including Sodra, are losing money at current price levels.
