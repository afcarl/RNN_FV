Boutros-Ghali says cannot confirm Iraqi oil start.

UNITED NATIONS 1996-12-06

U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said Friday he could not confirm the start date for the Iraqi oil-for-food accord, saying he must wait for a report from inspectors before issuing clearance.

When asked if he could confirm statements from senior U.N. officials Friday that he would clear oil sales on Monday, Boutros-Ghali said, "No, I cannot confirm. Still I have not received the complete report of my experts (Saybolt inspectors in Iraq)."  

Dutch-firm Saybolt has yet to give its report to the secretary-general on the operational status of key oil metering equipment at the Zakho station along the Turkey-Iraq border. A previous Saybolt trip revealed faulty equipment.

Boutros-Ghali said he did not when he would receive the Saybolt report.

"When I receive it I will have a meeting and on the basis of this meeting we will decide (when the clearance for oil sales can be given)," said Boutros-Ghali.

A U.N. spokesman said earlier that the Saybolt report would be released later Friday.

When asked if he thought Monday was a likely date for issuing his own report, Boutros-Ghali said, "I don't know."

Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to sell $2 billion worth of crude over a six-month period in order to buy food and aid for civilians, suffering from sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990.
