<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>

<p>Dutch shares ended a traumatic Friday session well above the lows, first slumping on remarks overnight from Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, before rebounding sharply on better than expected U.S. jobs figures.</p>
<p>The AEX index closed 12.18 points or 1.94 percent lower at 616.26, battling back from an earlier 38.71 point drop to 589.73 as panic sellers scrambled to save profits from the rally which sent the AEX to its record high of 636.75 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been all over the place today,&quot; said one dealer, describing hectic trading conditions. &quot;I've seen clients earn and lose a fortune in just five minutes.&quot;  </p>
<p>Greenspan said the Fed must be wary of the potential damage to the economy when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; takes a grip of financial markets.</p>
<p>Analysts said this had raised fears that the Fed could believe that markets were overheating, with possible implications for a tightening of U.S. monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Quite a few people had assumed that the Fed would go lower. This speech diminishes the chances of a decline in the Fed funds rate,&quot; said Cees Rijsdijk, an economist at Suez Nederland. &quot;The Fed will not ease its monetary policy soon, that's the basic conclusion to be drawn,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>News U.S. non-farm payrolls rose 118,000 in November, much less than the expected 179,000 rise, helped soothe frayed nerves in a market which was already up from the day's lows on a feeling that the early fall was overdone.</p>
<p>Dealers also said the controlled early fall on Wall Street -- less than the anticipated 100 point fall by the time the Amsterdam market closed at 1530 GMT -- sent dealers home relatively satisfied on Friday, although Wall Street's close tonight would be key in setting Monday's tone.</p>
<p>&quot;If Wall Street holds its losses to less than 100 points tonight we could see some recovery,&quot; said another dealer.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the overall feeling on Friday was that Greenspan's remarks triggered a much-needed consolidation and that, although chart formations pointed to potential losses back to 550-560, the underlying bull market remained in place.</p>
<p>One chart analyst said today's fall fitted with a pattern of corrections seen late in 1995 and earlier this year when the market retreated only to recover strongly.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw the AEX go to 440 from 480 late last year and to 510 from 570 in the summer -- both of them very fast, steep corrections. This could be one of those as well,&quot; he said, adding all his charts showed rising patterns.  </p>
<p>One analyst expressed scepticism about the falls early in the session. He said Greenspan's remarks about &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in financial markets reminded him of the 1920s when people were borrowing money to put into stock markets.</p>
<p>&quot;He might be afraid of that but I'm not seeing it, nothing of the kind, it's not the way European or Dutch people are buying stocks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure we're going to have a shakeout but let all the panic sellers come, because I know some buyers. Those panic sellers around now are the same people who are going to buy back stock when the index is back around 625,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the market was showing classic signs of consolidation although fundamental factors, such as strong institutional liquidity and corporate moves to enhance shareholder value also pointed higher next year.</p>
<p>Losses in the AEX stretched to 9.3 guilders with Nutricia down that much to 248.20, reining back in an earlier 18 guilder drop. Royal Dutch was down 3.00 guilders to 285.30 after 274.50 guilders while Unilever closed 7.50 guilders down at 286.50.</p>
<p>Shares to keep falls under a guilder included KLM, down 60 cents to 46.70 guilders and ING down 40 cents to 58.90 guilders.</p>
