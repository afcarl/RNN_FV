Elf says Grandpuits crude runs to start in 2 days.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Elf Aquitaine said on Friday it could start partial output at its Grandpuits French refinery very quickly and start running crude in about two days, after workers lifted a strike at the plant.

Union officials said earlier workers at the 98,000 barrels per day Grandpuits refinery had voted to end a nine-day-old strike and two other plants were still voting on a pay offer.

An Elf spokesman said production of finished products could start "very quickly" at Grandpuits by using intermediary stocks.

Normal production which depends on crude inputs would start in about two days, he said.

Workers at Grandpuits near Paris voted on Friday afternoon to resume work at the next shift change, he said.

Grandpuits represents one fifth of Elf's total French refining capacity of 440,000 barrels per day which has been crippled by the strike.

The strike was originally sparked by plans to cut 330 jobs.
