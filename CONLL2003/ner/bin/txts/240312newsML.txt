China, Cuba to top EU-U.S. talks.

BRUSSELS, Belgium

The European Union agreed Friday to make trade with China and Beijing's future membership in the World Trade Organisation top issues at an upcoming summit in Washington, a European Commission official said.

European foreign ministers meeting in Brussels also said they would use the summit in Washington on Dec. 16 to reinforce the bloc's opposition to U.S. anti-Cuba legislation, the official said.

The official said the ministers had agreed that China's role in the WTO should be made part of the main discussion at the summit meeting of President Clinton, European Commission President Jacques Santer and Irish Prime Minister John Bruton, whose country is the current EU president.

"This is the highest-level discussion we will have had on China and the WTO," the official said.

China indicated in recent meetings with EU officials that it wants to renew its WTO membership drive. The EU wants to gauge America's attitude and perhaps to forge a common approach to Beijing.

In other issues at the U.S. summit, the EU is expected to emphasise progress made between the two sides over the past year, but also to raise issues of contention.

Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said the summit would focus on "the deeper relationship and address the irritations" between the two sides, the official said.

Chief among these is the Helms-Burton act, an amalgam of anti-Cuba legislation designed to bring Cuba to democracy.

The EU and many of Washington's other trading partners object to aspects of the legislation that threaten foreign companies doing certain types of business with Cuba.
