Swedish debt/currency market closing report.

STOCKHOLM 1996-12-06

Debt yields closed sharply up but off highs as the market tailed the international financial scare after a warning against "irrational exuberance" in asset markets by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

A weaker than expected November U.S. job report helped Swedish debt to recover from the worst levels.

"Today trading has been driven entirely by foreign factors," said one dealer.

Six-month T-bill rates closed two basis points higher at 4.10 percent and ten-year bond yields rose twelve basis points to 7.04 percent after hitting 7.10 percent in early trade.  

The crown tracked a weaker dollar. At 1515 GMT, the mark had firmed to 4.4035 crowns from 4.3800 crowns on Thursday.

Dealers hope that the focus will shift to Swedish fundamentals next week. "I don't see any room for a major rise in Swedish debt yields and I think next week's CPI figure will pave the way for lower yields," said one analyst.

Swedish November CPI figures, to be released on December 12, are expected to show a 0.1 percent drop in the month, taking the year-on-year figure down to deflation of 0.2 percent from deflation of 0.1 percent in October.
