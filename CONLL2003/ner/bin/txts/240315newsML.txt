Portugal's Communists warn on EMU.

OPORTO, Portugal 1996-12-06

Portugal's orthodox Communist Party lashed out on Friday at the minority Socialist government, saying its drive to join Europe's single currency would bring mounting economic sacrifices.

"The forced fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria will mean mounting sacrifices and difficulties, not just in 1997 but in 1998 and 1999," secretary-general Carlos Carvalhas told a special congress.

The Communists, who have 15 seats in the 230-seat parliament, have long opposed the government's plans to put Portugal in the vanguard of European Union countries uniting their economies in monetary union in 1999.

In order to qualify, Portugal must meet tough economic targets laid down in the Maastricht blueprint for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).

Carvalhas accused the Socialists of Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, whose party is four seats short of an outright majority in parliament, of following the same economic policies as its conservative predecessor, the Social Democrats.

The communist leader pledged to fight government attempts to keep a tight lid on wages in order to reduce inflation and contain the budget deficit -- both Maastricht targets.

A fresh round of public sector wage talks are due to be held on Monday with communist-led unions, which dominate the sector, threatening a strike if the government does not improve its 2.6 percent salary offer for next year.
