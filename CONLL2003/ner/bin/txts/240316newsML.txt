Norway shares plunge on Greenspan comments.

OSLO 1996-12-06

Norwegian shares, following other markets down, retreated on Friday and dealers said direction over the next few days was difficult to foresee.

Most bourses were trading lower in reaction to anti-inflation comments overnight by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

Oslo's Total share index plunged nearly three percent after the open but later came back after the release of U.S. payrolls data. The index closed 2.17 percent off at 929.18 points, with turnover a hefty 1.2 billion crowns.  

"Greenspan's comments have thrown a spanner into the works," said one dealer. "It's difficult to predict the next few days, maybe we'll recover, or maybe this will be the correction we've been waiting for."

Norwegian blue chip led the market down, industrial giant Norsk Hydro dropping 6.50 crowns to 327 crowns in bumper turnover of 249 million crowns.

Shipbuilding and engineeing company Kvaerner also fell heavily, the A stock losing 10 crowns to 276 crowns in 120 million crowns of business.
