<headline>Austria says bank sale unrelated to Creditanstalt.</headline>

<p>Austria said on Friday plans to put its stake in Bank Austria into the state-owned postal holding company were unrelated to an expected delay in receiving budgeted revenues from the sale of Creditanstalt-Bankverein.</p>
<p>A parliamentary committee earlier on Friday gave the green light to transferring a 17 percent stake in Austria's biggest bank to the postal holding in return for four to five billion schillings ($371-$464 million), with the aim of privatising it in the near future.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that's a very intelligent way of going about it,&quot; finance ministry spokesman David Mock told Reuters. &quot;We've been working on privatisation models for Bank Austria for some three or four months now. There's no connection to Creditanstalt.&quot;</p>
<p>Austrian media speculated that Finance Minister Viktor Klima was planning to make up for an expected shortfall of income due to the delay in realising revenues from the sale of a 70 percent stake in Creditanstalt by quickly selling his stake in Bank Austria.</p>
<p>&quot;This has nothing to do with budget tricks. It's about finding the best way of going about it,&quot; Mock said.</p>
<p>The postal holding company has committed itself to selling the stake to private investors sometime next year. Any extra profit from that sale will go to the government.</p>
<p>Klima has repeatedly said he wanted to wrap up the six-year-long privatisation of Creditanstalt this year, but has admitted he probably will not get the money -- an expected 10 billion schillings -- before the turn of the year.</p>
<p>The government has pencilled in a total of about 8.5 billion schillings in privatisation revenues this year.</p>
<p>Mock said transferring Bank Austria to the postal holding company, which also owns privatisation candidate PSK, the postal savings bank, would make sense because the company was led by two specialists with a record of successful sell-offs.</p>
<p>The holding is headed by Karl Hollweger and Erich Becker, who are also in charge of OeIAG, the government's industrial holding that has sold off large parts of Austria's formerly state-owned heavy industry.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes sense to give them another privatisation candidate,&quot; Mock said. &quot;After all, we're dealing with two privatisation professionals here.&quot;</p>
<p>The spokesman said a final decision about the timing of the sale of the Bank Austria stake, which represents 19 percent of the bank's voting capital, had not yet been taken.</p>
<p>The latest tender for the state's 70 percent voting stake in Creditanstalt, which has been on the government's sell-off list for more than six years, closes on December 16. -- Knut Engelmann, Vienna newsroom +431 53112 274 ($ = 10.77 Austrian Schillings)</p>
