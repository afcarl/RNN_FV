Workers vote to end strike at one Elf French plant.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Workers voted on Friday to end a strike at one out of three Elf Aquitaine French refineries which have been crippled by a nine-day-old protest over jobs, union officials said.

Workers voted to halt their action immediately at the Grandpuits refinery near Paris, as secret ballots on an end to the strike continued at two other refineries, the Feyzin plant near Lyon and Donges in western France, they said.  

"The workers here decided to end the action, so for us it's over," a CFDT union official at Grandpuits told Reuters after a meeting to decide whether to accept an Elf offer to improve pay and working conditions.

The 98,000 barrels per day (bpd) Grandpuits plant will start producing again at the weekend, he said.

Another union official at the same refinery said staff believed they had won some concessions from France's largest refinery but problems of cost-cutting and redundancies in the refining sector had not been resolved.

Grandpuits workers are regarded as less militant than those at other plants, especially Feyzin, union officials said earlier. A union source at Feyzin said before the Grandpuits decision that a packed meeting there was voting on whether to accept Elf's offer, but some strikers were ready to carry on.
