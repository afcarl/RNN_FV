FOCUS-French refinery strikers vote on Elf pay offer.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Strikers at Elf Aquitaine voted on Friday on whether to end an increasingly bitter dispute which has crippled three refineries for more than a week and is costing the French oil giant millions of dollars.

Elf said its French refinery workers would decide on Friday whether to accept its offer to improve pay and bring forward the retirement age for those who work unsocial hours.

But union leaders angrily rejected the offer and said the strike was about Elf's plans to cut 330 refinery jobs, not cash.

"We don't give a damn about salaries. That was not why we have had nine days of strike," a union official at the Feyzin refinery near Lyon told Reuters.

But another strike organiser at the Grandpuits refinery near Paris said workers there were starting to grow weary on day nine of the strike and might decide to call it a day.

"They are very disappointed (with Elf's offer) but they are getting fed up," he said.

Others accused Elf trying to buy an end to the strike.

Elf has rejected union calls to scrap plans to shed about a tenth of its French refinery workforce, but a spokesman said on Thursday that talks which led to the pay offer had gone well.

The industrial action has been partly inspired by concessions to striking truck drivers, who gained a cut in the retirement age to 55 from 60 for drivers with 25 years' experience. The truckers' 12-day strike ended a week ago.

Unions said Elf had offered to lower the retirement age to 56 or 57 for some shift workers, depending on their experience.

But this was a three-month improvement on the age already being considered and fell short of their demands, they said.

The strike at France's largest oil firm has blown a hole worth several million dollars a day in Elf's refinery earnings.

It has also forced it to buy thousands of tonnes of oil products from its rivals in order to keep its petrol stations and depots full, oil traders said.

The cost -- at least $20 million by some estimates -- may have been reduced by selling part of the crude oil Elf cannot refine to other oil firms who are running at full capacity.

Unions plan disruption across the French oil industry with a nationwide strike on December 10. But one union official said that strike call was intended partly to force Elf to negotiate.
