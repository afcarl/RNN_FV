<title>FRANCE: FOCUS-French refinery strikers vote on Elf pay offer.</title>
<headline>FOCUS-French refinery strikers vote on Elf pay offer.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Strikers at Elf Aquitaine voted on Friday on whether to end an increasingly bitter dispute which has crippled three refineries for more than a week and is costing the French oil giant millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Elf said its French refinery workers would decide on Friday whether to accept its offer to improve pay and bring forward the retirement age for those who work unsocial hours.</p>
<p>But union leaders angrily rejected the offer and said the strike was about Elf's plans to cut 330 refinery jobs, not cash.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't give a damn about salaries. That was not why we have had nine days of strike,&quot; a union official at the Feyzin refinery near Lyon told Reuters.</p>
<p>But another strike organiser at the Grandpuits refinery near Paris said workers there were starting to grow weary on day nine of the strike and might decide to call it a day.</p>
<p>&quot;They are very disappointed (with Elf's offer) but they are getting fed up,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Others accused Elf trying to buy an end to the strike.</p>
<p>Elf has rejected union calls to scrap plans to shed about a tenth of its French refinery workforce, but a spokesman said on Thursday that talks which led to the pay offer had gone well.</p>
<p>The industrial action has been partly inspired by concessions to striking truck drivers, who gained a cut in the retirement age to 55 from 60 for drivers with 25 years' experience. The truckers' 12-day strike ended a week ago.</p>
<p>Unions said Elf had offered to lower the retirement age to 56 or 57 for some shift workers, depending on their experience.</p>
<p>But this was a three-month improvement on the age already being considered and fell short of their demands, they said.</p>
<p>The strike at France's largest oil firm has blown a hole worth several million dollars a day in Elf's refinery earnings.</p>
<p>It has also forced it to buy thousands of tonnes of oil products from its rivals in order to keep its petrol stations and depots full, oil traders said.</p>
<p>The cost -- at least $20 million by some estimates -- may have been reduced by selling part of the crude oil Elf cannot refine to other oil firms who are running at full capacity.</p>
<p>Unions plan disruption across the French oil industry with a nationwide strike on December 10. But one union official said that strike call was intended partly to force Elf to negotiate.</p>
