Elf can refine in two days once French strike ends.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Elf Aquitaine will need about two days to restore output at its crippled French oil refineries once workers decide to call off their strike, now in its ninth day, union and management sources estimated on Friday.

Workers at all three domestic French refineries run by Elf are on strike over plans to cut jobs but are scheduled to vote later on Friday on whether to end the stoppage.

The plants have been left in a near-ready state with hot gas flowing through the loops of pipes and a refinery's trademark gas flares still burning off from the roof, the sources said.

"From the outside you couldn't tell there was a strike. The refinery could start up in maybe two days," a union official said at the Feyzin refinery on the main highway near Lyon.

A management official said the plants were still hot with gas, meaning they could quickly be flushed and restarted.

The length of time it would take to return to normal is important for oil markets which must make up some 100,000 barrels of gasoline for every day the strike goes on.

Other products are also affected, while Elf has been forced to divert or sell crude it cannnot refine, oil traders say.

France's largest refinery at Donges, with a capacity of 210,000 barrels per day, is one of three idle plants which together represent a quarter of French capacity.

Unions say the degree of plant readiness and the staffing required to keep the refineries safe have both caused wrangling with Elf managers during the dispute.

One union official, who asked not to be named, said managers at one plant had threatened to allow it to run cold, meaning it would take up to two weeks for work to get back to normal.

There was no sign of this happening, however, and the suggestion could not be confirmed with Elf management.

Unions and local bosses have however compromised over the number of strikers to be kept on full pay to supervise the plants, union representatives said.

In one sign of life returning to normal, workers at Donges and Grandpuits allowed some oil products out of refinery storage from Thursday but unions said workers at Feyzin refused.

Limited deliveries had been agreed for as a gesture as long as negotiations lasted.

Elf put forward proposals on pay, bonuses and early retirement on Thursday but unions called them inadequate or irrelevant to their main grievances over job cuts.

Strikers vote on the Elf offer from 1300 GMT on Friday.

Elf said on Thursday that negotiations had gone well and unions would consult their members on whether to return to work.
