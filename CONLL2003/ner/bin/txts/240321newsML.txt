Monetary policy can't prop up growth-Buba official.

DUESSELDORF, Germany 1996-12-06

Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen said on Friday that he sees no need for monetary policy to prop up economic growth.

But at the same time, Jochimsen, who is also the president of the state central bank in North-Rhine Westphalia, told a news conference the German economy is not on solid base for sustained growth.

Asked it he saw any need for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth Jochimsen said, "No. Capital market rates are already at a historic low. We have no lack of liquidity in the German economy."  

Jochimsen also said economic growth currently had two sources, increasing exports and public consumption.

"The growth is partly deficit financed," he said, noting increases in pension and health insurance contributions had helped public consumption growth.

"That is not a foundation for growth," he said. "That is not an omen that makes self-sustaining growth or job creation possible."

The Bundesbank on Thursday, as expected, left its three main interest rates unchanged at its bi-weekly policy-setting council meeting.
