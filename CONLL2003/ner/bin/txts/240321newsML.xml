<p>Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen said on Friday that he sees no need for monetary policy to prop up economic growth.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Jochimsen, who is also the president of the state central bank in North-Rhine Westphalia, told a news conference the German economy is not on solid base for sustained growth.</p>
<p>Asked it he saw any need for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth Jochimsen said, &quot;No. Capital market rates are already at a historic low. We have no lack of liquidity in the German economy.&quot;  </p>
<p>Jochimsen also said economic growth currently had two sources, increasing exports and public consumption.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth is partly deficit financed,&quot; he said, noting increases in pension and health insurance contributions had helped public consumption growth.</p>
<p>&quot;That is not a foundation for growth,&quot; he said. &quot;That is not an omen that makes self-sustaining growth or job creation possible.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bundesbank on Thursday, as expected, left its three main interest rates unchanged at its bi-weekly policy-setting council meeting.</p>
