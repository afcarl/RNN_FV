A powerful cyclone hit India's southeast coast on Friday but then began to weaken, meteorologists said.

They said the storm had crossed into the southern state of Tamil Nadu, about 50 km (miles) south of its capital, Madras.

"The cyclone has been progressively weakening," said S.K. Subramaniam, head of the Cyclone warning centre at Madras.

He said the cyclone's intensity had also reduced with a fall in the wind speed to 100 kph (60 mph) from 120 km (75 mph).

"A severe cyclonic storm has now turned into a cyclonic storm," Subramaniam said. "The sky should clear by evening tomorrow."

The cyclone had earlier threatened to cross land near the port town of Machilipatnam in Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday. But it moved southwards and weakened by Thursday, while retaining its potential for destruction.

A senior official in Nellore town in Andhra Pradesh said the cyclone had almost skipped the state.

"It has moved away from Nellore. There's not much wind here," said Sambasiva Rao, administrator of the district adjoining Tamil Nadu.

"We experienced winds of only 25 kph (15 mph)," Rao said. "But we may have intermittent rains tonight and tomorrow."

Earlier officials said the cyclone could inflict heavy damage. India's rocket launching centre at Sriharikota, near Nellore, could fall within the cyclone's path, they said.

Airport authorities in Madras said that most evening flights to and from the city had been cancelled.

Last month at least 2,000 people were killed and are missing after a storm swept through the East and West Godavari districts.
