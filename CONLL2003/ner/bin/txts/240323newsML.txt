Eight labourers were injured when they were trapped under a building which collapsed in western India on Friday, police said.

The Press Trust of India (PTI) earlier said that at least 40 workers were believed trapped in the building which was under construction when it collapsed in the town of Surat in Gujarat state.

"No one was killed. Eight people were pulled out of the debris," R.P. Choudhury, a police official at Surat's police control room, told Reuters by telephone.

"They have been sent to a hospital for treatment," Choudhury said. "They have got minor injuries".

He added that there were no more people trapped in the rubble.
