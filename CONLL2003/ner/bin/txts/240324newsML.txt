A powerful cyclone, whipping up winds of 80-100 kph (50-65 mph), began crossing India's southeast coast and could inflict heavy damage, officials said.

"The cyclone has begun crossing land and will completely cross the coast by midnight tonight," said J.V.M. Naidu, director of the cyclone warning centre at the port town of Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh.

Naidu told Reuters by telephone that the storm, located around 70 km (44 miles) north off Madras, could reach wind speeds of up to 120 kmph (75 mph) over land.

He said India's rocket launching centre at Sriharikota, near Nellore, could fall within the cyclone's path.

Meteorologists in Madras said the cyclone covered a stretch of 200 km (125 miles) between Nellore town in Andhra Pradesh state and Madras city in neighbouring Tamil Nadu state.

Authorities at Madras port hoisted "Signal 8", indicating a severe cyclone warning.

Officials said the potential for the cyclone to cause damage continued to be high despite the fact the storm had weakened since Thursday morning.

"There is no problem so far," said a civic official in Madras. "But we are ready to meet any eventuality."

He said 100 shelters had been set up across the city able to accommodate thousands of people from low-lying areas if they hav to be evacuted.

"Heavy to very heavy rains with flooding are expected all along the coast up to Pondicherry (adjoining Tamil Nadu) in the next 24 hours," reported a weather forecast issued in Madras.

Airport authorities in Madras said that most evening flights to and from the city had been cancelled.

The cyclone, which threatened to hit Andhra Pradesh near its port town of Machilipatnam on Wednesday, weakened as it moved south towards Tamil Nadu, its wind speed falling to 90-120 kmph (56-75 mph) from 150-180 (94-113 mph).

"Even at a reduced speed, the cyclone has tremendous destructive potential," Naidu had said on Thursday evening. "Winds of 100 kph (65 mph) are more than enough to bring down cables, trees and thatched houses."

Last month at least 2,000 people were killed and are missing after a storm swept through the East and West Godavari districts of the fertile state.
