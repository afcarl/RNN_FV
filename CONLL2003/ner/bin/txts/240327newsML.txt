Indian shares finish mixed in listless trade.

BOMBAY 1996-12-06

Indian shares ended mixed in dull, rangebound trade on Friday as most investors stayed on the sidelines, traders said.

"Trading was pretty dull...There was no wild movement seen in pivotals," said trader Purvesh Shah at Nucleus Securities, a domestic brokerage firm.

"Some buying by local funds was noticed today."

The market was awaiting some government measures to boost gloomy bourses. The Economic Times newspaper had said on Thursday finance ministry officials would meet to review market conditions.  

After market hours, a finance ministry statement said India had simplified the procedure which small and medium-sized firms must follow to make external commercial borrowings. It said approval now would only be needed from the central bank.

But the finance ministry did not make any market-moving announcements.

Market participants said local funds were select buyers in pivotal stocks on Friday, the last day of the current account on the Bombay bourse.  

In Delhi, shares ended slightly lower with the benchmark stocks index falling 1.10 points to 635.79.

"It seems that the major players were reluctant to create any large positions at this juncture and preferred to book profits at every rise," said Kuldip Sethi at brokers Multiple Investments.
