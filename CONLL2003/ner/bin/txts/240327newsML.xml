<p>Indian shares ended mixed in dull, rangebound trade on Friday as most investors stayed on the sidelines, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading was pretty dull...There was no wild movement seen in pivotals,&quot; said trader Purvesh Shah at Nucleus Securities, a domestic brokerage firm.</p>
<p>&quot;Some buying by local funds was noticed today.&quot;</p>
<p>The market was awaiting some government measures to boost gloomy bourses. The Economic Times newspaper had said on Thursday finance ministry officials would meet to review market conditions.  </p>
<p>After market hours, a finance ministry statement said India had simplified the procedure which small and medium-sized firms must follow to make external commercial borrowings. It said approval now would only be needed from the central bank.</p>
<p>But the finance ministry did not make any market-moving announcements.</p>
<p>Market participants said local funds were select buyers in pivotal stocks on Friday, the last day of the current account on the Bombay bourse.  </p>
<p>In Delhi, shares ended slightly lower with the benchmark stocks index falling 1.10 points to 635.79.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that the major players were reluctant to create any large positions at this juncture and preferred to book profits at every rise,&quot; said Kuldip Sethi at brokers Multiple Investments.</p>
