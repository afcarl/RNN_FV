Mother Teresa won't go home soon, doctors say.

Mother Teresa will not return home as hoped this weekend and has little chance of resuming work in the immediate future, doctors treating the 86-year-old nun said on Friday.

"That's out of the question," A.K. Chatterjee, administrator of the B.M. Birla Heart Research Centre where the missionary had heart surgery last week, said when asked if she was well enough to go home at the weekend.

Mother Teresa had surgery on November 29 to clear two blocked coronary arteries, her third such operation in five years.

But an irregular heartbeat, bronchial pneumonia, and long-standing kidney and lung problems complicated her recovery.

Mother Teresa had said she was keen to return to her work with the poor, the sick and the terminally ill which has earned her the title the "Saint of the Gutters".

Earlier one of the doctors treating the Roman Catholic nun had said she might be released by the weekend if she kept up the pace of her recovery.

"I'm absolutely fine," Chatterjee quoted her as saying on Thursday. "Tomorrow I think I'll go home."

But Chatterjee said she would stay at the specialist clinic. "This weekend is ruled out," he told reporters.

Clinic officials also ruled out any prospect of Mother Teresa returning to work soon.

"Unless the doctors are absolutely certain that her improvement has stabilised, and all her parameters are showing signs of stability, and are convinced that if Mother goes home nothing will recur, we will not release her," Chatterjee said.

The panel of doctors treating the 1979 Nobel peace prize winner said she was "very alert and cheerful this morning".

"Her condition shows signs of slight improvement but (is) not fully stable," they said in a regular update on her condition.

"Everything is all right. I bless you," he quoted Mother Teresa as saying when he met her briefly on Friday.

Mother Teresa's irregular heartbeat and lung congestion were still a problem, but her kidneys had improved, they said.

"Her appetite has been better today and she walked again a few steps looking a little stronger," the medical bulletin added.

Mother Teresa had some shredded chicken, chicken soup, toast, papaya and sandesh, a milk-based sweet, at lunch, Chatterjee said.

"She walked a distance of about 40 feet (12 metres)," he added. "She was supported by two nurses. She walks a little distance, stops, rests a little, then goes on again."

Mother Teresa also met 40 of the order's new trainees, who had taken their first vows, and blessed them, Chatterjee said.

Her Missionaries of Charity religious order that she founded has 4,500 nuns running 456 charitable homes in 111 countries.
