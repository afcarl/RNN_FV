<p>Hindu nationalists forced adjournment of India's lower house of parliament on Friday, in protest against a proposal to observe a minute's silence over the destruction of a mosque by a Hindu mob in 1992.</p>
<p>Members of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) shouted pro-Hindu slogans in the house after a communist deputy made the proposal in remembrance of the Babri mosque, which was razed on December 6, 1992.</p>
<p>The house was first adjourned for two hours. When it reconvened, BJP deputies resumed the slogan-shouting, and deputy speaker Suraj Bhan suspended work until Monday.</p>
<p>The destruction of the 16th-century mosque in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya triggered nationwide Hindu-Moslem violence in which more than 3,000 people were killed.</p>
<p>Indian officials blame revenge-minded Moslem underworld gangs in Bombay for a string of bombings in the city three months later that killed 260 people.</p>
<p>The BJP backs a hardline Hindu campaign to build a temple at the site of the mosque, which Hindus believe was the birthplace of the Lord Rama. The campaign catapulted BJP from the political fringe to become India's main opposition party in 1991.</p>
