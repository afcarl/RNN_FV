<p>Blue-chip stocks closed a shade higher in lacklustre trade at Bombay bourses on Friday on lack of market-moving news, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading was pretty dull...There was no wild movement seen in pivotals,&quot; said trader Purvesh Shah at Nucleus Securities, a domestic brokerage firm.</p>
<p>&quot;Some buying by local funds was noticed today.&quot;</p>
<p>The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) 30-share index rose 14.63 points, or 0.52 percent to end at 2,826.85, off the day's high of 2,841.80.  </p>
<p>Players said they were hopeful of the government announcing some measures shortly to boost the sagging bourses.</p>
<p>Top level finance ministry officials were likely to meet heads of major domestic financial institutions in New Delhi on Friday to &quot;review the prevailing sluggish market conditions,&quot; the Economic Times newspaper reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Government officials were not immediately available for comment on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders said speculators had changed their bearish views on the market in the short-run aided by the unconfirmed reports.</p>
<p>&quot;That may be the reason why prices were firm,&quot; Shah said.  </p>
<p>Market participants said local funds were select buyers in pivotal stocks on Friday, the last day of trade settlement at the BSE.</p>
<p>The 50-stock National Stock Exchange (NSE) index climbed 7.45 points, or 0.93 percent to close at a provisional 809.45.</p>
<p>Reliance was up 0.50 rupees to 184.0 rupees, TISCO 0.75 to 152.75, ITC 5.0 to 276.0, MTNL 1.50 to 216.0, ACC 9.0 to 954.0, Hind Lever 19.20 to 790.0 and TELCO 3.50 to 314.50.</p>
<p>Shares of SBI fell 0.75 rupees to 210.0, Gujarat Ambuja Cement 4.0 to 208.0 and BSES 0.25 to 186.0.</p>
