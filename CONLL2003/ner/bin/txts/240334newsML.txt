Consumer nations hope high oil price will melt in Goan sun.

Oil consuming nations are arriving in this resort region to resume a dialogue with OPEC and other oil producers on Saturday, hoping that crude prices now running at six-year highs are just a temporary blip.

The world's major industrialised energy importers for the most part have shrugged off this year's sharp rise in crude oil prices, which are nearing their highest levels since the Gulf War.

Inflationary pressures so far have not been triggered. But if prices don't deflate, that could change.

"Nobody seems to believe this is anything but a blip on the charts and that if they close their eyes it will go away and oil will be cheap again," said Peter Gignoux, energy analyst at brokerage Smith Barney in London. "I think they're mistaken."

For emerging countries with large energy deficits, like Goan energy conference hosts India, the price issue is already becoming increasingly painful as import bills swell.

Anxious to ensure a steady and plentiful supply of energy to sustain booming economic growth, India and other consuming nations will be hoping for a quick reversal in oil prices.

North Sea Brent crude approached its mid-October, post-Gulf War high of US$25.06 a barrel this week, about $8 higher than the last consumer-producer meeting in Venezuela in 1996.

Price stability, the mantra of four previous consumer-producer meetings, initiated in the wake of the 1990-1991 Gulf War oil price scare, will no doubt be re-emphasised in Goa.

But while producers want high, stable prices, consumers are looking for stability at cheaper levels.

OPEC producers, represented in Goa by six ministers and officials from four of its five other members, are increasingly confident that Brent prices can be sustained around $20-$25.

"These prices are here to stay," said a senior official from a Middle East OPEC country after arriving on Thursday.

"Of course oil producers hope prices will stay up," responded state Indian Oil Corp chairman R.K. Narang. "All producing countries would like prices to stay high and all consuming countries would like prices to drop."

High prices certainly don't appear to have hit demand yet, with world oil consumption set to grow next year by another 1.9 million barrels a day (bpd) to 73.7 million bpd, according to International Energy Agency (IEA) projections.

Demand this year has outstripped even the most ambitious oil producers' projections and the market is now heading into the peak demand northern winter.

Even the partial resumption of Iraqi exports, expected to begin soon under a U.N. oil-for-food deal, may not provide much relief for oil consumers.

"It's simply making no difference to the price," said Smith Barney's Gignoux.

The poor turn out in Goa from industrialised energy users indicates the low priority attached by many consumers to the talks, despite rising crude prices.

"For most countries, consumers have hardly registered the blip in crude prices," said Geoff Pyne, energy analyst at Swiss bank UBS. "Taxes are for more important than the underlying oil price."

Taxes make up about 75 per cent of the price of gasoline for many western consumers, an issue that OPEC producers again will be keen to raise.

But western governments have increased their tax take since the first round of discussions in Paris in 1991 and show little inclination to alter tax regimes in favour of the producers.

Pyne says current price levels are probably warranted given the slump in real oil values, stripping out inflation, in the decade from 1986.

"Oil prices are only just high enough for these producers to start paying back debt," said Pyne at UBS. "In any ordinary year these countries are still very much strapped for cash."
