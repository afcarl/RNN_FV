<p>			 TOP STORIES</p>
<p>The Hindustan Times</p>
<p>PRESIDENT'S RULE IN UTTAR PRADESH APPROVED</p>
<p>Both houses ofpParliament approved the re-imposition of President's rule in Uttar Pradesh (UP), despite opposition from the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena. Having failed in their bid to block the approval being passed, the BJP and the Shiv Sena walked out of both the Houses. The Lower House saw a battle of words ensue as the Congress strongly backed the UP governor's move to put the state under central rule. The Samata Party and the BJP were seen demanding the deletion of Article 356 from the Constitution that enabled a governor to recommend central rule in the state under his/her rule.</p>

<p>BPL WITHDRAWS ITS ADR ISSUE</p>
<p>BPL Cellular Holdings (BPLCH) has withdrawn its much talked about $200 million initial public offering (IPO) for an American Depository Receipt (ADR) issue. BPLCH's IPO withdrawal was due to a poor market response. BPLCH had wanted to place 22.3 percent of its equity or 12.5 million shares at a price of $15 to $17 apiece. However, the investors found its properties overvalued, and insisted on 50 percent discounts on the offer price. BPLCH's ADR issue also suffered due to press reports hinting at the company's foreign partners parting ways with it and poor projection of the company's financial health by its auditors.</p>
<p>BANKS TO ADVANCE FIXED INTEREST LOANS TO CORPORATES</p>
<p>Corporates may source their working capital fund requirements from FCNR(B) deposits of banks at a fixed rate of interest, independent of the London Inter Bank Offer Rate (LIBOR). Top banking sources said banks flush with FCNR(B) deposits were currently working out a scheme through which foreign currency working capital loans could be advanced to corporates at a fixed rate of interest. Sources said, the banks argued they could advance loans at a fixed rate of interest as their liabilities were not linked to the LIBOR.</p>
<p>TELECOMMUNCATION REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO GET MORE POWERS</p>
<p>The Department of Telecommuncations (DoT) accepted the parliamentary standing committee's recommendations that DoT should be under the purview of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). Sources said the draft cabinet note prepared by DoT was in favour of giving more powers to the TRAI. DoT, however, did not accept the panel's recommendation that the TRAI should advice the government in the matter of grant of licences to determine the need and timing for introduction of any new service provider.</p>
<p>SAMSUNG TURNS EYES TO PETROCHEM, INSURANCE SECTORS</p>
<p>Samsung, the $87 billion South Korean electronics giant, is firming up its plans for India, turning its eyes to several sectors including petrochemicals, insurance and finance. The South Korean major entered the country last year through its joint venture (JV) company Samsung India Electronics India Ltd. Samsung has tied up with Videocon to set up a 45 billion rupee JV naphtha cracker project. In the insurance and finance sectors, Samsung has started conducting feasibility studies.</p>
<p>ANITI-DUMPING DUTIES TO BE IMPOSED ON U.S. PETRO-GOODS</p>
<p>Following pleas from the domestic petrochemical industry, the government may impose hefty anti-dumping duties on imports of intermediate petrochemical products from the U.S. and Thailand. Sources said the move to prevent dumping of petrochemical products was being spearheaded by public sector petrochemical major Indian Petrochemicals Corporations Ltd (IPCL). The Union industry ministry is learnt to be seriously considering IPCL's demand in this regard.  </p>
<p>THREE-POINT FORMULA TO CONTAIN FISCAL DEFICIT PROPOSED</p>
<p>Finance minister P. Chidambaram has suggested a three-prong strategy to trim the fiscal deficit. He called for broadening the tax base to increase revenue mobilisation, reducing government expenditure and raising public sector savings. The government could not infinitely bear the burden of the fiscal deficit, he said. Funding public consumption through borrowings led to a steep rise in interest burden. Unbridled monetisation could lead to inflationary pressures and a high interest regime, he warned and called for measures to peg fiscal deficit at four percent by the year 2000.</p>

<p>NO TO HIKE IN BANK CROSS-HOLDINGS</p>
<p>The finance ministry has expressed unhappiness with the prospect of public sector banks developing cross-holdings among themselves. With this in mind, the central bank (RBI) has decided not to allow banks to pick up equity shares in other state-run banks in excess of the stipulated limit of five percent of their incremental deposits recorded in the previous year. The RBI's rigid stance may hit the forthcoming bank issues. Public sector banks were lobbying with the RBI for a waiver of the stipulation, as otherwise it would be difficult for them to raise necessary resources. Four public sector banks plan to raise about 20 billion rupees in the next three to four months.</p>

<p>The Observer</p>
<p>DILUTION IN MINIMUM ALTERNATE TAX RULED OUT</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram has ruled out any dilution of the minimum alternate tax (MAT) levied through the Union Budget 1996/97 (April-March). Referring to the various pleas put forward by the corporate sector, he said the introduction of MAT was part of the government's efforts at widening the tax net. If the profit making corporates could distribute their profits among the shareholders offering high rates of dividends, there was little reason as to why they could not pay 12.5 percent of their profits to the exchequer, he added.</p>
<p>CORPORATE GIANTS GIVE PRIORITY TO INVESTMENT IN POWER SECTOR</p>
<p>The top 20 Indian corporate sector companies have focused on energy generation as their top priority during the next five years' financial investment programme. The companies include groups such as the Tatas, Birlas, Reliance, Larsen &amp; Toubro, Mafatlal, Bajaj, RPG, Hindujas, Mittals and Jindal. The total investment by the top 20 Indian companies altogether in energy sector during the next five years is expected to be in the vicinity of 700 billion rupees. The Department of Company Affairs sources said this could be expected to generate about 21,000 megawatts.</p>
<p>BMW FIRM ON STALLING PROJECT OVER INDIGENISATION ISSUE</p>
<p>The German automobile major BMW reiterated that it would not invest in the car project in the country unless the government changed its policy on indigenisation. BMW, which had earlier planned to start production in 1996, recently decided to delay the automobile project rather than take a big investment decision at this point of time. Sources said the German major had sought permission from the government for importing most of the automobile components, while keeping the localisation programme to the minimum. The industry ministry sources, however, said the government was not likely to concede to the BMW's request.</p>
<p>BOMBAY BOURSE INDEX UP BY 67 POINTS</p>
<p>Short covering by bear operators coupled with small purchases by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) led to a 67.16 points rise in the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) sensitive index. The BSE sensitive index went to a high 2822.50 points against its last close of 2845.06 to end the day at 2812.22 points. Dealers said activity on the BSE was mainly in pivotals such as Tata Iron and Steel, Reliance, State Bank of India, Tata Electric Locomotive and ITC Ltd. The 50-share National Stock Exchange index closed at 802.23, gaining 14.08 points.</p>

<p>INSURANCE WATCHDOG BILL IN THIS SESSION</p>
<p>Despite opposition from the Left parties, the government is determined to bring a bill in this session of Parliament to set-up the Insurance Regularity Authority. The authority will screen applications from foreign and domestic private sector companies and sanction approval for their participation in the Indian insurance sector. Disclosing this, government sources said the law ministry had already approved the Bill and sent it back to the finance ministry.</p>
