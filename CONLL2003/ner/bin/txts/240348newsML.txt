HYDERABAD, India 1996-12-06

One person was killed and three were injured when police fired at Moslems in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad protesting over the destruction of a mosque by a Hindu mob in 1992, state officials said on Friday.

Police said they opened fire on the protesters after the rally marking the December 6 anniversary of the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque turned violent.

"One person was killed and three injured in the firing," N. Chandrababu Naidu, chief minister of Andhra Pradesh state, told a news conference.

Police said demonstrators in Hyderabad, a Moslem state in pre-independence India, set fire to 10 scooters and four cars.

The destruction of the 16th century mosque in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya in1992 triggered nationwide Hindu-Moslem violence in which more than 3,000 people were killed.

Earlier on Friday, Hindu nationalists forced adjournment of Indian parliament's lower house in New Delhi, protesting against a proposal to observe a minute's silence over the destruction of the mosque.

Members of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) shouted pro-Hindu slogans in the house after a communist deputy proposed the silent gesture in remembrance of the Babri mosque.

The house was first adjourned for two hours. When it reconvened, BJP deputies resumed the slogan-shouting, and deputy speaker Suraj Bhan suspending work until Monday.

The BJP backs a hardline Hindu campaign to build a temple on the site of the mosque, which Hindus believe was the birthplace of their deity, Lord Rama. The campaign catapulted BJP from the political fringe to become India's main opposition party in 1991.
