BOMBAY 1996-12-06

The impression that Industrial Credit and Investment Corp of India (ICICI)'s margins are under pressure is not accurate, an official of the term-lending bank said on Friday.

"Whereas the gross spread has improved marginally from 3.46 percent during 1995/96 to 3.49 percent for the half year ended September 30, 1996, the net spread decreased marginally from 2.93 percent to 2.91 percent during the above period," Kalpana Morparia, ICICI general manager, said in a statement.

"It may be noted that the level of non-performing assets as a percentage of net loan assets has marginally increased from 6.7 percent to 7.0 percent, and that too after giving effect to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) revised guidelines on recognition of non-performing assets..." it said.

ICICI has made complete disclosures of its non-performing assets as required under the RBI guidelines, it said.
