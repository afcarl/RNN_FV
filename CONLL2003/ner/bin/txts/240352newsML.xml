<p>South Africa said on Friday it would back former Tanzanian foreign minister and secretary general of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Salim A. Salim as candidate for the U.N. secretary-general's post.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has agreed to stand down. In that case we are backing Mr Salim as Africa's candidate for the job,&quot; South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki told Reuters in New Delhi. &quot;There is a consensus building up among the African countries on Salim's candidature,&quot; said Mbeki, who arrived on a six-day visit to India on Monday.</p>
<p>The United States, which opposes a second term for Boutros-Ghali, had vetoed Salim's bid for the U.N. top job before he stepped out of the race in 1981.</p>
<p>In a surprise move this week, Boutros-Ghali suspended &quot;temporarily&quot; his candidacy for another five-year term, opening the door for other Africans to vie for his job.</p>
<p>But he insisted he was still in the race. &quot;I am asking (the Security Council) not to vote on my name until I will present my name,&quot; he told reporters late on Wednesday. His term expires on December 31.</p>
<p>&quot;We had, together with the rest of the African continent supported Boutros-Ghali to serve a second term,&quot; Mbeki told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;But a few days ago the current chairperson of the OAU ... issued an invitation to the African countries to say that African countries should propose an additional candidate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I have seen a little bit of the press today. I haven't had the time to pay attention to it. But it indicates that Boutros-Ghali has accepted that he stand down,&quot; Mbeki said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the event of that, our view is that current OAU secretary general Salim Ahmed Salim should go ahead as the African candidate.&quot;</p>
<p>Mbeki said South Africa viewed Salim as a &quot;very very good candidate.&quot;</p>
<p>Most Western diplomats have said Boutros-Ghali, the 74-year old Egyptian diplomat, appeared to be elegantly preparing the way for his withdrawal in light of a U.S. veto against his re-election, the first time a sitting secretary-general has been opposed for a second term.</p>
<p>So far no other candidate has been nominated to contest the election.</p>
<p>Diplomats from France and several African states, however, have insisted that Boutros-Ghali was firmly in the driver's seat and was just stepping aside for the moment to see how events evolved.</p>
<p>Other envoys have said he was keeping himself in reserve in case the process became deadlocked and the 185-seat General Assembly, which supports him, would have to step in.</p>
