INDORE, India 1996-12-06

Soybean prices firmed in local markets in India this week on poor crop arrivals as farmers held back stocks to sell later at better prices, traders said on Friday.

"Soybean prices have risen by at least 300-400 rupees per tonne within a week," said Dinesh Jadhav, a leading oilmeal trader in the central city of Indore, the hub of India's soybean processing industry.

"Soybean arrivals may further decrease next month as farmers are not very much interested to sell their produce," said Nandkishore Agrawal, another oilmeal trader.

Traders said soybean arrivals were around 10,000 tonnes per day compared to about 20,000 during the same period last year.

They said soybean was currently quoted at 10,300-10,700 rupees per tonne compared to 8,100-8,350 rupees a year ago.

In plant delivery conditions, soybean was quoted at 10,400-10,850 rupees per tonne against 8,350-8,550 rupees the previous year.

"Soybean prices may cross the mark of 11,000 (rupees per tonne) next month as traders are holding back stocks to get better prices," said Prakash Vohra, another leading oilmeal trader.

Indian soymeal export prices were currently quoted at $268-269 compared to $278-279 per tonne FAS last week. It was around $206-207 per tonne during the same period last year.
