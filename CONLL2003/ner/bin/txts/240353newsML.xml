<p>Soybean prices firmed in local markets in India this week on poor crop arrivals as farmers held back stocks to sell later at better prices, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Soybean prices have risen by at least 300-400 rupees per tonne within a week,&quot; said Dinesh Jadhav, a leading oilmeal trader in the central city of Indore, the hub of India's soybean processing industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Soybean arrivals may further decrease next month as farmers are not very much interested to sell their produce,&quot; said Nandkishore Agrawal, another oilmeal trader.</p>
<p>Traders said soybean arrivals were around 10,000 tonnes per day compared to about 20,000 during the same period last year.</p>
<p>They said soybean was currently quoted at 10,300-10,700 rupees per tonne compared to 8,100-8,350 rupees a year ago.</p>
<p>In plant delivery conditions, soybean was quoted at 10,400-10,850 rupees per tonne against 8,350-8,550 rupees the previous year.</p>
<p>&quot;Soybean prices may cross the mark of 11,000 (rupees per tonne) next month as traders are holding back stocks to get better prices,&quot; said Prakash Vohra, another leading oilmeal trader.</p>
<p>Indian soymeal export prices were currently quoted at $268-269 compared to $278-279 per tonne FAS last week. It was around $206-207 per tonne during the same period last year.</p>
