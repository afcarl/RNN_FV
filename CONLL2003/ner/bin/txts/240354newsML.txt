South Africa backs Tanzania's Salim for U.N. top job.

NEW DELHI 1996-12-06

South Africa said on Friday it would back former Tanzanian foreign minister and secretary general of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Salim A. Salim as candidate for the U.N. secretary-general's post.

"We believe that U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has agreed to stand down. In that case we are backing Mr Salim as Africa's candidate for the job," South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki told Reuters in New Delhi.  

"There is a consensus building up among the African countries on Salim's candidature," Mbeki said.

In a surprise move this week, Boutros-Ghali suspended "temporarily" his candidacy for another five-year term, opening the door for other Africans to vie for his job.

But he insisted he was still in the race. "I am asking (the Security Council) not to vote on my name until I will present my name," he told reporters late on Wednesday. His term expires on December 31.

Mbeki arrived on a six-day visit to India on Monday.
