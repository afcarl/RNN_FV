A British arms dealer accused of dropping weapons by parachute into a remote eastern region of India last year said on Friday he pleaded not guilty to sedition and conspiracy charges.

"I pleaded not guilty," Peter Bleach told reporters after emerging from a court in the eastern city of Calcutta.

The former British army officer and five Latvians were arrested last December 22, five days after a Russian AN-26 aircraft dropped the arms in West Bengal state.

Authorities recovered 224 AK-47 and AK-56 rifles with more than 17,000 rounds of ammunition, eight rocket launchers, 80 anti-tank grenades and seven 9mm pistols.

Authorities believe the weapons were destined for the Hindu religious cult Ananda Marg, whose headquarters are close to the site of the drop.

The crew later flew to Phuket island in Thailand and Madras in southeastern India before being forced by Indian Air Force fighters to land in Bombay, in the west, on December 22.

Bleach, who diplomats said served with the British army in Northern Ireland and later ran a defence sales business in Yorkshire, has said he was acting as the "inside man" for the British government in the arms drop. Britain denies the claim.

Diplomats have said Britain tipped off India before the arms drop. Home (Interior) Secretary Michael Howard said in January his government had supplied information to Indian authorities, which helped them arrest Bleach and the others.

Metropolitan magistrate Udayan Mukherjee said he would decide on Saturday when to commit Bleach and the Latvian crew to trial in the case. No reporters were allowed into the courtroom on Friday.

The accused face a maximum penalty of death by hanging if convicted, lawyers said.

The five Latvians, who have denied any wrongdoing, threatened to go on hunger strike unless the magistrate sets an early trial date.

"We have no choice but to begin an indefinite strike until an early trial date is fixed," the crew members said in a statement given to Reuters. "We have nothing to fear from a fair trial and we only ask the chance to state our case."
