Norwegian minister floats idea for energy forum.

GOA, India 1996-12-06

The current dialogue between oil producers and consumers should be used as a forum to evolve a global energy organisation on the lines of other groupings, Norwegian Energy Minister Grete Faremo said on Friday.

"There is a world food organisation, a trade organisation and a health organisation. But there isn't any global energy organisation," she told the fifth International Energy Conference being held in this Indian state.

"And there isn't even a reminiscence of a global energy policy," Faremo said.

The three day-meeting between oil consuming nations and major oil producers began in a resort hotel with supply security topping the agenda.

This is the fifth meeting between energy importing and exporting countries since the gatherings began in response to the oil price scares of the Gulf War.

Faremo said it was a paradox that such an organisation does not exist as energy permeated the very core of political, economic and environmental interest of countries.

"But we have the opportunity to do something about it. We can use this producer-consumer dialogue to put energy on the political agenda," She said.

Faremo said this meeting might be the right time to start a discussion on whether the energy dialogue could be developed further.

"I was putting in the idea for a dialogue knowing it will be a long process," she told reporters later.

Faremo hoped other delegations would address this point.

Faremo told the meeting more common ground could be found between the countries with emerging economies and the industrialised West, whether producers or consumers.

She said while security of supply was vital for the consuming countries, security of demand was equally important for the producers.

"This interdependence should form the basis for enhanced cooperation," she said.
