Indian gold, silver end higher on seasonal buying.

BOMBAY 1996-12-06

Gold and silver opened higher aided by a firm world trend and gained further by close on wedding season demand, dealers said.

"Landing costs of imported silver and gold have gone up due to higher world prices and a firm dollar," said a dealer.

"Limited arrivals of imported gold and some seculative buying have helped prices to come out of recent lows," he said. On Thursday gold was quiet.

Gold biscuit (116.50 grammes each) settled 200 rupees higher at 59,100 rupees.
