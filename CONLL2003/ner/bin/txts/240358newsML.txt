Shell Sri Lanka-union deal ensures gas supplies.

COLOMBO 1996-12-06

Shell Gas Lanka Ltd said on Friday it had struck a wage deal with workers in a move the company said would help maintain uninterrupted gas supplies for three years.

"We are now assured of three years of labour harmony," Shell Gas Lanka managing director Frank Van Den Akker said in a statement.  

The company rejected the All Ceylon Commercial and Industrial Workers Union's original package of demands worth 100 million rupees in the first year, Shell said.

But the two sides settled on a 24 million rupee, three year package that will see basic monthly salaries increase 700 rupees in each of the next three years, plus bonuses and other benefits, a company spokesman told Reuters.

Shell Gas Lanka, owned by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is the monopoly gas distributor in this Indian Ocean island of 18 million people.

The deal covers all the company's union workers.  

Workers staged a six-day strike in support of their demands last month, halting gas supplies and fuelling a two-day slide on the sharemarket that hit manufacturing stocks.

Van Den Akker said the agreement, negotiated with the guidance of Labour Minister Mahinda Rajapakse, also meant the union would not seek further wage rises during the life of the pact, not take industrial action over matters covered by the deal and would resolve any dispute through normal negotiations.  

"With the industrial dispute settled, Shell and its associated dealers are committed to continue the process of improving facilities, safety conditions and customer service standards throughout the island," Van Den Akker said.

Union officials were not immediately available for comment.
