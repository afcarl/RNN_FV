RESEARCH ALERT-Caspian says sell India SCICI, IFCI.

BOMBAY 1996-12-06

Caspian Securities said it recommended a "sell" on shares of Industrial Finance Corp of India (IFCI) and SCICI Ltd, two Indian term-lending banks.

"IFCI has the highest non-performing asset (NPA) level of all the Indian development financial institutions (DFIs)," Caspian said in a December research report.

Under a new chief executive who has totally revamped the management structure, IFCI has significantly accelerated its rate of asset growth, the report said.

"Nevertheless, although P/E (price earning) valuations seem attractive, both retail investors and the 'professional' market remain suspicious of IFCI's apparent transformation," it said.

SCICI Ltd is well capitalised, has low non-performing assets, high efficiency levels and good profitability ratios, Caspian said in a "sell" recommendation.

But its shares have consistently and significantly underperformed in the market, it said.

"We expect earnings to decline in 1996/97 (April-March) as the funds SCICI has raised thus far in FY97 have not been deployed profitably," the report said.

"Earnings in FY98 and FY99 are expected to recover but the rebound will likely be unimpressive," it added.
