<p>Norwegian energy minister Grete Faremo said her country has no plans to cut expenditures on future oil development despite inflationary pressures on Norway's booming economy caused by oil prices now running at six year highs.</p>
<p>&quot;That is not the policy of this government,&quot; she told reporters here on Friday after the official opening of the fifth international meeting of world oil producers and consumers.</p>
<p>Oil and gas expenditures in Norway are expected to total 51.5 billion crowns in 1997, up seven billion from 1996, the Norwegian government statistics office said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Faremo reiterated that Norway expects oil production to rise to 3.4 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2000 from about 3 million bpd this year and in 1997. It is also expected to produce a further 200,000 bpd of condensate.</p>
<p>She said she would be meeting British minister of state for trade Lord Fraser of Carmyllie during the Goa talks to discuss the long-running issue of the Anglo-Norwegian Frigg gas pipeline treaty.</p>
<p>The Frigg field straddles the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea and there are two pipelines running to a terminal in Scotland.</p>
<p>Under a treaty signed in 1976, Norway is only allowed to delivered gas produced from Frigg or from one of its satellites down the Norwegian line and the deal remains in force until Frigg is fully depleted.</p>
<p>But Frigg output has been falling since 1992 and the Norwegian line has been greatly underused. Norway wants to renegotiate the treaty to use the spare capacity to deliver gas from other fields but Britain has so far said no.</p>
