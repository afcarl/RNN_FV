India reaffirms commitment to oil price reforms.

GOA, India 1996-12-06

India is pressing ahead with phased price reforms for petroleum products and drawing up a new oil exploration licensing policy, Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda said on Friday.

"My government is actively considering proposals for price reforms in a phased manner," Deve Gowda said in his inaugural address to the fifth International Energy Conference, which brings together the world's oil consumers and producers.

India rationalised duties on oil products in its 1996/97 (April-March) general budget in an effort to prepare the country for possible price deregulation.

Finance Minister P. Chidambaram cut the import duty on crude oil to 25 percent from 35 percent.

India at the moment does not have free market pricing of petroleum products but it plans at some stage a transition to a decontrolled price regime.

Major products like gasoline, High Speed Diesel, kerosene, liquid petroleum gas (LPG), furnace oil and aviation turbine fuel are under a price administered category.

However, subsidising domestic prices below high world levels is becoming a major drag on India's economy.

Currently, India's crude oil production meets less than half of its annual demand of 81 million tonnes. The remainder must be imported at international prices.

India has already allowed parallel marketing of LPG and kerosene as a prelude to further deregulation of its oil markets, and oil companies are free to set prices of items like lube base oil and lubricants.

Deve Gowda, who also holds the oil minister portfolio, said India is also working on a new policy to encourage oil companies to find new supplies faster.

"A new exploration licensing policy is also on the anvil which will rationalise levies and ensure a level playing field among private companies and national oil companies," he said.

India allowed private participation in exploration of oil and gas as part of economic reforms that started in 1991.

Until now six medium-sized oil fields, 24 small-sized fields and 35 exploration blocks have been awarded under the policy of private participation involving a committed investment of $1.8 billion.

Proposals for 12 new oil refineries with an installed capacity of 79 MMTPA, involving an investment of over $10 billion, have also been cleared.

"We propose to build further on this foundation by working for the infusion of private capital and enterprise in this vital area even as the public sector units are reformed for greater efficiency," Deve Gowda said.

He said India, as a large consumer, was exploring opportunities for providing a market for the gigantic gas reserves available in the region.

He said the huge, fixed and irreversible investments required for harnessing this resource required large and stable markets, pipelines and transportation networks.

He predicted global demand for oil and gas would grow at a steady pace.

In India alone the demand for petroleum products is expected to grow by more than six percent per year, doubling from the current level of 75 million tonnes to 150 million tonnes in the year 2010, requiring $100 billion in additional investment.

Junior Petroleum Minister T.R. Balu said the government was considering reforms in the hydrocarbons sector to promote competition between the private and state-owned sector and provide cheaper sources of energy.

"Simultaneously, we are working on freeing our national oil companies from the procedural hurdles to take quick investment decisions," Balu said.
