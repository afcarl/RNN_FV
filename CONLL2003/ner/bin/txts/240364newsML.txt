India simplifies foreign borrowing procedure.

NEW DELHI 1996-12-06

The Indian government said on Friday it has simplified the procedure which small and medium-sized firms must follow to make external commercial borrowings by delegating approval authority to the central bank.

The Finance Ministry said in a statement that small and medium-sized firms wishing to avail themselves of the External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) scheme no longer needed approval from both the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

"In order to avoid this dual approval, as a measure of further simplification and deregulation for the benefit of corporates and institutions, government have now decided to delegate the sanctioning powers to RBI for the $3 million scheme," it said.

It said a separate cell was being set up in the RBI's central office in Bombay to process the applications.

The simplified procedure will take effect on December 15. Applications received in the ECB division of the Finance Ministry before December 15 will be processed in the ministry, it said.

The scheme permits corporations and institutions to raise ECB up to $3 million equivalent at a minimum maturity of three years.

A total of 324 loans amounting to $607.8 million were approved under the $3 million scheme between April 1 and November 30, it said.
