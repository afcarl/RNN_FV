A Nepali cabinet minister said on Friday he had resigned after being charged with corruption over fertiliser deals.

"I have resigned and sent in my resignation to his majesty," Agriculture Minister Padma Sundar Lawati told Reuters, referring to King Birendra. Lawati denied any wrongdoing.

Lawati stepped down one day after the official Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a graft case against him.

The CIAA, an independent agency, on Thursday charged Lawati and 11 other officials of abusing authority while clinching three contracts for the supply of fertiliser this year.

In a suit filed with an appeals court, the CIAA accused Lawati and the other officials of causing a loss of 68.6 million rupees ($1.2 million) to the exchequer.

The charges against Lawati carry a maximum penalty of five years in jail on conviction, lawyers said.

"The charges against me are baseless and have no truth in them," Lawati told Reuters after resigning. "I am innocent. I will put my views before the court fearlessly."

Agriculture Secretary Dan Bahadur Shahi and the general manager of the state-owned Agricultural Inputs Corporation (AIC), which arranged the deal, were also charged by the CIAA.

The 11 officials, apart from Lawati, face maximum jail terms of one to five years if convicted, lawyers said.

Lawati was a senior member of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's three-party coalition government. He is vice-president of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, which plays a power broker role in the 15-month-old, centre-right coalition that replaced a communist government last year.

Lawati accused one section of Deuba's Nepali Congress party of playing "conspiratorial politics" against him in view of local elections due in next year.

Deuba's Nepali Congress is the leading partner in the coalition government.
