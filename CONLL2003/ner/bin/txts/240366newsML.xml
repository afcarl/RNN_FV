<p>A Nepali cabinet minister said on Friday he had resigned after being charged with corruption over fertiliser deals.</p>
<p>&quot;I have resigned and sent in my resignation to his majesty,&quot; Agriculture Minister Padma Sundar Lawati told Reuters, referring to King Birendra. Lawati denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Lawati stepped down one day after the official Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a graft case against him.</p>
<p>The CIAA, an independent agency, on Thursday charged Lawati and 11 other officials of abusing authority while clinching three contracts for the supply of fertiliser this year.</p>
<p>In a suit filed with an appeals court, the CIAA accused Lawati and the other officials of causing a loss of 68.6 million rupees ($1.2 million) to the exchequer.</p>
<p>The charges against Lawati carry a maximum penalty of five years in jail on conviction, lawyers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The charges against me are baseless and have no truth in them,&quot; Lawati told Reuters after resigning. &quot;I am innocent. I will put my views before the court fearlessly.&quot;</p>
<p>Agriculture Secretary Dan Bahadur Shahi and the general manager of the state-owned Agricultural Inputs Corporation (AIC), which arranged the deal, were also charged by the CIAA.</p>
<p>The 11 officials, apart from Lawati, face maximum jail terms of one to five years if convicted, lawyers said.</p>
<p>Lawati was a senior member of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's three-party coalition government. He is vice-president of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, which plays a power broker role in the 15-month-old, centre-right coalition that replaced a communist government last year.</p>
<p>Lawati accused one section of Deuba's Nepali Congress party of playing &quot;conspiratorial politics&quot; against him in view of local elections due in next year.</p>
<p>Deuba's Nepali Congress is the leading partner in the coalition government.</p>
