Indian rupee ends up on shrinking dollar demand.

BOMBAY 1996-12-06

The Indian rupee ended at 35.780/795 per dollar on Friday, up from the day's opening level of 35.80/81, dealers said.

"The rupee rose on lack of (dollar) demand," said a dealer. A leading state-run bank, whose buying and selling moves the market, was not active on Friday, dealers said.

"His quotes indicated he had no specific interest today," said a dealer. "The market was quiet," said another dealer.

"Banks are getting used to sharp two-way movements," said a dealer, referring to rupee's fall to 35.86 earlier this week. Memories of one-way movement are still fresh, one dealer said, referring to the free fall of the rupee in February this year.

The rupee has recovered towards the close of trading after every sharp reversal in recent weaks.

"Until the rupee closes below 35.88, talk of rupee testing the 36 per dollar level seem to be premature," said a dealer.

Forward dollar premia were steady for most of the day but slipped marginally towards the close after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervened, dealers said.

June dollars opened the day at 1.50/1.53 rupees but fell by about three paise after RBI's intervention, dealers said.

The six-month annualised premium closed at 7.55 percent, down from the previous close of 7.60 percent.

"Forwards are edging to our this fortnight's target of 7.50 percent thanks to RBI's December/May rollover of swaps," a dealer at a European bank said earlier in a commentary.

"Though it goes well with falling interest rate scenario, banks will look to pay on dips in view of the bruised market sentiment," he said.
