Pakistan's fertiliser industry, expanding for the last 10 years, is expected to see more growth in revenue, profits and production, a recent research report by brokerage house James Capel Asia said.

"At present the industry is poised to experience growth in revenue in the future, fuelled by an increasing demand for fertiliser and rising prices," the report said.

It said the industry had grown impressively in the last 10 years, with output rising to more than 2.2 million tonnes in fiscal 1992/93 (July-June) from 1.203 million tonnes in 1982/83 due to demand, tax exemptions and the import of new machinery.

Pakistan produced a provisional 4.1 million tonnes of fertiliser in 1995/96 and imported 1.1 million tonnes from Germany, the United States, Norway, South Korea, The Netherlands, Belgium and Finland.

The production increase was largely due to combined capacity additions of 1.1 million tonnes in 1993 by Fauji Fertiliser Co Ltd (FFC) and Engro Chemicals Ltd.

Production is expected to grow by another 1.8 million tonnes in 1998 when two more plants of FFC and Al-Noor Fertiliser are due to come on line and Engro plans to increase its capacity.

Pakistan has a total of 10 fertiliser factories of which six are state-run. But the four private-sector plants dominate the industry, accounting for 62 percent of total production.

The report said private sector dominance would increase in future as the government plans to privatise state-owned Pak Saudi Fertiliser and other units.

"Given such a market structure, the level of competition is predictably low, which augurs well for the industry given the homogenous and quintessential nature of the product," it said.

The report said the industry would maintain long-term profitability because of low competition, high barriers to new entrants and growing demand. "However, together with this growth in demand is the constraint of limited supplies of the industry's most important input, natural gas," it said.

Pakistan's gas reserves, estimated at 21 trillion cubic feet, are expected to last only 30 years.

"With the absence of substantial new discoveries, the industry will have to rely on imported gas or alternate methods of production in the long-term.

"Expensive imported gas can squeeze margins, unless the government subsidises it to maintain the cost of fertiliser production," the report said.
