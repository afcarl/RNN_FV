<p>The owners of the 136-year-old O.L.M. Macan Markar Ltd jewellery company plan to sell their family jewels, including gold and wedding heirlooms dating back to the 17th century, for $1 million.</p>
<p>On display at the family's shop in downtown Colombo is the collection of antique Moorish bridal jewellery dating back to the 17th century, first owned by Mrs. O.L.M. Macan Markar.</p>
<p>The grandchildren of one of the Indian Ocean island's illustrious pre-Independence Moslem leaders announced the sale.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the pieces came as gifts from relatives and friends in India. The collection has been amassed by my family during a period of over a century,&quot; Mohamed Macan Markar, one of the heir's many grandchildren, told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>The jewels, worn only by the original owner's seven daughters at their weddings and by their daughters at their weddings, includes necklaces, bracelets, rings, brooches and many other items. All are made of 15 carat gold and are studded with rubies, emeralds, natural pearls and diamonds.</p>
<p>The two centrepieces of the collection are a gem-studded gold crescent weighing 8.4 ounces (260 grams) and a seven-row gold necklace studded with 276 rubies and 82 emeralds weighing 18 ounces (560 grams).  </p>
<p>So why does the family want to part with this treasure trove?</p>
<p>&quot;Now the fourth generation of Macan Markars are about to take charge of the family business. And we're all a little tired of guarding the collection. We want to find it a good new home,&quot; said Mohamed Macan Markar.</p>
<p>Any kind-hearted millionaires out there?</p>
