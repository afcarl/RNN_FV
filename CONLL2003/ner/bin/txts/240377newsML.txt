BOMBAY 1996-12-06

Indian sugar prices held steady in a narrow price band on Friday on continued bulk by consumers for the forthcoming wedding season, dealers said.

Overall supplies were limited and volumes were low.

Ready delivery sugar S-30 remained quiet at 1,225/1,253 rupees per quintal while M-30 was steady at 1,250/1,312 rupees per quintal.

Sugar mill delivery on the other hand fell by 5/10 rupees to 1,140/1,150 rupees per quintal on sluggish demand from outstation buyers which in turn triggered offerings by the mill owners. -- Bombay Commodities +91-22-265 9000
