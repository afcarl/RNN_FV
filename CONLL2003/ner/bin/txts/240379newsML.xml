<p>Sri Lankan stocks closed lower on Friday as the market tried to adjust after falling below the 600-point psychological barrier a day before, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Colombo Stock Exchange all share index closed 1.5 points down at 598.5, below the 600 mark for a second day in a row, after hovering just above for nearly two weeks. It closed at 599.9 points on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is trying to find its place,&quot; said Jardine Fleming HNB deputy general manager Deva Ellepola. &quot;It's trying to adjust mainly to the third quarter corporate results which are coming in below initial expectations,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Brokers also said the index fell on investors' profit taking as they unloaded shares to get liquid for the holiday season.</p>
<p>Turnover was 42.3 million rupees, down from Thursday's 74.4 million. Helping the turnover were packets of blue chip conglomerates Aitken Spence (36,000 at 112 rupees) and John Keells Holdings (55,000 at 194 rupees).</p>
<p>Hatton National Bank (HNB) rose 11 rupees to 251 on early turnover of 1,900 shares on news of HNB's plans to buy the local Indosuez branch. Development bank DFCC fell 1.75 to 283 rupees.</p>
