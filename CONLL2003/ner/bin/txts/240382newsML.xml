<p>Sri Lanka pardoned two soldiers involved in the rape and murder of a minority Tamil girl in exchange for testimony against nine other accused security personnel, Justice Minister G.L. Peiris said on Friday.</p>
<p>Peiris said the action showed the government's determination to stamp out human rights violations by its security forces.</p>
<p>The men were charged in the September 7 rape and murder of a 17-year-old girl who was on her way home from school in northern Jaffna town. Her mother, 16-year-old brother and a neighbour who went looking for the girl also were killed.</p>
<p>Peiris told reporters the two soldiers, who were not involved in the rape and murders but allegedly helped dispose of the bodies, had been offered conditional pardons in return for testifying against seven soldiers and two policemen accused of the crimes.</p>
<p>&quot;A conditional pardon has been offered to two accused in order to buttress the case for the prosecution,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government has pledged to improve the tarnished human rights record of its security forces, which are involved in fighting a separatist rebellion by Tamil rebels in the north.</p>
<p>&quot;We have brought this case before the court -- justice will be done,&quot; Peiris said. &quot;It does not matter who is responsible -- army, police; however high, however low, there's nobody who enjoys immunity from the law.&quot;</p>
<p>The court case against the nine remaining defendants is due to resume in Colombo early next year.</p>
<p>President Chandrika Kumaratunga was elected two years ago on a platform of peace with the separatist rebels and an end to human rights abuses.</p>
<p>Human rights groups have accused government forces of sweeping abuses, including executions, torture and disappearances. The government is investigating allegations of abuses, but denies that violations are still widespread.</p>
<p>Peiris said Sri Lankans expect a sincere commitment to human rights from the ruling People's Alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a fragile situation, it has to be constantly monitored and the government has to do everything in its power to see that fundamental rights are observed in practice,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the 13-year Tamil rebellion. The rebels say the death toll is much higher.</p>
