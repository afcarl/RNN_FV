BOMBAY 1996-12-06

Indian castorseed March delivery rose to 1,132/1,133 rupees from 1,125/1,126 rupees on Friday on easing new crop arrivals and fresh export demand, dealers said.

"New crop arrivals in the producing centres fell due to chilly weather conditions," one dealer said.

Groundnut oil also rose to 347/348 rupees per 10 kg from 343/344 on limited arrivals of 60/70 tonnes coupled with fresh seasonal support. Daily arrivals last week were 100/150 tonnes.

"Expectation that the Indian government may hike import duty on palm oil and reduced imports also helped modest rally in groundnut oil prices," one miller said.
