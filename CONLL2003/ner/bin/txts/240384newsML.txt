A powerful cyclone that has loitered off India's southeast coast for the past two days is likely to hit land on Friday evening, meteorologists said.

"It's likely to cross the coast by evening," said J.V.M. Naidu, head of the cyclone warning centre at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh state.

Naidu said the cyclone, whipping up winds of 90-120 kph (56-75 miles per hour), could hit the coast between Ongole in Andhra Pradesh state and Madras in neighbouring Tamil Nadu state.

Naidu said India's rocket launching centre at Sriharikota could fall within the cyclone's path.

Meteorologists said fresh cyclone warnings had been issued in the districts of Prakasam, Nellore, Chittore and Cuddapah in Andhra Pradesh and North and South Arcot, Chengalpat and Madras in Tamil Nadu.

Officials said the potential for the cyclone to cause damage continued to be high despite the fact the storm had weakened since Thursday morning.

"Even at a reduced speed, the cyclone has tremendous destructive potential," Naidu had said on Thursday evening. "Winds of 100 kph (65 mph) are more than enough to bring down cables, trees and thatched houses."

Meteorologists said warnings had been withdrawn in the districts of Krishna and East and West Godavari as cyclone threats faded in these districts.

J.S.V. Prasad, administrator of East Godavari, said most relief camps in the district had been closed and people told to return to their villages as the cyclone threat had faded.

In Kakinada, headquarters of East Godavari district, traffic returned to normal after rains stopped. Six people had died in the past two days after houses collapsed.

Earlier, authorities had evacuated around 335,000 people from 780 villages along a coastal stretch 90 km (55 miles) long and 10 km (six miles) wide ahead of the storm.

The cyclone could be the second in a month to hit Andhra Pradesh. Last month, at least 2,000 people were killed or are missing after a storm swept through the East and West Godavari districts of the fertile state.
