Sri Lanka reassures business over power.

COLOMBO 1996-12-06

Sri Lankan power officials on Friday reassured business leaders that 1997 would not see a repeat of crippling power shortages that hit the country and caused havoc for industry this year.

"There will be no power cuts (in 1997)," Ceylon Electricity Board general manager for additional power Channa Amarasinghe told the cabinet sub-committee on economic affairs.

The sub-committee brings together business leaders and senior government officials.

"We are meeting regularly with the minister and seeing what new plants can be brought into the system," Amarasinghe said.

He said a 115 megawatt (MW) gas-powered plant and a 40 MW thermal unit were due on line about the middle of 1997.

"There will be private sector generation also," he added.

Amarasinghe said the board was basing its projections on the lowest recorded rainfalls, but said another drought would see further power outages.  

"If there is absolutely no rain, there will definitely be a power cut," he said.

This Indian Ocean island, heavily reliant on hydroelectricity, was hit by severe power shortages this year after a long drought.

The electricity board plans to invest $2 billion over the next decade to almost double the present 1,250 MW power generation and reduce its reliance on hydroelectricity.
