India bows to Western concerns over Agni missile.

The Indian government appears to have quietly bowed to Western pressure by deciding to shelve the Agni ballistic missile, risking a backlash from hardline Hindu rivals and the military establishment, analysts said on Friday.

The decision to put the intermediate-range missile on hold drew stinging criticism from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and appeared bound to revive a simmering debate over the nation's ambiguous nuclear arms policy.

"I am very disappointed with this decision," said Jasjit Singh, director of the state-funded Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.

"The Agni missile development programme must go on," senior BJP leader Jaswant Singh told Reuters.

The decision to shelve the surface-to-surface Agni missile which has a range of 2,500 km (1,500 miles), was quietly conveyed in a Defence Ministry report to parliament, released on Thursday.

The ministry said research on the rocket had been completed after three tests ending in early 1994, and there were no plans to produce the 14-tonne, 19-metre (60-foot) Agni.

But the ministry said the government reserved the option to build the missile if India's security was threatened.

Analysts said the decision was inextricably linked to U.S.-led opposition to India's missile programme, which Washington says could upset regional stability.

"The widely held perception is that India's missile programme has slowed down under U.S. pressure," defence analyst Brahma Chellaney of the Centre for Policy Research said.

"U.S. pressure is the obvious interpretation," Jasjit Singh added.

BJP spokesman Krishan Lal Sharma said: "Development and deployment of this missile should not be delayed or stopped under pressure."

The U.S. embassy in New Delhi said it would reserve comment until it had studied the defence ministry's report.

The Agni, believed capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, is considered a potential deterrent against China, which is a declared nuclear weapons power.

India's 250-km (150-mile) Prithvi missile would be more suited as a deterrent against Pakistan, analysts said.

The decision to shelve the Agni was made public only days after Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited India.

Analysts said the defence ministry's report to parliament was written in August, well before Jiang's trip, but the timing of the news still raised eyebrows.

"The message people might read is that Jiang came here and reassured us to such an extent that we don't need missiles against China," Chellaney said. "The timing is inappropriate and embarrassing to the government."

The BJP accused Deve Gowda's centre-left government, which has sought to improve ties with India's neighbours, of ignoring an alleged security risk posed by Pakistan and China.

"If China supplies M-11 missiles to Pakistan and China has ballistic missiles, it is prudent to take into account the capabilities of nations with whom we have unsettled boundary disputes and a history of arguments," Jaswant Singh said.

Portions of India's borders with both Pakistan and China are in dispute.

The decision to hold back on the Agni compounded confusion over New Delhi's nuclear weapons stance, defence analysts said.

India carried out a nuclear test in 1974. Its long-standing policy, called recessed deterrence, has been to say it does not have a nuclear weapon but retains the option to build the bomb.

"There is no reasoned thinking on the form that a nuclear deterrent should take," retired rear-admiral K.R. Menon said, noting that New Delhi had opposed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to ban nuclear weapons tests.

"Why oppose the CTBT if we do not mean to convert our nuclear weapons capability?" Menon said. "If I were in Washington, I would be completely foxed by Delhi's thinking."

"Recessed deterrence needs an operationally tested missile," Jasjit Singh said, adding that missiles needed two or three dozen tests, not three as with the Agni, to be operational.

"It is meaningless to say you are keeping the nuclear option open unless you have a reasonable missile," he said.
