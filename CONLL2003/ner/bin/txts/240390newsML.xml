<p>The Indian government appears to have quietly bowed to Western pressure by deciding to shelve the Agni ballistic missile, risking a backlash from hardline Hindu rivals and the military establishment, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>The decision to put the intermediate-range missile on hold drew stinging criticism from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and appeared bound to revive a simmering debate over the nation's ambiguous nuclear arms policy.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very disappointed with this decision,&quot; said Jasjit Singh, director of the state-funded Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.</p>
<p>&quot;The Agni missile development programme must go on,&quot; senior BJP leader Jaswant Singh told Reuters.</p>
<p>The decision to shelve the surface-to-surface Agni missile which has a range of 2,500 km (1,500 miles), was quietly conveyed in a Defence Ministry report to parliament, released on Thursday.</p>
<p>The ministry said research on the rocket had been completed after three tests ending in early 1994, and there were no plans to produce the 14-tonne, 19-metre (60-foot) Agni.</p>
<p>But the ministry said the government reserved the option to build the missile if India's security was threatened.</p>
<p>Analysts said the decision was inextricably linked to U.S.-led opposition to India's missile programme, which Washington says could upset regional stability.</p>
<p>&quot;The widely held perception is that India's missile programme has slowed down under U.S. pressure,&quot; defence analyst Brahma Chellaney of the Centre for Policy Research said.</p>
<p>&quot;U.S. pressure is the obvious interpretation,&quot; Jasjit Singh added.</p>
<p>BJP spokesman Krishan Lal Sharma said: &quot;Development and deployment of this missile should not be delayed or stopped under pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. embassy in New Delhi said it would reserve comment until it had studied the defence ministry's report.</p>
<p>The Agni, believed capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, is considered a potential deterrent against China, which is a declared nuclear weapons power.</p>
<p>India's 250-km (150-mile) Prithvi missile would be more suited as a deterrent against Pakistan, analysts said.</p>
<p>The decision to shelve the Agni was made public only days after Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited India.</p>
<p>Analysts said the defence ministry's report to parliament was written in August, well before Jiang's trip, but the timing of the news still raised eyebrows.</p>
<p>&quot;The message people might read is that Jiang came here and reassured us to such an extent that we don't need missiles against China,&quot; Chellaney said. &quot;The timing is inappropriate and embarrassing to the government.&quot;</p>
<p>The BJP accused Deve Gowda's centre-left government, which has sought to improve ties with India's neighbours, of ignoring an alleged security risk posed by Pakistan and China.</p>
<p>&quot;If China supplies M-11 missiles to Pakistan and China has ballistic missiles, it is prudent to take into account the capabilities of nations with whom we have unsettled boundary disputes and a history of arguments,&quot; Jaswant Singh said.</p>
<p>Portions of India's borders with both Pakistan and China are in dispute.</p>
<p>The decision to hold back on the Agni compounded confusion over New Delhi's nuclear weapons stance, defence analysts said.</p>
<p>India carried out a nuclear test in 1974. Its long-standing policy, called recessed deterrence, has been to say it does not have a nuclear weapon but retains the option to build the bomb.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no reasoned thinking on the form that a nuclear deterrent should take,&quot; retired rear-admiral K.R. Menon said, noting that New Delhi had opposed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to ban nuclear weapons tests.</p>
<p>&quot;Why oppose the CTBT if we do not mean to convert our nuclear weapons capability?&quot; Menon said. &quot;If I were in Washington, I would be completely foxed by Delhi's thinking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Recessed deterrence needs an operationally tested missile,&quot; Jasjit Singh said, adding that missiles needed two or three dozen tests, not three as with the Agni, to be operational.</p>
<p>&quot;It is meaningless to say you are keeping the nuclear option open unless you have a reasonable missile,&quot; he said.</p>
