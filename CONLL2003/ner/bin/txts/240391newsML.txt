RESEARCH ALERT - Caspian says sell India's ICICI.

BOMBAY 1996-12-06

Caspian Securities said it recommended a "sell" on shares of Indian term-lending bank Industrial Credit and Investment Corp of India (ICICI).

"ICICI's net interest margins is under severe pressure on both sides of the balance sheet, its asset quality is not as good as had previously been thought, and it is carrying a large unrealised book loss on its investment portfolio," it said.

Caspian said ICICI's accounting practices are not as conservative as people would expect a leading financial institution to adopt.

"Since April 1996, ICICI has underperformed the local market and, from July 1996, it has also under-performed our DFI (development financial institutions) sector index," it said.

"We expect ICICI to continue to trade at a discount to the market on account of poor earnings prospects in the face of continued pressure on the interest margin and its significant NPAs (non-performing assets)," the Caspian report said.

"Previously undisclosed NPAs clearly indicate that the quality of ICICI's loan portfolio is worse than suggested by disclosed NPAs," it said.

"A 2.7 billion book loss on its investment portfolio would wipe out all of forecasted second half 1996/97 net profits if the relevant Reserve Bank of India guideline is followed."
