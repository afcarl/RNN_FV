<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Caspian says sell India's ICICI.</headline>

<p>Caspian Securities said it recommended a &quot;sell&quot; on shares of Indian term-lending bank Industrial Credit and Investment Corp of India (ICICI).</p>
<p>&quot;ICICI's net interest margins is under severe pressure on both sides of the balance sheet, its asset quality is not as good as had previously been thought, and it is carrying a large unrealised book loss on its investment portfolio,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Caspian said ICICI's accounting practices are not as conservative as people would expect a leading financial institution to adopt.</p>
<p>&quot;Since April 1996, ICICI has underperformed the local market and, from July 1996, it has also under-performed our DFI (development financial institutions) sector index,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect ICICI to continue to trade at a discount to the market on account of poor earnings prospects in the face of continued pressure on the interest margin and its significant NPAs (non-performing assets),&quot; the Caspian report said.</p>
<p>&quot;Previously undisclosed NPAs clearly indicate that the quality of ICICI's loan portfolio is worse than suggested by disclosed NPAs,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;A 2.7 billion book loss on its investment portfolio would wipe out all of forecasted second half 1996/97 net profits if the relevant Reserve Bank of India guideline is followed.&quot;</p>
