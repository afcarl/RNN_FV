<headline>India term lenders' margins under pressure - Caspian.</headline>

<p>India's term lending development financial institutions (DFIs) are facing a margin squeeze which would continue, Caspian Securities said in a research report.</p>
<p>Indian DFIs are also facing intense competition on all fronts, the report by Caspian analyst Hemindra Hazari said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although greater efficiency and superior tax planning have given DFIs better profitability levels than commercial banks, their margins are now under severe pressure and we expect their relative profitability to fall,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Furthermore, now that disclosure and account transparency are being scrutinised more closely than ever before, there are growing doubts and concerns about DFI asset quality,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Caspian cited the following negatives:</p>
<p>+ Margins are falling and fee-based income levels are low: DFI profitability is heavily dependent on the interest margin, which is under pressure, and the likelihood of them increasing their profitability in the short-term is limited. Significant non-fund based income will take time to develop.</p>
<p>+ Asset quality concerns: Inadequate disclosure disguises true NPA (non-performing asset) levels. The application of normal, conservative standards would produce gross NPA levels which, particularly for ICICI and IFCI, are both high and of signficant concern.</p>
<p>SCICI on the other hand is a notable exception.</p>
<p>+ Competition is intensifying: DFIs now have to compete openly for funds in the market, with non-bank finance companies, which offer higher rates, and with commercial banks which have extensive retail networks. On the lending side, competition from capital market is a long-term threat as companies can directly raise capital at cheaper rates.</p>
<p>+ Long-term lending inherently more risky: Inadequate security on assets, which could be depreciated faster than the related loan amortisation, is compounded by the nature of the assets themselves -- typically large-scale plant and equipment which is difficult to re-sell if necessary.</p>
<p>+ Frequent equity increases: DFIs get tax concessions from special reserve transfers but only if this reserve does not exceed twice the non-bonus paid-up capital. The implication is that they will increase their equity every time the reserve reaches the limit, otherwise they will lose the tax benefit.</p>
<p>+ Removal of tax concessions would hurt: Although DFIs have to regularly dilute their equity to take advantage of the special reserve concession, it lowers their effective tax rate from 43 percent to approximately 26 percent. Therefore, if the tax shield were to be removed, dilution would diminish but tax rate would rise considerably.</p>
<p>On the positive side, Caspian said DFI shares were trading at significant discounts. Their overall profitability ratios were stronger than the profitable state-run commercial banks. DFIs are well capitalised and were very efficient.</p>
