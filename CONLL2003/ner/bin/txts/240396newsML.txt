Record number of rigs seeking oil/gas in Egypt-minister.

GOA, India 1996-12-06

A record number of drilling rigs are exploring for and developing oil and natural gas in Egypt, oil minister Hamdi el Banbi said on Friday.

In an interview with Reuters, he said there were 40 rigs in concessions that cover more than 50 percent of Egypt's territory.

In 1995 there were never more than 35 rigs in operation, he added.

"At present we have about 40 drilling rigs...exploring or developing oil and gas fields in Egypt. This is the highest ever," he said. The minister is in Goa to attend the fifth meeting of world oil consumers and producers.

He said Egypt had awarded 13 concession agreements in 1996 to several international companies. The agreements bring commitments to drill about 82 exploratory wells and expenditures of US$295 million.

However, he said he expected only about 10 concessions agreements to be awarded next year.

"But the activity will be more than 1996 because we will be exploring and developing previous discoveries that have been found during 1995 and 1994," he said.

"A concession agreement can take eight years. Once you have a certain number of concession agreements you are with these people for at least eight years until they are developed."

He said Egypt would be able to maintain current production levels of around 860,000 barrels per day (bpd) through the turn of the century.

"We are planning to keep oil production almost constant for the next five years."

Egypt has hoped discoveries in the Western Desert would offset declining production from older fields in the Gulf of Suez. U.S.-based Apache Oil and Spain's Repsol both made significant finds in the area this year.

Egypt is also keen to boost natural gas production for domestic use and a potential export project to Israel. Current output of 1.4 Billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd) is expected to swell to two Bcfd by the turn of the century.

Top oil executives believe a rapid succession of gas finds in the Nile Delta in the last two years have made the area one of the most promising in the world for gas exploration.

"We are planning to take care of the increase in local consumption by local gas utilisation," the minister said.

He said Egypt's energy consumption was rising by two percent per year.

The minister also said Egypt remained committed to a joint venture refinery project with Israel.

The 100,000 bpd refinery, which would cost $1.2 billion and employ 300 people, is being backed by private Egyptian and Israeli firms though the Egyptian government is due to take a 20 percent stake. The plant will be located west of Alexandria.

The minister's comments echoed those made recently by Egyptian investors in the proposed project, who said it would proceed despite the current stalemate in the Middle East peace process.

"Egypt believes that credibility is much more important than other things. We hope that the other parties will take that into consideration also," the minister said.

"It is an agreement that has been done between companies and everything is going on according to schedule."
