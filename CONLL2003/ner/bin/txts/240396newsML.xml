<p>A record number of drilling rigs are exploring for and developing oil and natural gas in Egypt, oil minister Hamdi el Banbi said on Friday.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters, he said there were 40 rigs in concessions that cover more than 50 percent of Egypt's territory.</p>
<p>In 1995 there were never more than 35 rigs in operation, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;At present we have about 40 drilling rigs...exploring or developing oil and gas fields in Egypt. This is the highest ever,&quot; he said. The minister is in Goa to attend the fifth meeting of world oil consumers and producers.</p>
<p>He said Egypt had awarded 13 concession agreements in 1996 to several international companies. The agreements bring commitments to drill about 82 exploratory wells and expenditures of US$295 million.</p>
<p>However, he said he expected only about 10 concessions agreements to be awarded next year.</p>
<p>&quot;But the activity will be more than 1996 because we will be exploring and developing previous discoveries that have been found during 1995 and 1994,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;A concession agreement can take eight years. Once you have a certain number of concession agreements you are with these people for at least eight years until they are developed.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Egypt would be able to maintain current production levels of around 860,000 barrels per day (bpd) through the turn of the century.</p>
<p>&quot;We are planning to keep oil production almost constant for the next five years.&quot;</p>
<p>Egypt has hoped discoveries in the Western Desert would offset declining production from older fields in the Gulf of Suez. U.S.-based Apache Oil and Spain's Repsol both made significant finds in the area this year.</p>
<p>Egypt is also keen to boost natural gas production for domestic use and a potential export project to Israel. Current output of 1.4 Billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd) is expected to swell to two Bcfd by the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Top oil executives believe a rapid succession of gas finds in the Nile Delta in the last two years have made the area one of the most promising in the world for gas exploration.</p>
<p>&quot;We are planning to take care of the increase in local consumption by local gas utilisation,&quot; the minister said.</p>
<p>He said Egypt's energy consumption was rising by two percent per year.</p>
<p>The minister also said Egypt remained committed to a joint venture refinery project with Israel.</p>
<p>The 100,000 bpd refinery, which would cost $1.2 billion and employ 300 people, is being backed by private Egyptian and Israeli firms though the Egyptian government is due to take a 20 percent stake. The plant will be located west of Alexandria.</p>
<p>The minister's comments echoed those made recently by Egyptian investors in the proposed project, who said it would proceed despite the current stalemate in the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;Egypt believes that credibility is much more important than other things. We hope that the other parties will take that into consideration also,&quot; the minister said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an agreement that has been done between companies and everything is going on according to schedule.&quot;</p>
