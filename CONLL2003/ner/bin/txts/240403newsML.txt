Indian call money rates were quoted at 0.10-0.25 percent on Friday, the fortnightly reporting day for banks, dealers said.

Dealers expect call rates to open around 4.0-5.0 percent on Saturday, the first day of the new fortnight.

"Next fortnight is expected to be tight with the third instalment of advance taxes which will flow out in the second half of December," ICICI Securities and Finance Company said in a debt market survey released earlier this week.

"Profitability of the corporate sector for the first half of 1996/97 has shown a dip due to higher interest cost and hence the advance tax outflow will be significantly lower than in September," the report said.

It estimated the advance tax outflow between 40 and 50 billion rupees.
