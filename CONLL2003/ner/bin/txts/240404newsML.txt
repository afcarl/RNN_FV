A severe cyclone which has been threatening India's southeast coast for the past two days, is now moving west and is likely to hit southern Tamil Nadu state, meteorologists said on Friday.

"It is expected to hit the coast between Madras (in Tamil Nadu state) and Ongole (in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh state) on Friday afternoon," said an official at the meteorological department in Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh.

He told Reuters the brunt of the cyclone's fury may be borne by Tamil Nadu rather than Andhra Pradesh.

He said the cyclone was now moving in a westerly direction, but other officials noted its movement had been haphazard and remained unpredictable.

"The behaviour of the storm remains erratic and we are still not certain when and where it will hit. We are maintaining all the cyclone alerts along the coast," an official at the cyclone warning centre at Visakhapatnam port said.

On Thursday, meteorologists said the cyclone was centered 150 km (94 miles) southeast of Nellore, near Ongole.

In Kakinada, headquarters of East Godavari district, traffic returned to normal after rains stopped. Six people had died in the past two days after houses collapsed.

Moderate to heavy rain, accompanied by strong winds, had been reported in the coastal areas, meteorological officials said.

Late on Thursday, officials said although the cyclone was stationary it was still a potential threat.

"We are advising people not to go back yet," said Chitra Ramachandran, administrator of the coastal Krishna district.

"When a system is stationary, it can either die down or intensify," said J.V.M. Naidu, head of the cyclone warning centre at Visakhapatnam. "This year, we have had some bad experiences so we are anticipating the worst."

The storm weakened on Thursday morning with wind speeds falling to 90-120 kph (55-75 mph) from 150-180 kph (95-115 mph) earlier, according to meteorologists.

"Even at a reduced speed, the cyclone has tremendous destructive potential," Naidu said. "Winds of 100 kph (65 mph) are more than enough to bring down cables, trees and thatched houses."

Officials said around 335,000 people had been evacuated from 780 villages along a coastal stretch 90 km (55 miles) long and 10 km (six miles) wide ahead of the storm.

The cyclone could be the second in a month to hit Andhra Pradesh. Last month, at least 2,000 people were killed or are missing after a storm swept through the East and West Godavari districts of the fertile state.
