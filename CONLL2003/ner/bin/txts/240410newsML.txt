Mother Teresa improving day by day - doctors.

CALCUTTA 1996-12-06

Mother Teresa is improving with each passing day following life-saving heart surgery last week, her doctors said on Friday.

"Last night she didn't sleep till one o'clock. She was talking to her sisters," a morning medical bulletin issued by Calcutta's B.M. Birla Heart Research Centre said.

"Mother Teresa's condition is improving day by day," the bulletin added.

Mother Teresa had surgery last Friday to clear two blocked coronary arteries, her third such operation in five years.

But an irregular heartbeat, bronchial pneumonia, and long-standing kidney and lung problems complicated her recovery.

"She is looking cheerful, but according to the doctor on call she is still not out of danger," the bulletin said.

Doctors believe Mother Teresa's recovery will take a long time and say the nun, who was fitted with a heart pacemaker in 1989, may never be as active as before.
