Cyclone moves away, more likely to hit south India.

HYDERABAD, India 1996-12-06

A severe cyclone, threatening India's southeast coast, is moving away in a westerly direction and more likely to hit the southern state of Tami Nadu, meteorologists and local officials warned on Friday.

"It is expected to hit the coast between Madras (in Tamil Nadu) and Ongole (in southeast Andhra Pradesh state) on Friday afternoon," said an official at the meteorological department in Hyderabad, capital of Andhra Pradesh.

He told Reuters the brunt of the cyclone's fury may be borne by Tamil Nadu rather than Andhra Pradesh.

But other officials said the cyclone has been moving in a zig-zag direction and remained unpredictable.

"The behaviour of the storm remains erratic and we are still not certain when and where it would hit. We are maintaining all the cyclone alerts along the coast," an official at the cyclone warning centre at Visakhapatnam port said.

Earlier officials said though the cylone had moved away it was still a potential threat.

"We are advising people not to go back yet," said Chitra Ramachandran, administrator of the coastal Krishna district.

Meteorologists said the cyclone, which has threatened Andhra Pradesh state in the past two days, had moved some 200 km (125 miles) off the coast and stopped.

"When a system is stationary, it can either die down or intensify," said J.V.M. Naidu, head of the cyclone warning centre at Visakhapatnam port. "This year we have had some bad experiences. So we are anticipating the worst."

The storm weakened in the morning with its wind speed falling to 90-120 kph (55-75 mph) from 150-180 kph (95-115 mph) earlier, according to meteorologists.

"Even at a reduced speed, it retains tremendous destructive potential," Naidu said. "Winds of 100 kph (65 mph) are more than enough to knock down cables, trees and thatched houses."

He said the storm could hit the coast on Friday morning if it changed course.

Relief officials said fresh alerts had been issued to evacuate people in coastal villages of the districts of Nellore, Prakasam and Chittore.

Authorities in coastal districts said there was no let-up in their vigilance despite the weakening of the cyclone.

"We are still on full alert. We have not been told when the cyclone will hit. We are ready for it whenever it comes," Ramachandran said.

In November 1977, a severe cyclone whipped up tidal waves killing more than 10,000 people in villages near Machilipatnam.

"As the behaviour of the cyclone has been erratic so far, we are on full alert as it may still swing around and hit the coast," a spokesman for the state government said.

Officials in the said around 335,000 people had been evacuated from 780 villages along a coastal stretch 90 km (55 miles) long and 10 km (six miles) wide ahead of the storm.

The storm would be the second in a month to hit Andhra Pradesh. At least 2,000 people were killed or are missing after last month's cyclone.
