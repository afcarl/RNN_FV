<p>A severe cyclone, threatening India's southeast coast, is moving away in a westerly direction and more likely to hit the southern state of Tami Nadu, meteorologists and local officials warned on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is expected to hit the coast between Madras (in Tamil Nadu) and Ongole (in southeast Andhra Pradesh state) on Friday afternoon,&quot; said an official at the meteorological department in Hyderabad, capital of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>He told Reuters the brunt of the cyclone's fury may be borne by Tamil Nadu rather than Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>But other officials said the cyclone has been moving in a zig-zag direction and remained unpredictable.</p>
<p>&quot;The behaviour of the storm remains erratic and we are still not certain when and where it would hit. We are maintaining all the cyclone alerts along the coast,&quot; an official at the cyclone warning centre at Visakhapatnam port said.</p>
<p>Earlier officials said though the cylone had moved away it was still a potential threat.</p>
<p>&quot;We are advising people not to go back yet,&quot; said Chitra Ramachandran, administrator of the coastal Krishna district.</p>
<p>Meteorologists said the cyclone, which has threatened Andhra Pradesh state in the past two days, had moved some 200 km (125 miles) off the coast and stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;When a system is stationary, it can either die down or intensify,&quot; said J.V.M. Naidu, head of the cyclone warning centre at Visakhapatnam port. &quot;This year we have had some bad experiences. So we are anticipating the worst.&quot;</p>
<p>The storm weakened in the morning with its wind speed falling to 90-120 kph (55-75 mph) from 150-180 kph (95-115 mph) earlier, according to meteorologists.</p>
<p>&quot;Even at a reduced speed, it retains tremendous destructive potential,&quot; Naidu said. &quot;Winds of 100 kph (65 mph) are more than enough to knock down cables, trees and thatched houses.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the storm could hit the coast on Friday morning if it changed course.</p>
<p>Relief officials said fresh alerts had been issued to evacuate people in coastal villages of the districts of Nellore, Prakasam and Chittore.</p>
<p>Authorities in coastal districts said there was no let-up in their vigilance despite the weakening of the cyclone.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still on full alert. We have not been told when the cyclone will hit. We are ready for it whenever it comes,&quot; Ramachandran said.</p>
<p>In November 1977, a severe cyclone whipped up tidal waves killing more than 10,000 people in villages near Machilipatnam.</p>
<p>&quot;As the behaviour of the cyclone has been erratic so far, we are on full alert as it may still swing around and hit the coast,&quot; a spokesman for the state government said.</p>
<p>Officials in the said around 335,000 people had been evacuated from 780 villages along a coastal stretch 90 km (55 miles) long and 10 km (six miles) wide ahead of the storm.</p>
<p>The storm would be the second in a month to hit Andhra Pradesh. At least 2,000 people were killed or are missing after last month's cyclone.</p>
