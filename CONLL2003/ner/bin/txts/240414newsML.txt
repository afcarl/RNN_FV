Threat of higher interest rates may cap stock market.

NEW YORK

The fear that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who has presided over the strongest bull market ever, might boost interest rates could cool the euphoria that has boosted stocks nearly 60 percent in the last two years.

The high-flying market was taken down Friday, one day after Greenspan hinted that a hike in short-term interest rates might be needed to slow the stunning rise in stocks -- a rally which has been driven by a record flow of cash into mutual funds.

Prior to Friday's break, the Dow Jones industrial average racked up a solid gain for the year of nearly 26 percent on top of a spectacular jump of 33.5 percent in 1995.

Just last month, the Dow index rallied 500 points.

In late afternoon trading Friday, the world's most closely watched stock index was off about 52 points at 6,385 after bouncing back from an early loss of more than 140 points.

For the week, the Dow was off about 133 points from last Friday's close of 6,521.70.

Wall Street called time out after Greenspan sent a clear message that things may be getting out of hand, and investors needed to restrain themselves.

In typical Greenspan-speak, the Fed chief said the central bank had to be wary of "irrational exuberance" infecting stock and other markets.

He also said that while inflation was still low, its future course was uncertain and the Fed had to be ready when setting policy to take action before dangers developed.

Tea-leaf readers viewed the Fed chairman's comments as a hint that interest rates may have to go up if the stock market does not cool down.

The economy has done well under Greenspan, growing at a good pace, with inflation running at the lowest rate in decades, which has helped the market's historic rally.

Fed policy-makers next meet on Dec. 17 and are widely expected to hold rates steady, given moderate economic growth and low inflation.

Analysts said the market reacted violently to Greenspan's comments because it brought back memories of a plunge of some 10 percent in stocks when the Fed started raising interest rates in February 1994.

It was the first of seven rate hikes before the central bank reversed course and rate cuts in July 1995 followed by two more cuts, last December and in January.

"Mr. Greenspan's message was that he's finally become concerned about the degree of speculation in financial markets and he put out a warning sign that people should not assume that interest rates will go down forever," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co.

He said the stock market was already set to sell off and Greenspan's comments simply gave investors an excuse to head for the exits.

"Everybody was waiting and hoping that they could defer any selling until the first of the year but they all panicked Friday," Metz said.

Does that mean an end to the "easy money" days of the mid-1990s for stock traders and investors?

Some experts noted the stock market environment has not changed overnight, and economic forces would still determine stock prices.

"Greenspan's comment was purely informational," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers. "But it was news to the world that how the stock market does" was an indicator "on the Fed's radar screen," he said.

Historically, Sinai said, a booming stock market is followed 12 to 24 months later by rising inflation, and rising stock prices have become one factor the Fed considers in anticipating inflation.

Analysts said that Greenspan's comments could take some of the steam out of the market.

"Now we have a situation where one individual wants to ticker with a fluctuating market, and the economic situation will depend on thought processes and potential action of one man," said John Geraghty at North American Equity Services, a consulting firm.

He predicted that uncertainty could make for a choppy and erratic market.

"The most serious impact will be that it will draw some investors, probably international money, out of the stock market until the dust settles," Geraghty said.
