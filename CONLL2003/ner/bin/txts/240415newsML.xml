<p>Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp., faced with an unsolicited takeover bid by Newmont Mining Corp., is likely to be courted by Homestake Mining Co. if the company rejects Newmont's offer, analysts said Friday.</p>
<p>Santa Fe is so far mum on the more than $2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from Newmont, announced Thursday.</p>
<p>Wall Street speculates that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a &quot;bear hug,&quot; or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor, analysts said.</p>
<p>Newmont said the companies have had previous contact, but it has declined to detail the encounters.</p>
<p>Analysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder, and that if a rival buyer is found, Newmont may not be able to match its offer.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Homestake could come in as a white knight, but how much is someone willing to come in above the Newmont number,&quot; PaineWebber Inc. analyst Marc Cohen said. &quot;One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent, but there is going to be a (Santa Fe) deal with someone.&quot;</p>
<p>Newmont is offering 0.33 share of its stock for each Santa Fe shares. In New York Stock Exchange trade, Newmont fell 25 cents to $46.875, while Santa Fe rose 50 cents to $15.375.</p>
<p>&quot;Newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with Santa Fe, which is almost always a euphemism for 'We have more money in our pocket,'&quot; said one stock trader, referring to a possible sweetened bid from Newmont.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Santa Fe deal, which includes desirable Nevada mining territory, would only benefit Newmont in the long term. Newmont, in fact, will not gain from the deal on an earnings basis for at least two years, which also limits its capacity to raise its offer.</p>
<p>Any deal, friendly or hostile, would almost assuredly be a stock swap, which is necessary if the deal is to be accounted for as a tax-free pooling of interest, they said.</p>
<p>Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick Gold Corp. and Bre-X Minerals Ltd. as Santa Fe saviours because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting Indonesia's Busang vast gold deposit.</p>
<p>Placer Dome Inc. too was considered unlikely.</p>
<p>A Homestake spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list.</p>
<p>Homestake, based in San Francisco, operates gold mines in the United States, Australia, Chile and Canada. It earned $30.3 million on revenues of $746.3 million in 1995.</p>
<p>Santa Fe has mining and exploration operations in Nevada, California, Montana, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Chile, Kazakstan, Mexico and Ghana. The company, based in Albuquerque, N.M., had 1995 earnings of $40 million, or 30 cents a share, on revenues of $350 million.</p>
