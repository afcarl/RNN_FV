Greenspan calls for Social Security benefit cuts.

Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan Friday made clear that the privatisation of Social Security was not a panacea for the pension program's ills and called for cuts in benefits to help rescue it.

"Clearly, something has to give," the central bank chief told the Union League in Philadelphia. "We cannot hope to grow our way out of the problem."

He suggested increasing the age at which retirees are eligible to draw on the Social Security programme and trimming annual costs-of-living increases for current beneficiaries as two ways to help the "badly underfunded" system.

Greenspan, who triggered a global stock price plunge by hinting late Thursday that the stock market may be overvalued, avoided any further mention of the subject in his speech Friday and later declined to respond to reporters' queries.

The half-trillion-dollar Social Security trust fund that is used to pay government pension benefits to the elderly will begin to feel the pinch in the year 2010 as baby boomers start to retire and will eventually go bust if no changes are made.

Politicians have been loathe to do anything about it, out of fear that tinkering with what they term the "third rail" of government programmes would trigger red-hot reactions from the powerful seniors' lobby.

Recently, some analysts have suggested privatising Social Security as one way to plug the future hole. A panel appointed by President Clinton is expected to recommend doing just that in a report later this month.

Under privatisation, money in the Social Security trust fund would be invested in stocks, not just Treasury bonds, as a way of earning higher returns.

But Greenspan argued that any gains made by such a shift would be offset by lower returns on private pension programmes. In fact, he foresaw "great market tension" resulting from such a move as stock prices rose and bond prices fell.

That does not mean that he opposes at least some partial privatisation of Social Security. But he said such a step would only be a net plus if it encouraged people to save more.

"If the Social Security system is to survive in its current form, either real benefits must be curtailed or real taxes increased," Greenspan said.

He made clear that his preference was for benefit cuts and suggested several, including raising the age at which retirees are eligible to draw Social Security payments and trimming annual cost-of-living increases to existing beneficiaries.

The eligibility age for Social Security payments now stands at 65, although it is slated to rise intermittently to 67 by the year 2027.

Currently, Social Security and other government benefits are raised annually in line with increases in the consumer price index.

But a congressionally appointed commission this week said the CPI overstates inflation by 1.1 percentage points a year, effectively costing the government tens of billions of dollars in pension benefits each year.

Greenspan, who in the past has made the same general point as the commission, praised its work.

"Hopefully, other modifications in Social Securty benefits also will be judged as necessary," he added, without elaborating.
