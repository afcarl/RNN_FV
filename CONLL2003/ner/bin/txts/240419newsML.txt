U.N. readies Iraq oil-for-food plan.

Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali could give clearance for the start of the Iraqi oil-for-food plan as early as Monday, paving the way for Iraq to enter world oil markets for the first time in six years.

Some senior U.N. officials were fairly certain the go-ahead would be given on Monday but Boutros-Ghali himself was cautious.

He said he could not confirm a Monday date because "still I have not received the complete report of my experts," a reference to inspectors from the Netherlands-based firm Saybolt.

"When I receive it I will have a meeting, and on the basis of this meeting we will decide (when the clearance for oil sales can be given)," he told reporters.

At issue is Security Council Resolution 986 that allows Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to buy food, medicine and other necessities for its people, suffering from the sanctions imposed in August 1990 after Baghdad's troops invaded Kuwait. Nearly two-thirds of oil sales revenues are earmarked for needy Iraqis.

The procedure is for Boutros-Ghali to give a one-page report to the council, after which the deal can go ahead a minute past midnight, New York time, on the following day.

At U.N. headquarters, a group of oil experts or overseers who need to approve any contracts before Iraq can start shipping the oil, are returning to New York next week, an indication the deal was being readied.

"We're still iffy on the timing," U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said. "Obviously we are getting closer to the magic moment for the implementation of Resolution 986. But we cannot pinpoint with any accuracy when he will be able to transmit the final report to the Council."

Boutros-Ghali is awaiting word from Saybolt inspection agents that all pipeline systems are operational. The inspectors landed in Iraq earlier this week to conduct tests on vital oil-metering equipment at the Zakho station along the Turkey-Iraq border.

A previous Saybolt visit to the Zakho facility showed malfunctioning equipment, which was to be repaired by the Iraqis, eliminating the last technical hurdle for geting the oil flowing.

Iraqi Oil Minister General Amir Muhammad Rasheed said oil exports would start on Tuesday. But, U.N. officials downplayed the timing, noting the work schedule for the overseers was not settled and oil contracts can take up to 24 hours for review.

Iraq and the United Nations signed the terms for the oil-for-food deal on May 20, but implementation has been a lengthy process and was actually suspended in early September after Iraqi troop incursions into northern Kurdish regions of the country.

All political obstacles were removed on November 25, however, when Iraq dropped demands for control of key aspects for monitoring the deal, and other details.

Before invading Kuwait, Iraq exported more than three million barrels per day (bpd). Considering current world oil prices, Iraqi oil exports would amount to under 600,000 bpd, according to the oil deal scheme.
