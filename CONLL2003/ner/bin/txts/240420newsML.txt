Canada markets see sharp drops for second day.

Canadian financial markets posted sharp declines for a second straight session Friday, although many markets pared losses by late in in the day, following Thursday's so-called "made-in-Canada meltdown."

Analysts said Friday's losses stemmed mainly from weak U.S. markets, which weighed on Canadian bonds, stocks and currency.

"The negative sentiment that's occurring in the U.S. is clearly the big catalyst today," said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist with Bank of Montreal.

Canadian stocks, bonds and the currency all opened sharply lower Friday, extending losses from Thursday's broad-based sell-off.

Although Canadian bonds experienced the most severe losses Thursday, Canadian stocks led markets lower early Friday.

The benchmark Toronto Stock Exchange 300 index fell more than 1 percent at the open, then lost almost 3 percent of its value. Leading the index lower was the heavily weighted interest-sensitive financial services subgroup.

The TSE index was down 36.35 points at 5,805.40 in late trading after falling as much as 170 points earlier in the day.

The Canadian dollar also weakened severely Friday morning, falling past C$1.3600 (73.53 cents) and prompting the Bank of Canada to buy the Canadian dollar on currency markets for the third time this week.

Canadian bonds also opened lower, with the benchmark 30-year bonds down C$1.75 to C$109.10 to yield 7.224 percent in early trade, after experiencing their biggest one-day loss in more than two years Thursday.

Unlike Thursday's session, in which various causes were blamed for the sell-off, analysts attributed much of Friday's weakness to comments Thursday night by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. In a speech, Greenspan commented on the "irrational exuberance" in financial markets.

Canadian stocks and the dollar were especially hurt by Greenspan's remarks, analysts said.

"I think everybody rushed for the exit (from Canadian stocks) at the same time," said Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. investment strategist Michael Metz. "Greenspan's remarks suggested the markets are inflated."

Canada's dollar weakened overnight after the speech. The dollar's overnight weakness prompted the Bank of England to intervene on currency markets on behalf of the Bank of Canada.

Greenspan's comments sparked concerns that the Fed could soon raise U.S. rates, which would make Canadian Treasury bills less attractive and likely weaken the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar.

Canadian financial markets trimmed many of their heavy losses by midday Friday. Bonds staged a dramatic turnaround from opening levels amid buying from domestic investors attracted to higher yields.

Equity analysts also said that despite the roller coaster ride in Toronto's stock market, its key index would resume its upward march and continue to outperform Wall Street in the New Year.

Economists and analysts said the most bullish factor for Canadian financial markets going into the New Year was that Canada's positive fundamentals, such as low inflation and improving government finances, remained in place.

The fundamentals for the currency and bonds were particularly positive, analysts said.

"For 1997 we remain moderately upbeat on both of those markets and view some of the turmoil that we're seeing right now as just a bit of a correction," said Bank of Montreal's Ferley.
