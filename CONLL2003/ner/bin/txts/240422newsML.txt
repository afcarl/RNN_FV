Continental pilots to hire adviser on Delta deal.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Continental Airlines Inc.'s pilots union said Friday it planned to hire its own financial advisers to evaluate a possible merger with Delta Air Lines Inc.

The union did not comment on whether it supported a potential merger, but said it planned to conduct its own financial analysis.

The union did not comment on which financial advisory firm it would retain.

In a phone message for its members, the Independent Association of Continental Pilots said it initiated talks with Delta's union and with the Air Line Pilots Association to discuss a potential deal.

The union said its efforts to meet with Continental's management have been rebuffed.

The company told the pilots that it was prohibited by law from commenting on the issue, beyond a letter issued to employees on Wednesday, the union said.

In that memo, Houston-based Continental did not confirm or deny it was holding merger talks with Delta but said no deal was imminent.

"We certainly understand that management is limited on what they can and cannot say without stepping outside SEC limitations. However, a blanket refusal to meet with union leadership to allow us to express our concerns ... is disappointing, to say the least," the union said.

Continental officials did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the union's plan to conduct an independent evaluation of any combination with Atlanta-based Delta, which if completed, would create the world's largest airline.
