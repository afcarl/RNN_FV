<title>USA: Continental pilots to hire adviser on Delta deal.</title>
<headline>Continental pilots to hire adviser on Delta deal.</headline>

<p>Continental Airlines Inc.'s pilots union said Friday it planned to hire its own financial advisers to evaluate a possible merger with Delta Air Lines Inc.</p>
<p>The union did not comment on whether it supported a potential merger, but said it planned to conduct its own financial analysis.</p>
<p>The union did not comment on which financial advisory firm it would retain.</p>
<p>In a phone message for its members, the Independent Association of Continental Pilots said it initiated talks with Delta's union and with the Air Line Pilots Association to discuss a potential deal.</p>
<p>The union said its efforts to meet with Continental's management have been rebuffed.</p>
<p>The company told the pilots that it was prohibited by law from commenting on the issue, beyond a letter issued to employees on Wednesday, the union said.</p>
<p>In that memo, Houston-based Continental did not confirm or deny it was holding merger talks with Delta but said no deal was imminent.</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly understand that management is limited on what they can and cannot say without stepping outside SEC limitations. However, a blanket refusal to meet with union leadership to allow us to express our concerns ... is disappointing, to say the least,&quot; the union said.</p>
<p>Continental officials did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the union's plan to conduct an independent evaluation of any combination with Atlanta-based Delta, which if completed, would create the world's largest airline.</p>
