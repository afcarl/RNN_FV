Budapest dominated Central and East European markets this week, racing to an all-time high on Thursday. On Friday, Hungarian share prices sagged, in line with a trend on most European markets.

The Prague exchange picked up under light domestic buying and shares in Ljubljana were on the rise. Bratislava struggled with low liquidity, while Warsaw continued a horizontal trend.

Prices retreated in Bucharest and Zagreb and Tirana had two trades in treasury bills.

The Central European Share Index (CESI), which includes 73 Hungarian, Czech and Polish, Slovak and Slovenian stocks, closed on Friday 0.32 percent lower on the week.

BUDAPEST

The Budapest bourse set three successive highs this week benefiting mainly from the strenghtening of the dollar, before a fall ahead of the weekend.

On Friday, Hungarian share prices tumbled, following in the footsteps of most European exchanges.

A drop in the dollar, triggered by a speech of U.S. Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, and an overheated Hungarian market were behind the fall.

On Friday the BUX index plunged 88.86 points, chopping most of the week's gains. Overall, the BUX ended at 3,714.59 points, 13.6 points higher than last Friday.

PRAGUE

The Prague Stock Exchange gained ground throughout the week, though analysts said they were not convinced the bourse's fortunes had turned around. They attributed the rise to thin domestic buying.

The PSE stumbled through most of the autumn, losing close to 20 percent as key investors sold positions, tired of a market characterised as unregulated and murky.

But the PX50 index has rebounded slightly over the past two weeks, closing on Friday at 515.4 points, up 0.98 percent on the week.

WARSAW

Polish shares fell slightly this week and analysts said the market's month-long horizontal trend would likely last into next week amid a general lack of positive signals.

Analysts said the slightly stronger selling after price fixing on Friday signalled a possible slight fall on Monday.

They said the relatively busy public offering schedule next week suggested the market could see another slight fall.

The main market's WIG index closed at 13,531.1 points, down 258.6 points or 1.9 percent from last Friday's close.

BRATISLAVA

Leading Slovak shares closed steady in casual trading, with the main action in direct trades, under thin interest and small liquidity.

The 12-share SAX index eased 0.80 point to close at 167.94 on Friday.

Brokers said they expected little change in the overall trend until the Christmas break from December 19 to January 7.

Overall volume rose and turnover grew to 791.18 million crowns from Thursday's 91.71 million.

ZAGREB

Croatian stocks closed the week lower after a firmer start, but they seemed poised to reverse a long downward trend thanks to what traders said was renewed foreign investor interest.

Volume picked up in revived trading, with the total weekly turnover six times higher than a week ago.

LJUBLJANA

Share prices firmed 2.7 percent this week, with the 10-share SBI index up 31.5 points to 1,191.6.

BUCHAREST

Thin investor interest kept turnover levels low this week, with 29.8 million lei on Thursday, a scant four million up on the previous session, and depressed most prices.

Two unofficial value-weighted indices - the VAB, computed by Vanguard SA, and  Bucharest Investment Group 's BIG -- fell from the previous session. The VAB fell 0.2 percent to 293.9 points and the BIG slipped 0.17 percent to 293.04 points.

TIRANA

The seven-month-old exchange had two transactions this week, with a total 85 million leks in 364-day T-bills changing hands at its two trading days.
