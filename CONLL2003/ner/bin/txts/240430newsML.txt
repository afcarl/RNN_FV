NTT to be restructured but plan draws fire.

Japan Friday unveiled a long-delayed plan to split up the giant Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., but analysts dismissed the plan as a half-hearted compromise.

Under the plan approved by the government and NTT, the company will be split into two regional local companies and a long-distance company under a holding company umbrella.

NTT says it will cost 450 billion yen ($4 billion) and take at least two years to carry out the restructuring, which comes after years of wrangling and indecision.

The moves will enable NTT to realise its long-held dream of entering the international market, although that could still be a few years away.

"Japan should no longer lag behind in the international telecommunications field," said Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.

But industry analysts were unimpressed, saying the plan would do little to bring competition to the lagging telecommunications market in Japan and would not help NTT battle increasingly formidable opponents abroad.

"The new scheme means NTT remains one big company," said Yoshio Suzuki, a former member of a government deregulation committee.

"We can't expect such things as harsh rate cuts, competition and reasonable services. It is welcome news for BT (British Telecommunications) and the world's big carriers that Japan's market will remain inactive for years," he said.

NTT said the reorganization was expected to take at least two years, delaying its entry into the global market.

"We believe we need two years after the government passes the necessary bills before we can split. We think it is difficult to do so in 1998 and we think it will take place in 1999," a senior NTT official told a news conference.

High rates and lack of innovation in Japan's telecommunications sector have become an increasing worry to policy-makers as innovations leap ahead elsewhere, leaving Japan behind in a crucial area.

"It's a major victory (for NTT)," said one telecommunications expert, who doubted the changes would tackle efficiency problems at NTT. "I personally don't think this solves a lot of the problems of monopoly."

NTT is two-thirds owned by the government and dominates the domestic phone market with an 80 percent share.

It is also one of the world's biggest corporate bureaucracies with 185,000 workers, although that is down from more than 200,000 several years ago.

The government first proposed that NTT be broken up in the 1980s and a decision has since been deferred three times.

The case for a breakup has been fuelled as telecom companies grow ever bigger by gobbling up industry rivals.

But NTT argued that mergers such as the planned $20 billion combination of MCI Communications Corp. and British Telecommunications Plc made it unwise to break up its own power.

NTT President Junichiro Miyazu told a news conference that the company would fight the breakup if the government failed to abide by the compromise conditions spelled out by the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry.

"If the conditions are not kept, we may cancel out the whole plan," he said.
