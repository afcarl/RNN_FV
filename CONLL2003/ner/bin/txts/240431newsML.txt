U.S. High Court to decide Internet indecency case.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

The Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide a landmark case on free-speech rights in cyberspace arising from a federal law that effectively bans indecent material on the Internet global computer network.

The U.S. high court said it would hear a Justice Department appeal seeking to reinstate the law's prohibition on the dissemination of sexually explicit material to those under 18 years old.  

Backed by President Bill Clinton, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to overturn a precedent-setting ruling in June by three federal judges in Philadelphia declaring unconstitutional key parts of the Communications Decency Act.

The nine high court members will hear oral arguments in the case early next year, with a decision due by July.

The law, signed by Clinton in February as part of a telecommunications overhaul, bars the distribution to minors of indecent or "patently offensive" materials on the Internet, which is used by an estimated 40 million people.

The law had been challenged on free-speech grounds by the American Civil Liberties Union and groups representing libraries, publishers and the computer on-line industry.
