<title>USA: U.S. High Court to decide Internet indecency case.</title>
<headline>U.S. High Court to decide Internet indecency case.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide a landmark case on free-speech rights in cyberspace arising from a federal law that effectively bans indecent material on the Internet global computer network.</p>
<p>The U.S. high court said it would hear a Justice Department appeal seeking to reinstate the law's prohibition on the dissemination of sexually explicit material to those under 18 years old.  </p>
<p>Backed by President Bill Clinton, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to overturn a precedent-setting ruling in June by three federal judges in Philadelphia declaring unconstitutional key parts of the Communications Decency Act.</p>
<p>The nine high court members will hear oral arguments in the case early next year, with a decision due by July.</p>
<p>The law, signed by Clinton in February as part of a telecommunications overhaul, bars the distribution to minors of indecent or &quot;patently offensive&quot; materials on the Internet, which is used by an estimated 40 million people.</p>
<p>The law had been challenged on free-speech grounds by the American Civil Liberties Union and groups representing libraries, publishers and the computer on-line industry.</p>
