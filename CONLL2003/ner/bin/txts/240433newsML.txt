EU signs new trade deal with Faroe Islands.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

The European Union signed a new trade deal on Friday with the Faroe Islands, which have home rule under the Danish crown but decided not to join the bloc together with Denmark in 1973.

The deal, signed on the sidelines of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, will replace the accord in force since 1992.

Like its predecessor, the new agreement is based on free trade, taking into account the enlargement of the EU to bring in Finland, Sweden and Austria last year.

However, a limited number of sensitive fish and agricultural products coming from the Faroe Islands would continue to face EU tariff quotas and/or monitoring measures, the European Commission said in a statement.

The windswept islands in the North Atlantic are almost entirely dependent on fisheries.
