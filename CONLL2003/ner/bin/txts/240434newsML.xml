<p>France tore into Ireland's draft European Union treaty on Friday, threatening Dublin's carefully laid plans for a smooth EU summit next week.</p>
<p>In discordant tones that were sharply at odds with those of his EU colleagues, French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette blasted a planned revision of the bloc's Maastricht Treaty as not ambitious enough.</p>
<p>&quot;It mirrors the mediocrity of the negotiations so far,&quot; de Charette said. &quot;Do we want to work together in the EU?&quot;</p>
<p>He said France would insist at the December 13 and 14 summit in Dublin that action be taken to strengthen EU institutions, forge deeper links in matters such as immigration and crime fighting, and to bolster joint foreign and defence policy.</p>
<p>De Charette's outburst at the draft treaty, cautiously crafted by EU president Ireland to avoid clashes at what is still an early state in negotiations, ran counter to the generally positive reaction of many other ministers.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel praised parts of the draft as &quot;ambitious&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It shows that progress has been made,&quot; he told reporters, adding that there was need for further negotiation before the treaty itself would be ready.</p>
<p>Italy echoed this in a statement, saying the treaty, designed to prepare the bloc for a dozen or more new members, was a &quot;satisfactory text open to further improvements&quot;.</p>
<p>Even Britain, opposed to many of the proposals contained in the draft, said the document was acceptable.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to present the positions in a fair and comprehensive way,&quot; British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said. &quot;It is a very good basis for further negotiations.&quot;</p>
<p>Britain has been seeking to play down predictions that the treaty draft would feed the turmoil over Europe currently infecting the ruling Conservative party.</p>
<p>The draft, unveiled by Ireland on Thursday, is designed as a working paper for an eventual treaty to be approved by EU leaders at a summit in Amsterdam in June next year.</p>
<p>Ireland deliberately made no suggestions for how to deal with some of the most controversial issues.</p>
<p>These include whether to water down a country's right to veto EU legislation, how many European commissioners there should be in an expanded Union, and how to permit &quot;flexibility&quot; -- allowing some countries to integrate faster than others.</p>
<p>Rifkind welcomed this, but de Charette said France could not accept a document that was &quot;weak&quot; on institutional reform.</p>
<p>Others were far more conciliatory. Sweden welcomed the draft as proof that a treaty could be agreed by next June.</p>
<p>Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen, echoing comments of others, praised the deftness with which Ireland had drafted the clearly written report.</p>
<p>One treaty negotiator said Ireland had been very clever in the way it had presented the draft -- creating an escape clause for countries like Britain by not requiring anyone to agree with anything at this stage.</p>
<p>Despite this, the draft does contain proposals likely to be jumped on by Euro-sceptics in Britain, Denmark and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Britain, for example, has already said it will not countenance a proposal to lift border controls across the bloc.</p>
<p>Denmark has indicated its opposition to plans to give the European Commission more of a say in external affairs, notably in trade in services.</p>
<p>Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said the Irish presidency had done a good job but that there were elements that were not acceptable to Denmark.</p>
