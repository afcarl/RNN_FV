<p>Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said on Friday that Ireland's draft European Union treaty had been well received and that finance ministers were near to agreeing on a stability pact for the EU's planned single currency.</p>
<p>Bruton, whose country currently holds the EU presidency, said after meeting Helmut Kohl that the German chancellor also saw the draft as a basis for further negotiations on EU reform.</p>
<p>Ireland on Thursday unveiled a draft which attacks crime and unemployment but skirts divisive issues like voting rights and flexible integration which Britain would oppose.</p>
<p>&quot;The reaction to this has been good. The chancellor is of that opinion, I believe,&quot; Bruton said after the meeting he described as &quot;very successful&quot;.</p>
<p>The prime minister, who will visit Paris and London next week before hosting the summit on December 13-14, said he hoped the summit would agree on the stability pact Bonn has proposed. It is designed to ensure members of the economic and monetary union (EMU) would maintain budgetary discipline after joining.</p>
<p>The main unresolved issue was how to define when a member nation is running an excessive deficit and can be penalised.</p>
<p>&quot;The positions are not very far apart,&quot; he told reporters in Bonn, adding that all EU members agreed on the goal of making the euro a strong and stable currency.</p>
<p>He hoped the summit would agree a link between currencies outside EMU and the euro, and annual budget reviews for all member countries as part of the stability pact.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe this whole range of issues, on which 98 percent agreement has already been reached by the economic and finance ministers, is essential to our common objective of a strong European currency,&quot; Bruton said.</p>
<p>He added the Dublin summit would give the final formal approval to the decision to launch EMU on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>A plan for multi-speed integration, the so-called &quot;flexibility clause&quot; that Germany and France say is essential for any real reform of the EU, may not need to be written into the new treaty, the prime minister added.</p>
<p>&quot;We already have flexibility in the sense that we have opt-outs for two countries in certain matters,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There were strong arguments for and against including a &quot;flexibility clause&quot; and the issue would be the subject of intense negotiations between now and the June 1997 summit in Amsterdam due to approve the new treaty, he said.</p>
<p>Bruton said he and Kohl had also agreed the Dublin summit should make a strong statement on the goal of fighting unemployment in the EU.</p>
<p>The summit would also focus on preparing an action plan for fighting organised crime which should be ready for approval in Amsterdam, he added.</p>
<p>The issue of the sexual abuse of children, &quot;a problem of particular concern in several European countries&quot;, would also be addressed, he said.</p>
