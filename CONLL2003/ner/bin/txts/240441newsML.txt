CanWest Global Communications Corp said on Friday it entered a financing agreement with an Australian company to allow that company to acquire shares in Ten Group Ltd, increasing CanWest's economic interest in the network to about 66 percent.

CanWest said it lent the unidentified Australian company about A$105 million, which was used directly and indirectly to acquire about 17 percent of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Network Ten.

CanWest owns 15 percent of Network Ten's ordinary shares and certain participating and convertible debentures of Network Ten, together representing a 57.5 percent interest in the Australian television network.
