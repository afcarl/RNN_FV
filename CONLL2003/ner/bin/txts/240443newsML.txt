Bank of Canada bought Canadian dollars - traders.

TORONTO 1996-12-06

The Bank of Canada intervened on Friday and bought Canadian dollars for U.S. dollars as the currency traded around the C$1.3640 level, dealers said.

The intervention was through brokers and was considered light as the currency weakened through key support.

Following the intervention, the Canadian dollar was trading at C$1.3610 after opening at C$1.3617 and Thursday's close of C$1.3563. Traders expect further losses.

The Bank of Canada does not comment on intervention.
