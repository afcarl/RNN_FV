Cott Corp said on Friday that chairman and chief executive Gerald Pencer would add the role of president.

The company said the shift would allow current president David Nichol to focus on building Cott's food business as president and CEO of Destination Products International, which is 85 percent-owned by Cott and 15 percent by Nichol.

Cott also said it planned to realign its beverage business into six world-wide divisions, four of these in North America, one in the U.K. and Europe and one in Asia. It will also introduce various cost-cutting measures.
