Canada Q3 capacity utilization rises to 83.8 pct.

OTTAWA 1996-12-06

Canadian capacity utilization in total non-farm goods-producing industries rose 1.3 percentage points to 83.8 percent in the third quarter from a revised 82.5 percent in the second, Statistics Canada said on Friday.

A survey of Reuter economists had forecast the rate to rise to 84.0 percent in the quarter.  

Statistics Canada said the rise in capacity utilization in the quarter came mostly from gains in the manufacturing sector.

Manufacturers increased their use of capacity to 84.3 percent in the third quarter and according to latest Business Conditions Survey by StatsCan, they intended to continue stepping up production in the next three months.

That, however, would not lead to a rise in inflation, the agency said.
