<p>Following are reactions to unemployment data released by Statistics Canada on Friday. Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate was unchanged at 10.0 percent in November from October.</p>
<p>Economists in a Reuters survey had forecast, on average, the rate to dip to 9.8 percent from 10.0 percent in October.</p>
<p>Michael Gregory, economist, Lehman Brothers - &quot;This is a pretty sluggish number here -- unemployment unchanged at 10.0 percent, employment up a paltry 7,000. It does suggest the Canadian economy is still struggling to create jobs.&quot;  </p>
<p>Michael Gregory - &quot;I think it is neutral for rates because the Canadian economy is picking up steam and there already is quite a lot of ease in the system...But it does raise a little question about the sustainability of the upbeat numbers we've been getting, particularly in housing and autos.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark Mullins, chief economist, Midland Walwyn - &quot;We've had some strong gains, so month-to-month volatility isn't something I am really worried about. I am actually quite comfortable with this report given that we had a good rise in help wanted yesterday.&quot;  </p>
<p>Doug Porter, economist, Nesbitt Burns - &quot;I would say the report is definitely on the disappointing side. I would say it's even a little bit weaker than the sluggish headline number suggests given that most of the growth was in part-time.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the other (recent) indicators have suggested the economy is coming back, but this just reinforces that the bounce-back is not that strong. Certainly it underlines that the Bank of Canada does not want to tighten policy any time soon.&quot;</p>
