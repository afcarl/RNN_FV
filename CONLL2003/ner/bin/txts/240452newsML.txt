A Reuters survey of economists had forecast the unemployment rate to drop to 9.8 percent and employment to grow by 39,000 in November.

Part-time employment rose by 30,000 from the month before, but most of the gains were erased by declines in full-time employment.

Statistics Canada said employment rose 35,000 since April, compared to 202,000 in the first four months of the year.

Employment in the service sector grew by 44,000 in November, the strongest monthly increase so far this year. But on a year-over-year basis, it rose only 0.7 percent or 70,000.  

Employment in the goods producing sector rose 2.8 percent from the same time last year.

There was little change in either private or public employment in November. A 40,000 gain among self-employed workers was offset by a 37,000 private employee jobs loss.
