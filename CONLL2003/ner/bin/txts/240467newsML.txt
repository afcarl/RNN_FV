RESEARCH ALERT - Vanstar starts as neutral.

-- Lehman Brothers said on Friday it had started coverage of Vanstar Corp with a rating of neutral.

-- "Of its peers, Vanstar is the most profitable at four percent operating margins, and derives the greatest amount of its revenues (approximately 15 percent in its latest quarter) from high-margin services which generate 44 percent gross margins," analyst Kimberly Alexy wrote in a report.

-- "The company has grown its services business at triple-digit rates, albeit off a relatively small base, and we expect that Vanstar can maintain this level of growth for the next several quarters."

-- He added, "While we believe that the company is well-managed and well-positioned to continue to generate growth in excess of the industry, we believe that the current stock price largely reflects the favorable outlook."

-- He set fiscal year 1997 and 1998 estimates for earnings per share of $1.08 and $1.50, respectively.

-- Shares were trading down 7/8 at 25-3/8 in early morning trade.
