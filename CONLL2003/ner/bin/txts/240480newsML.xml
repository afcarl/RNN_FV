<p>HOLLYWOOD - NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer checked himself into the Betty Ford Treatment Center in Rancho Mirage Thursday morning to undergo treatment in the center's 28-day in-patient program.

<p>HOLLYWOOD - Things have suddenly gotten a little bit backward in the professional life of KABC-AM's Larry Elder.

Meanwhile, a group with whom Elder has long disagreed philosophically, the American Civil Liberties Union, has vowed to back the host in his fight to keep his job.</p>
<p>HOLLYWOOD - Stacey Snider, former president of production for Sony -owned TriStar Pictures under Marc Platt, was officially reunited with her old boss Thursday when she was named co-president of production for Universal Pictures, as had been expected for the last two months.</p>
