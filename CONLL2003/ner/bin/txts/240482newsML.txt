Physicians Resource to place convertibles.

DALLAS 1996-12-06

Physicians Resource Group Inc, which provides physician practice management services, said Friday it agreed to privately place $125 million in total principal amount of six percent convertible debt due 2001.

The debentures would be unsecured obligations convertible into Physicians Resource common stock at a conversion price of $25 per share at any time 60 days after issuance, the company said. The placement was expected to close on December 11.

Net proceeds would be used to repay bank debt incurred from acquisitions, and to fund potential future acquisitions, the company said.
