Columbia U. leading inflation index 103.1 in Nov.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

The Center For International Business Cycle Research (CIBCR) leading inflation index (LII) fell to 103.1 in November from a revised 103.6 in October, CIBCR said.

The six-month smoothed annualized growth rate of the LII fell to -1.2 percent from -0.5 percent, it said.

Recent declines in the index resulted from slower growth in industrial materials prices and a smaller number of purchasing managers reporting higher prices, CIBCR said.

"U.S. inflation remains low," said a CIBCR report.

CIBCR is affiliated with Columbia University.
