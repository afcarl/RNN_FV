Fed refrains from open market operations.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

The Federal Reserve refrained from open market operations on Friday, dealers said.

The Fed's absence in the market came as no surprise as the federal funds continued to trade below the Fed's 5-1/4 percent target. At 1130 EST/1630 GMT, the usualy time the Fed enters the market, federal funds were traded at 5-3/16 percent.

Analysts said the market is still expecting the Fed to add permanent reserves to the banking system through a coupon pass operation soon, but not necessarily on Friday.
