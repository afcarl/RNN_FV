Int'l Thoroughbred holder to sell stock.

CHERRY HILL, N.J. 1996-12-06

International Thoroughbred Breeders Inc said Robert Brennan, who owns about 25 percent of the company's stock, plans to sell his shares to NPD Inc, a company formed by Nunzio DeSantis and Anthony Coelho.

Brennan said the base sale price is $4 a share, subject to certain adjustments.

The proposed sale is subject to the several conditions, such as approval by the bankruptcy court which is overseeing Brennan's Chapter 11 proceedings and the purchaser arranging a two-year $5 million unsecured line of credit for International Thoroughbred's benefit.

International Thoroughbred owns and operates the Garden State Park and Freehold Raceway, two horse racing tracks in New Jersey.
