Bells re-examine video plans, CAI hit.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Bell Atlantic Corp said Friday that it and merger partner NYNEX Corp are re-evaluating their methods for offering video to homes after disappointing results from wireless cable firm CAI Wireless Systems Inc.

CAI stock was down 1-1/8 to 1-5/8 after the New York Times first reported the Bells' move.

"CAI hasn't managed the penetration in the East Coast cites that we hoped for. That obviously means some re-examination of the strategy for delivering video," Bell Atlantic spokesman Eric Rabe said.  

The two Bells have invested $100 million in CAI, which plans to use microwave signals, beamed by line of sight to wall-mounted receivers, to deliver television signals.

However, the proportion of homes which could be reached in trials has proven uneconomically low because of signal obstruction by hills, trees and other buildings.

On the West Coast the technology has had fewer problems.

Rabe said Bell Atlantic may issue a statement later on what its plans were. He declined any further comment.

The New York Times said the Bells were considering using satellite technology instead of microwave signals.

The newspaper predicted that TeleTV, a venture to produce programming and entertainment that is owned by the two Bells and Pacific Telesis Group, would end up being folded into Bell Atlantic as a result.

The report also said Bell Atlantic and NYNEX were considering buying a stake in American Sky Broadcasting (ASkyB), a venture between Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd and MCI Communications Corp.
