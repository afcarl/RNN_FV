<title>USA: Bells re-examine video plans, CAI hit.</title>
<headline>Bells re-examine video plans, CAI hit.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bell Atlantic Corp said Friday that it and merger partner NYNEX Corp are re-evaluating their methods for offering video to homes after disappointing results from wireless cable firm CAI Wireless Systems Inc.</p>
<p>CAI stock was down 1-1/8 to 1-5/8 after the New York Times first reported the Bells' move.</p>
<p>&quot;CAI hasn't managed the penetration in the East Coast cites that we hoped for. That obviously means some re-examination of the strategy for delivering video,&quot; Bell Atlantic spokesman Eric Rabe said.  </p>
<p>The two Bells have invested $100 million in CAI, which plans to use microwave signals, beamed by line of sight to wall-mounted receivers, to deliver television signals.</p>
<p>However, the proportion of homes which could be reached in trials has proven uneconomically low because of signal obstruction by hills, trees and other buildings.</p>
<p>On the West Coast the technology has had fewer problems.</p>
<p>Rabe said Bell Atlantic may issue a statement later on what its plans were. He declined any further comment.</p>
<p>The New York Times said the Bells were considering using satellite technology instead of microwave signals.</p>
<p>The newspaper predicted that TeleTV, a venture to produce programming and entertainment that is owned by the two Bells and Pacific Telesis Group, would end up being folded into Bell Atlantic as a result.</p>
<p>The report also said Bell Atlantic and NYNEX were considering buying a stake in American Sky Broadcasting (ASkyB), a venture between Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd and MCI Communications Corp.</p>
