NYMEX refined products fall on Elf strike news.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

NYMEX heating oil and gasoline fell Friday on news French workers voted to end a strike at one out of three Elf Aquitaine refineries, traders said.

Traders noted the oil complex was already due for profit-taking after rallying sharply all week.

"We already had made new highs in a lot of the contracts, and with one of the strikes being settled, it may lead the way to the other two being settled," said James Cordier, a trader with Allendale Inc.

At 1100 EST, January heating oil was off 1.41 cents a gallon at 73.70 cents.  

January gasoline was off 1.23 cents at 68.45 cents a gallon, and January crude was off 43 cents at $25.15 a barrel.

Workers were still voting at two other refineries owned by French oil giant Elf Aquitaine on whether to end a strike which has lasted nine days and crippled a quarter of French refinery capacity. The strike over job cuts has boosted refined product prices here and in Europe.

In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is expected to give clearance for the start of Iraqi oil sales Monday, a U.N official said.  

Under an oil-for-food accord signed May 20, the United Nations would ease sanctions against Iraq and allow Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil in exchange for humanitarian aid.

But, traders attributed much of crude's weakness to the fall in refined products since they said the possibility of the deal's clearance next week was already discounted in crude's price.

"We are looking for the okay from Saybolt since the market already knew the deal could go through next week anyway," said a dealer.

Two experts from the Dutch firm Saybolt arrived in Baghdad on Tuesday to see whether Iraq's oil gauging equipment on the border with Turkey was working properly.
