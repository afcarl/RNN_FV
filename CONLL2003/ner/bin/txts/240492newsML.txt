ECRI monthly future U.S. inflation gauge 105.2 Nov.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

The Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI) monthly future inflation gauge (FIG) was unchanged at 105.2 in November from the revised October figure, ECRI said.

It's smoothed annualized growth rate rose to -3.5 percent from -4.5 percent, ECRI said.

Slower growth in employment and industrial materials prices neutralized upward pressure from purchasing managers' reported delivery times and a narrower spread between the yields of 10-year and three-month Treasuries, it said.

"The level of the FIG has changed very little since this summer after declining for well over a year," ECRI's report said. "Disinflationary pressures have virtually disappeared, while underlying inflation pressures have yet to gain a decisive foothold."
