JB Oxford says not hurt by Stratton Oakmont affair.

LOS ANGELES 1996-12-06

JB Oxford & Co said Friday it would suffer no negative financial impact as a result of the NASD's expulsion of Stratton Oakmont Inc from the securities industry.

NASD also fined Stratton, its president Daniel Porush and head trader Steven Sanders, citing "willful disregard" of regulations.

JB Oxford said the actions giving rise to the expulsion occurred prior to Stratton's becoming a correspondent of JB Oxford. Stratton was a broker-dealer correspondent clearing through JB Oxford.

"We are working closely with the NASD to facilitate orderly transactions for the customers affected by this ruling," said Stephen Rubenstein, president and chief executive officer of JB Oxford.
