Chemi-Trol hires advisor, eyes unit sales.

GIBSONBURG, Ohio 1996-12-06

Chemi-Trol Chemical Co said on Friday it retained McDonald & Co to advise it in connection with the potential sale of two of its non-core businesses -- Cal-Van Tools and Cory Orchard & Turf.

The company said that after a strategic review of its business segments, it decided to concentrate on its chemical and propane tank segments, which offered Chemi-Trol the best opportunity for sustained earnings growth.

Cal-Van Tools is in the automotive aftermarket business and Cory Orchard is in the agricultural chemical industry.

Chemi-Trol said both units had solid market position but would see greater growth if owned by companies which specialized in these areas.
