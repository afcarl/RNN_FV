<headline>Possis gets FDA nod for AngioJet system.</headline>

<p>Possis Medical Inc said Friday it received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market its AngioJet Rapid Thrombectomy System for removal of blood clots from grafts used by patients on kidney dialysis.</p>
<p>The AngioJet System is designed to remove blood clots non-surgically from arteries, veins and grafts throughout the body.  </p>
<p>&quot;We now look forward to growing product sales and expanding labeling claims, pending further FDA clearances, to include dangerous and often life-threatening blood clots in vessels and grafts that affect patients' legs and vital organs such as the heart, lungs and brain,&quot; Robert Dutcher, president, said in a statement.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;During extensive clinical trials, the AngioJet System has been shown to offer significant medical benefits when compared to the most common treatments for removing blood clots -- clot-dissolving drugs and the use of medical devices that require surgical intervention,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>He said Possis believes the AngioJet System offers significant cost savings over traditional treatment.</p>
<p>Possis Medical said it will begin selling the AngioJet System immediately throughout the United States. International sales for peripheral and coronary use are already underway, primarily in Europe.</p>
<p>The company estimates that the worldwide market potential for all AngioJet System applications exceed 2.5 million disposable units annually.</p>
<p>The AngioJet system includes a drive unit, single-use pump and a variety of single-use catheters. Two catheters, the F105 and LF140, were included in the clinical trial for use in peripheral, or arm and leg, arteries and for vascular access.</p>
<p>It added that a Phase II clinical trial in the United States will continue involving its LF140 catheter for coronary applications. Possis said it plans to seek FDA approval for this application during 1997.</p>
<p>To date, clinical results for coronary use have been &quot;extremely encouraging.&quot; Additionally, plans are underway for U.S. clinical trials for stroke and venous applications.</p>
