Union sees Mo. nuke fully back this weekend.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Union Electric Co expected its 1,125 megawatt (MW) Callaway nuclear generation station in Fulton, Mo., to resume full operation this weekend after being idled Sunday to repair a leaking seal in a hydraulic system.

"It'll be back to 100 percent some time this weekend," a company spokesman said.

He said a minor turbine trip, due to an imbalance of water level in the steam turbine overnight, did not affect the startup of the plant.

As of 0825 CST, Callaway was operating at 54 percent of capacity, he added.

The Callaway station represents about 25 percent of the company's generation capacity, and is one of nine power plants owned and operated by Union Electric.
