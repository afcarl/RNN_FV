NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Shell Oil Co experienced leaks in its coking unit at its Deer Park, Texas refinery earlier in the week according to Texas regulators. On Friday, some industry sources said the coking unit was off line.

A regulator at the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission said he had no knowledge of a shutdown, but some traders and analysts said the 50,000 barrel per day unit might be off-line for two to three weeks of maintenance.
