Fibreboard Corp resumes stock buyback plan.

DALLAS 1996-12-06

Fibreboard Corp said on Friday it resumed a $20 million share repurchase program, first implemented in June 1995.

Fibreboard said it had suspended its share buyback program around October 1995, when it announced the sale of its core wood products business and refocused its businesses.

Under the program, the company is authorized to purchase common stock with a total value of up to $20 million, Fibreboard said. In 1995, it repurchased 215,700 shares for a total cost of $5.2 million.
