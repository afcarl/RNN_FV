U.S. BLS chief says contacted about CPI hearings.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics has been contacted by the Senate Finance Committee regarding possible hearings in January on the consumer price index, a senior official said Friday.

Katharine Abraham, commissioner for the bureau, told reporters nothing firm had been set.

A panel appointed by the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday issued a report concluding that the CPI overstates inflation by 1.1 percentage points per year, a controversial finding that could have significant implications for the federal budget.
