U.S. BLS's Abraham says earnings jump broad-based.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

Katharine Abraham, commissioner for the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, on Friday said the nine cent jump in average hourly earnings in November was "reasonably broad-based" with no indications the figure was skewed by any one industry.

Asked by reporters whether the recent increase in the minimum wage enacted was at play in the hourly wage gain, she said that did not appear to be the case.

The labor official said her agency's "back of the envelope calculations" suggested that the impact of the minimum wage rise was only about a cent or two, occuring when the hike first took place.

Labor Department earlier on Friday reported that average hourly earnings climbed to $11.99 from $11.90 in November.

Abraham reiterated that the average hourly wage series tends to be erratic.
