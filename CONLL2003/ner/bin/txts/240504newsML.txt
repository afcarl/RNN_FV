Brazilian debt rise a warning light -- Calvo.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

U.S.-based economist Guillermo Calvo expressed concern over the rise in Brazilian debt relative to monetary aggregates since 1993, but said it would not likely result in a crisis.

Calvo spoke to investors at a Latin American conference at Bear Stearns and Co Inc in New York.

In speaking of the rise in foreign and domestic public service debt compared to M2, Calvo said: "In Brazil, there is a warning light. The good news is most of the debt is in the domestic banking sector."  

"I am confident that so far, to the extent this debt is held in the banking sector, even though it is increasing very fast, it could not lead to a crisis," Calvo said.

The University of Maryland economist who predicted Mexico's 1994 financial crisis said: "The worst that could happen to Brazil in the medium term is they go back to a higher inflation plateau. But that will not necessarily affect growth."

Calvo expressed optimism regarding Mexico's recovery since 1994, and said the country is "moving in the right direction".

He said the country had learned its lesson from trying to use domestic credit to cushion credit crunch situations in the banking sector.

He added that currently Mexico is much more willing to let interest rates do the job as evidenced by their lack of intervention in the foreign exchange market so far in 1996.

Regarding Argentina, Calvo said his main concern was unemployment. Calvo, who is Argentine, served briefly as an aide to Economy Minister Roque Fernndez.
