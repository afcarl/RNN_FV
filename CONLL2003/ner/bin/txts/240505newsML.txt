NSC names Barnhart as CEO.

BOSTON 1996-12-06

NSC Corp said it named Victor Barnhart as chairman and chief executive and Darryl Schimeck president and chief operating officer, effective immediately.

The moves fill positions held by Frank Fradella -- formerly NSC's president and CEO -- who resigned in August to take a job at a Houston-based construction company.

Barnhart, 54, has been NSC's president and CEO for the past three months, the company said.

Schimeck, 36, has run NSC's union business -- which contributes half NSC's revenue, according to a company spokesman -- since July 1995.
