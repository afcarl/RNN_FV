NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Detroit Edison's 1,116 megawatt (MW) Fermi 2 nuclear power plant in Monroe County, Mich., was expected to begin the restart process Friday following a repair outage, a company spokeswoman said.

"It should resume the startup process at about midday today," spokeswoman Mary Kay Bean said Friday, adding the unit would likely go through "several days" of restart testing before synchronizing to the electricity grid.

The unit was shut for electrical repairs Dec 2 while in restart mode following a scheduled 63-day maintenance and refueling outage.

Detroit Edison is a subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.
