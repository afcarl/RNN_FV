Fed seen adding reserves via customer repos.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is expected to add temporary reserves to the banking system on Friday via customer repurchase agreements.

"I'm expecting a customer RP today," said Dana Saporta, economist at Stone and McCarthy Research Associates Inc.

Analysts at MMS International are also expecting the Fed to add reserves via customer repos.

At 1005 EST/1505 GMT, the federal funds were traded at 5-3/16 percent, below the central bank's 5-1/4 percent target.  

Analysts said the market is still expecting the Fed to add permanent reserves to the banking system through a coupon pass operation soon, but not necessarily on Friday.
