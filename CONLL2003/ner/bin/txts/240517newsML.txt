Reich-U.S. economy growing at two pct or more - RFTV.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

Labor Secretary Robert Reich Friday called the November jobs report mixed, but said the economy still seems to be growing at a two percent annualized clip or better.

"It's not too hot, it's not too cold," Reich told Reuters Financial Television. "We probably are talking about growth of two percent or better," he added.

The Labor Department reported earlier that the unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent in November from 5.2 percent in October as jobs growth slowed to 118,000 from 224,000.  

Reich said it was hard to say if the unemployment rate has bottomed out. "We are seeing about a year of unemployment under 5.5 percent," he said. "It seems to me it's likely to stay in that range."

The outgoing Labor Secretary said the rise in the unemployment rate last month was mostly due to new entrants into the labor market, rather than because of a loss of jobs.

"I am relatively positive about where we are going on employment growth," Reich added, "although there is clearly a slowdown."  

In today's jobs report, the Labor Department also reported that average hourly earnings rose nine cents an hour in November.

Reich though saw no reason to be concerned about wage-push inflation. With jobs growth slowing, "it doesn't feel like this economy is overheating in any way," he said.

Summing up, Reich said the economy was in "remarkably good shape overall." But he voiced concern about "extreme" income inequality. "We do need in this country to be very concerned lest we develop a two-tiered society," he said.
