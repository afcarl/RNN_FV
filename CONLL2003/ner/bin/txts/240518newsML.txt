Cymer stockholders raise share offer.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

Cymer Inc said Friday its selling stockholders raised the number of shares they are offering for sale by 30,000 to 730,000 common shares.

In an amended filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Cymer said the company's original offer of one million common shares still stands.

However, after the increased offer, outstanding shares will now total 13,428,771 common, up from the previous 13,419,456 common, the filing said.

The selling stockholders also increased the 30 day over allotment option to underwriters to purchase up to 259,500 additional common shares from the 255,000 common previously.

The offering will be made through Morgan Stanley & Co Inc, Montgomery Securities and Needham & Co Inc.
