<p>MEHL/Biophile International Corp said Friday it has started action to end a joint venture between Laser Industries Ltd and a MEHL/Biophile subsidiary.</p>
<p>The venture was formed in December 1995 when Laser and Classy Lady by Mehl of Puerto Rico Inc, now owned by MEHL/Biophile, agreed to exploit patented laser hair removal technology exclusively licensed to Classy Lady.</p>
<p>The venture, Sharplan 2000 Inc, is equally owned by Classy Lady and Laser and is managed by Laser.  </p>
<p>On Thursday, MEHL/Biophile said it had placed 20 of its proprietary Chromos 694 ruby long-pulse laser hair removal systems with various professionals around the world.</p>
<p>Each system, once placed, and after 90 days, will generate a minimum of $15,000 per month in revenue, the company said.</p>
<p>MEHL/Biophiol said it will have 30 to 35 systems in the field by year-end and will produce 30 systems per month starting in January.</p>
<p>The laser systems are being placed under licenses which require the licensee to pay MEHL/Biophile monthly the greater of a percentage of revenue or $15,000, the company said.  </p>
<p>Based on information discovered by MEHL/Biophile, Classy Lady has brought an action to terminate the license granted to Sharplan 2000 and unwind the Laser venture, the company said.</p>
<p>MEHL/Biophile said it is basing this action on a dispute concerning the nature of technological and financial contributions to be made to the venture by Laser and an additional dispute concerning whether Laser used technology within the venture that was developed by a third party, SLS Wales Ltd, a Welsh laser company.</p>
<p>In June 1996, MEHL said, it acquired an 81 percent interest in SLS, which has been renamed SLS (Biophile) Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not believe that Laser was completely forthright with us concerning representations that we relied on when we started the joint venture. We also believe that Laser is seeking to use technology developed by SLS in Sharplan 2000 which it may not be legally entitled to use,&quot; MEHL/Biophile said, adding that it is confident it will be able to conclude this action quickly.</p>
<p>In a separate action filed in England, MEHL/Biophile said, SLS is seeking orders preventing Laser from using SLS technology and stopping SLS's manufacturer from supplying SLS technology to Laser.</p>
