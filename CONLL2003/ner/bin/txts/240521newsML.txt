NEW YORK 1996-12-06

CSX Corp said on Friday it started a tender offer to buy some 18.3 million common and Series A convertible junior preferred shares of Conrail Inc for $110 a share in cash.

CSX completed its first tender offer for about 20 percent of the shares on November 21. After Friday's tender, CSX will own about 40 percent of Conrail's fully diluted shares.

The latest tender offer expires at midnight, January 6, CSX said.  On Thursday, CSX and Conrail sued Norfolk Southern Corp in U.S. District Court, accusing Norfolk Southern of trying to break up their $8.7 billion merger agreement.
