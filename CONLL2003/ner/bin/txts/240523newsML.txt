Cytrx unit, Zynaxis to merge.

ATLANTA 1996-12-06

CytRx Corp and Zynaxis Inc said Friday they had agreed to merge Zynaxis with CytRx's Vaxcel Inc subsidiary to create a new public company.

Paul Wilson, Vaxcel president and chief executive offier, will head the new company, which will be headquartered in Atlanta, they said.

The deal is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 1997, they said.

The new Vaxcel shares are expected to trade on the Nasdaq SmallCap market. CytRx will own about 87 percent of the outstanding shares of the new company.  

As part of the agreement, Zynaxis is seeking a buyer for its Cauldron Process Chemistry division, expected to be sold in 1997, they said.

Cauldron, located in Malvern, Pa., provides process research and development and production of bulk pharmaceutical chemicals.
