TransTexas North Dakota flow understated.

HOUSTON 1996-12-06

TransTexas Gas Corp said its statement Wednesday reporting the flow rate of the Heart River No. 1 in Dickinson, N.D., understated the discovery well's actual recorded production.

After evaluating the volumes flowed to tanks during the test, the company said Friday, it found the actual rate was 6,836 barrels of oil daily, not the 6,355 listed Wednesday.

As a result of the discovery well's flow volumes, TransTexas said, it is increasing the completion equipment for its second well in the filed, the Dinsdale 2-4, to optimize the well's flow capabilities.  

The changes in completion equipment include larger tubing, choke equipment, etc., TransTexas spokesman Simon Ward said.

This will not delay completion and testing of the well, he added. -- Jim Brumm 212-859-1710.
