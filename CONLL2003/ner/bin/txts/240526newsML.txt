Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp said Friday its board approved a 1997 exploration and development budget of $100 million, a 20 percent increase over last year.

The company said it plans to spend about $34 million in the Sonora Region of West Texas, $28 million in the Mid-Continent Region, $13 million in the Permian Region and $15 million in the Gulf Coast Region.

The remaining $10 million will be used to acquire undeveloped land and conduct seismic survys, the company said.

About 25 percent of the $100 million budget will be used for exploration, the company said.
