U.S. labor official-jobs data show moderate growth.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

A U.S. Labor Department official said the November jobs data continue to show moderate growth in employment.

"Employment continues to grow, although not quite as strongly as it did earlier," Bureau of Labor Statistics senior economist Harvey Hamel told Reuters Financial Television. "It's moderate growth, continued moderate growth."

Hamel said factors such as the Thanksgiving holiday and election-related jobs had no significant impact on the November data, which showed non-farm payrolls growing by a weaker-than-expected 118,000.
