Mild payrolls rescue markets after Greenspan salvo.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

A massive overnight selloff of the dollar and U.S. Treasury securities ended with a surprisingly weak November nonfarm payrolls report, with both markets trimming losses in early trade.

Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan blasted a hole in the financial market bubble, citing "irrational exuberance."

But analysts said the damage should be well contained following news the U.S. economy only created 118,000 new jobs in November.

"Greenspan startled people and what you got was an emotional reaction," said David Hale, at Kemper Financial.  

"The losses will be no more than a few-hour phenomenon, but if we had had this speech and the unemployment rate had gone below five percent, the market would be in serious trouble," said Hale, Kemper's chief economist.

In fact, U.S. unemployment rose to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent, helping allay fears that wage inflation might spark broader price increases in coming months, analysts said.

The Labor Department reported average hourly earnings rose 0.8 percent in November, but officials played down the rise, labelling it "erratic."  

The Treasury bond had fallen more than one full point in early trade, but later rebounded to be near unchanged, standing only 5/32 lower at 0915 EST/1415 GMT.

Likewise, the dollar lost over two pfennigs against the mark after Greenspan's speech, but recovered one pfennig a half-hour after the 0830 EST/1330 GMT payroll report.

"Certainly the report took some of the pressure off. It snatched us from the jaws of doom," said Kevin Lawrie, global foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank.

Still, the U.S. stock market is expected to follow its overseas counterparts lower when it opens at 0930 EST/1430 GMT.  

That could renew pressure on the dollar and Treasuries, traders said.

"It certainly wouldn't help the dollar. But at least payrolls gave us a little time to wait to see how equities open before we decide what to do," Lawrie said.

Speaking in Washington, Greenspan stunned market players with a comment that Fed officials "need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy, its production, jobs and price stability."

When asked recently if asset market inflation concerned him, Greenspan played down its impact, Hale said.  

In addition, other Fed governors have informally agreed not to discuss the stock market in public, Hale added.

That leaves economists to ponder what has changed in Greenspan's view.

"It's an intriguing thing he did. I'm surprised by these comments," Hale added.
