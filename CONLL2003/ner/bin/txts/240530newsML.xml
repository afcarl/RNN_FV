<title>USA: Mild payrolls rescue markets after Greenspan salvo.</title>
<headline>Mild payrolls rescue markets after Greenspan salvo.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>A massive overnight selloff of the dollar and U.S. Treasury securities ended with a surprisingly weak November nonfarm payrolls report, with both markets trimming losses in early trade.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan blasted a hole in the financial market bubble, citing &quot;irrational exuberance.&quot;</p>
<p>But analysts said the damage should be well contained following news the U.S. economy only created 118,000 new jobs in November.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan startled people and what you got was an emotional reaction,&quot; said David Hale, at Kemper Financial.  </p>
<p>&quot;The losses will be no more than a few-hour phenomenon, but if we had had this speech and the unemployment rate had gone below five percent, the market would be in serious trouble,&quot; said Hale, Kemper's chief economist.</p>
<p>In fact, U.S. unemployment rose to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent, helping allay fears that wage inflation might spark broader price increases in coming months, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Labor Department reported average hourly earnings rose 0.8 percent in November, but officials played down the rise, labelling it &quot;erratic.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Treasury bond had fallen more than one full point in early trade, but later rebounded to be near unchanged, standing only 5/32 lower at 0915 EST/1415 GMT.</p>
<p>Likewise, the dollar lost over two pfennigs against the mark after Greenspan's speech, but recovered one pfennig a half-hour after the 0830 EST/1330 GMT payroll report.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly the report took some of the pressure off. It snatched us from the jaws of doom,&quot; said Kevin Lawrie, global foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank.</p>
<p>Still, the U.S. stock market is expected to follow its overseas counterparts lower when it opens at 0930 EST/1430 GMT.  </p>
<p>That could renew pressure on the dollar and Treasuries, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It certainly wouldn't help the dollar. But at least payrolls gave us a little time to wait to see how equities open before we decide what to do,&quot; Lawrie said.</p>
<p>Speaking in Washington, Greenspan stunned market players with a comment that Fed officials &quot;need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy, its production, jobs and price stability.&quot;</p>
<p>When asked recently if asset market inflation concerned him, Greenspan played down its impact, Hale said.  </p>
<p>In addition, other Fed governors have informally agreed not to discuss the stock market in public, Hale added.</p>
<p>That leaves economists to ponder what has changed in Greenspan's view.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an intriguing thing he did. I'm surprised by these comments,&quot; Hale added.</p>
