TVA shuts 1,148 MW Sequoyah nuke in Tenn.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Tennessee Valley Authority shut Friday its Sequoyah 2 nuclear unit in Tennessee due to an electrical problem that resulted in the loss of two reactor coolant pumps, a report filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.

The 1,148 megawatt unit in the town of Soddy-Daisy was operating at full power before the shutdown. The unit was placed in hot shutdown mode early Friday, the report said.

The plant's other 1,148 MW unit, Sequoyah 1, was operating at full capacity.

The TVA, as a matter of policy, declines to comment on operations at its power plants.
