<p>U.S. non-farm payrolls rose less than expected in November, hinting that the economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, analysts said.</p>
<p>But a firm increase in average hourly earnings suggests that the tightness in the labor markets portends possible higher wage inflation next year, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;The data tell us we have moderate growth ... And at the moment low inflation, but there is the potential again for a bit of a pickup next year, a gradual sustained pickup,&quot; said Lee Youngdahl, vice-president at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.  </p>
<p>The Labor Department said on Friday that November non-farm payrolls rose by 118,000 against a revised 224,000 rise in October. The number came in below the market's expectations for a 179,000 increase.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent in the previous month. Analysts had expected the rate would remain unchanged in November.</p>
<p>Average hourly earnings jumped to $11.99 in November against $11.90 in the previous month. &quot;We did get a increase in hourly earnings,&quot; said Michael Niemira, economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.  </p>
<p>&quot;What we might be seeing is kind of a late cycle phenomenon where employment starts to slow and wages start to pick up a little and ultimately (it) could be bad news down the road,&quot; the BTM economist added.</p>
<p>Some analysts said, however, the rise in average hourly earnings must be taken with a grain of salt. Although the nominal index was up in November, they said wages continued to trend down.</p>
<p>&quot;Even given the increase in average hourly earnings, wages and salaries are trending down,&quot; said Kathy Bostjancic, money market analyst at UBS Securities.  </p>
<p>&quot;We had (wage) growth of over 8.7 percent in the second quarter, 6.3 in the third quarter and we're sitting about 4.0 percent or so in the current quarter,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The November employment numbers were not seen as enough reason to prompt the Federal Reserve to change the course of monetary policy in the U.S. in the near future.</p>
<p>Analysts said, however, the report served as a warning to those who are predicting the next Fed move is going to be an easing of interest rates.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think that anybody that was getting the notion that the next Fed move will be an easing should put that on the backburner,&quot; Aubrey's Youngdahl said. &quot;These wage numbers clearly do not point toward that eventuality.&quot;</p>
<p>The employment report, one of the most closely watched economic indicators on Wall Street, also played a role in the financial markets on Friday.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury market, which had dropped sharply overnight after some comments by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, pared some of its losses after the payroll report release.</p>
<p>The 6-1/2 percent benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was quoted down 20/32 at 99-09/32, after falling about 1-11/32 at the opening on Friday. Its yield was at 6.54 percent.</p>
<p>U.S. stock prices opened down after Greenspan's remarks, which included a warning against exuberance in U.S. asset markets. The Dow Jones Industrials were down well over 100 points in early trade.</p>
