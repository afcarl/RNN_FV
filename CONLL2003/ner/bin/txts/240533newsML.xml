<title>USA: US expert sees above-average '97 hurricane season.</title>
<headline>US expert sees above-average '97 hurricane season.</headline>

<p>A hurricane forecaster said Friday he expected the 1997 Atlantic hurricane season to be busier than average, with 11 tropical storms, of which seven would intensify into hurricanes and three would become major storms.</p>
<p>But William Gray, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University with a record of accurately predicting hurricane activity, said even an average season would make the three years ending in 1997 the busiest three years on record.</p>
<p>In an average season there are 9.3 tropical storms, of which seven become hurricanes -- with maximum sustained winds of 74 mph (119 kph) or higher -- and 2.1 intense hurricanes of Category 3 or higher. Category 3 storms have maximum sustained winds of 111 mph (179 kph) or higher.</p>
<p>There were 32 named storms in 1995 and 1996 combined, with 19 in 1995 making that year the busiest in six decades. There were 13 tropical storms in the 1996 season that ended last week, of which nine became hurricanes, six of them reaching Category 3 or higher.</p>
<p>Gray, who has been issuing hurricane season predictions for 14 years, bases his forecasts on a complicated analysis of world weather patterns, including ocean temperature and surface pressure, wind patterns and rainfall, as well as analysis of past years' storm activity.</p>
