New England Patriots said in deal for stadium.

BOSTON 1996-12-06

The owner of the New England Patriots football team, Robert Kraft, and Massachusetts Port Authority officials are close to reaching a $500,000-a-year deal to build a football stadium in South Boston, the Boston Herald reported Friday.

Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper reported the "secret deal" would provide a $1 million mitigation payment to the city and include state financing for roads and parking.

Kraft plans to build a $200 million, privately financed stadium on the site and pay $500,000 annually to MassPort to lease land near the Marine Industrial Park which the agency owns, the Herald said.

Boston Mayor Thomas Menino has said his top priority for the city is a convention center, not a stadium.

The authority's bonds are AA by Standard & Poor's Corp and and Moody's Investors Service.

Officials from MassPort and the Patriots were not immediately available for comment.
