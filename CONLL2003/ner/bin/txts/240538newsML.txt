Northwest to buy back up to 5 mln shares.

MINNEAPOLIS 1996-12-06

Northwest Airlines Corp said Friday its board had approved a program to buy back up to five million shares of Class A common stock.  

The repurchases will occur from time to time in the open market or through negotiated transactions, the airline said.

Shares repurchased under the program would offset dilution resulting from the exercise of employee stock options, the company said.

As of October 31, Northwest had 97,384,551 common shares outstanding (111,939,559 on a fully distributed and diluted basis), the company said.
