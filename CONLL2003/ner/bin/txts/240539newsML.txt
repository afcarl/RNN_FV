Maine Yankee shuts 910 MW nuclear unit for repairs.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

The Maine Yankee nuclear plant in Wiscasset, Maine, was manually shut late Thursday for electrical repairs, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said in its daily report.  

Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co declared both sets of the plant's manual reactor trip push buttons inoperable because they did not meet technical specifications though they were functional, NRC said Friday.

The company at 2047 EST began placing the plant in hot shutdown to make repairs, NRC said.

Hot shutdown means the plant is prepared for restart within a short period of time.

The 910 megawatt generating station has been running at 90 percent of capacity while the NRC inspected results of safety test on the emergency core cooling system.

Maine Yankee is 38 percent owned by Central Maine Power, 20 percent each by New England Electric System and Northeast Utilities, and 22 percent by other New England utilities.
