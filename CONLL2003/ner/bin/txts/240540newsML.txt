INSTANT VIEW-Jobs data seen calming US stock open.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

A government report that U.S. monthly jobs data did not show any signs of inflation was expected to relieve fears that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates.

Comments on inflation and the markets made by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan late Thursday sparked fears which sent world financial markets tumbling.

November nonfarm Payrolls increased by 118,000. Economists had expected payrolls to increase by 179,000 in November.  

THOM BROWN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, RUTHERFORD BROWN AND CATHERWOOD:

"I think the jobs are going to cool off some of this wild fear generated by Greenspan's remarks last night ... It's a very encouraging sign.

"There's a lot of concerns, especially in futures markets, about the sharp selloff in foreign markets. But that concern is unwarranted as it relates to the American market for few reasons.  

"The European markets are much more overvalued. And this market here has been classically overbought and needs to have a little bit of reason sprinkled on it once in a while.

"Greenspan simply did that. I don't think what he implied was anything other than the Fed was watching over this speculative market."

The long bond rebounded from earlier lows when if was off over a point. The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond was off 18/32 to yield 6.55 percent.  

ALAN ACKERMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, FAHNESTOCK AND CO

"Bonds may bounce a bit as a result of the jobs numbers but Greenspan's comments appear to be the key factor... (The comments) appear to have reignited inflation and rate fears.
