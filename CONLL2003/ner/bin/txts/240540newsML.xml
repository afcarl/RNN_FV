<p>A government report that U.S. monthly jobs data did not show any signs of inflation was expected to relieve fears that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates.</p>
<p>Comments on inflation and the markets made by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan late Thursday sparked fears which sent world financial markets tumbling.</p>
<p>November nonfarm Payrolls increased by 118,000. Economists had expected payrolls to increase by 179,000 in November.  </p>
<p>THOM BROWN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, RUTHERFORD BROWN AND CATHERWOOD:</p>
<p>&quot;I think the jobs are going to cool off some of this wild fear generated by Greenspan's remarks last night ... It's a very encouraging sign.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of concerns, especially in futures markets, about the sharp selloff in foreign markets. But that concern is unwarranted as it relates to the American market for few reasons.  </p>
<p>&quot;The European markets are much more overvalued. And this market here has been classically overbought and needs to have a little bit of reason sprinkled on it once in a while.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan simply did that. I don't think what he implied was anything other than the Fed was watching over this speculative market.&quot;</p>
<p>The long bond rebounded from earlier lows when if was off over a point. The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond was off 18/32 to yield 6.55 percent.  </p>
<p>ALAN ACKERMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, FAHNESTOCK AND CO</p>
<p>&quot;Bonds may bounce a bit as a result of the jobs numbers but Greenspan's comments appear to be the key factor... (The comments) appear to have reignited inflation and rate fears.</p>
