U.S. Treasury prices opened sharply lower on Friday after remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments in Washington, D.C. on Thursday evening sent world stock and bond markets tumbling overnight.

Greenspan said "irrational exuberance" in asset markets could damage the economy and, in his lecture to the American Enterprise Institute, said, "Evaluating shifts in balance sheets generally, and in asset prices particularly, must be an integral part of the development of monetary policy."  

The Greenspan comments, which recognized that recent U.S. inflation trends had been low but added that the future course of inflation was uncertain, revived fears about the outlook for interest rates and inflation through 1997, analysts said.

"The Fed did not want to tighten, but it didn't want the market to ease for them," said Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at I.D.E.A. "The market got some soft data for the third quarter and extrapolated that for the fourth quarter and beyond, which was a little presumptuous."

The comments came on the eve of the closely watched U.S. employment report.  

The Labor Department's November employment report is expected to show that payrolls expanded by 179,000 jobs during the month, according to a Reuters poll. The unemployment rate is expected to stay steady at 5.2 percent. The average workweek length is expected to be up to 34.4 hours from 34.3 hours in October.

Some players speculated that the Fed Chairman's wary comments on the financial asset markets' recent exuberance may have been a hint that the November U.S. employment report would be stronger than expected.  

"We're all still trying to get a handle on (the situation)," said one trader.

The benchmark 30-year bond was down 1-12/32 to 98-17/32, its yield having soared to 6.61 percent.

"You have to move your trading ranges out. Your technical levels," said Stiles. "If the market gets a weak employment number, and we rally to 6.50 percent (on the 30-year bond yield), that would be tough resistance right now. And we do look at some technical support in the contract at 111-23, which is around 6.66 percent in the 30-year bond yield."  

"It's tough trying to get into the mind of the Fed Chairman," said Kevin Flanagan, first vice president and money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds. "It would appear he had the employment report going into the speech. He must feel there's too much in the way of asset appreciation. The question is what was he trying to tell us. Was he trying to get in front of the curve because it's going to be a very strong employment report or was he trying to let a little air out of the balloon because it was getting too tight and he doesn't want it to pop."  

"The bottom line is he feels asset values have gotten too high and he was trying to prick the bubble a little bit," said Flanagan.

In early trade before the employment number, the two-year note was down 4/32 to 99-22/32, yielding 5.79 percent. Five-year notes were down 13/32 to 99-4/32, yielding 6.08 percent. Ten-year notes were down 28/32 to 101-4/32, yielding 6.34 percent.

Three-month bill rates were down four basis points to 4.91 percent. Six-month and year-bill rates were up two and three basis points, respectively, to 5.05 and 5.20 percent.
