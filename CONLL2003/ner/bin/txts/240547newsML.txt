Sundstrand's Sullair in restructuring talks.

ROCKFORD, Ill. 1996-12-06

Sundstrand Corp said Friday its Sullair Europe unit had started talks with its employees for a restructuring that would result in a pretax, fourth quarter charge of $32 million.

Additional costs of $3 million may be seen in 1997, but those costs should be offset by related savings, the company said.

The restructuring is expected to reduce operating cash flow by about $10 million in 1997, it said.

"Our European compressor business has not been profitable for several years as a result of depressed market conditions and strong competitive pressures," said Sundstrand Chief Executive Robert Jenkins.

"However, we remain dedicated to the European market and believe that after making the restructuring adjustments, Sullair Europe will be a viable business which will meet our strategic objectives in the European compressor markets," Jenkins said.

Sundstrand, with 1995 sales of $1.5 billion, makes components and subsystems for aerospace markets.
