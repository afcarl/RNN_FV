<p>U.S. stocks are expected to open sharply lower after warnings by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that stock prices could be overvalued sent world financial markets reeling.</p>
<p>Greenspan, who made the comment during a lecture in Washington Thursday night, stopped short of directly referring to the recent sharp rally in stocks but analysts expressed little doubt about the impact of his message.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't look good,&quot; said Hildegard Zagorski, market analyst at Prudential Securities.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think what happened is Greenspan is trying to talk the market down,&quot; she said. &quot;The (Dow's) going down 100 points.&quot;</p>
<p>Greenspan said the Fed must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stock and other asset markets. He also rekindled concern about interest rates by alluding to the need for the Fed to anticipate inflation because of the lagging effect of rate changes on the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;It means that we often need to tighten or ease before the need for action is evident to the public at large...,&quot; he said. While inflation has been low, he said, &quot;its future course remains uncertain.&quot;  </p>
<p>Greenspan's comments hit markets that were already keenly sensitive about inflation risks. A critical inflation indicator, the November jobs report, is scheduled for release at 0830 EST/1330 GMT.</p>
<p>Economists expect payrolls increased by 179,000 last month, compared to a 210,000 increase in October. Average hourly earnings are forecast to rise by 0.4 percent, compared to no change in October. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 5.2 percent.</p>
<p>Jitters about a surprise in the jobs report were cited as contributing to yesterday's sharp sell-off in the bond market.  </p>
<p>Markets around the world skidded lower on the Greenspan comments. In Tokyo the Nikkei-225 index fell 667 points, or 3.2 percent, to 20,277.</p>
<p>U.S. shares were broadly lower in London and the FTSE-100 slumped 139.5 points, or 3.4 percent, to 3911.7.</p>
<p>The dollar also buckled under the pressure, falling two pfennigs against the mark and slipping to just above 112 yen.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries continued their tumble, falling 1-10/32 to yield 6.61 percent.</p>
<p>The December S&amp;P 500 index future fell the 12-point limit to 733.35, indicating a 100-point Dow decline at the open.  </p>
<p>The New York Times's Marketplace column reports on the Securities and Exchange Commission's expulsion of Stratton Oakmont from the securities industry.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column writes that several mutual funds have been selling H&amp;R Block because of losses at CompuServe. However, some analysts like the growth prospects of the firm's tax business, according to the column.</p>
