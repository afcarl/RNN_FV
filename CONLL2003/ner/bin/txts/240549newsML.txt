NPS Pharmaceuticals adopts rights plan.

SALT LAKE CITY 1996-12-06

NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc said Friday it adopted a shareholder rights plan, designed to protect the long-term value of shareholders' investments in NPS by guarding against coercive or unfair takeover attempts.

The plan provides that one preferred stock purchase right, which represents the right to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Preferred Stock, will be distributed as a non-taxable dividend for each share of NPS common stock held of record at the close of business on December 31, 1996.

The rights, which will initially trade with the common stock, become exercisable if a third party acquires 20 percent or announces its intention to tender for at least 20 percent or more of NPS's common stock.

The Rights expire on December 31, 2001.

The company said that adoption of the plan was not a response to any current attempt or proposal to acquire a controlling interest in NPS.
