Mutual funds frownon H&R Block - WSJ.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

A lot of mutual funds have dumped the stock of tax preparer H&R Block, pushing the price down to 30-5/8 now from a 52-week high of 44-3/4, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

The funds see the Kansas City, Mo., company as the victim of the Internet, the story says. The growth story has gone up in smoke at its 80.1 percent owned CompuServe on-line subsidiary, which last month posted steep losses and a big write off, and scrapped a fledgling on-line service aimed at families, the story says.

One disappointed seller cited by the Journal is Richard Rubinstein, manager of $1 billion in assets including the Oppenheimer Fund, who bailed out "three or four months ago."

With CompuServe in the dumps, he told the newspaper, "the basic tax business at H&R Block never had much appeal to me."
