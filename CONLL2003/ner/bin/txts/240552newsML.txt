Calif. lawmaker proposes balanced budget amendment.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. 1996-12-05

California state Assemblyman Jan Goldsmith said on Thursday he had introduced a constitutional amendment to require the state Legislature to pass a balanced budget.

The balanced budget amendment, the first proposed constitutional amendment of the 1997-1998 legislative session, would also require the state Department of Finance to asses projected revenues and budget shortfalls and the state Legislative Analyst to verify the findings.

"This legislation codifies our commitment to a balanced budget in the Constitution," said Goldsmith, a Republican from San Diego. "It is the foundation of fiscal responsibility."

With only days remaining in the 1995-1996 legislative session, the Assembly passed Goldsmith's earlier balanced budget amendment. The session ended, however, before the measure could be heard on the Senate side.

There is currently no provision in California's Constitution to require the Legislature to send a balanced budget to the governor for signature.
