<title>USA: Organized crime seen in US small-cap trade -report.</title>
<headline>Organized crime seen in US small-cap trade -report.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-05</dateline>

<p>A three-month investigation has revealed the presence of organized crime in the small-capitalization stock market, according to the cover story of the December 16 issue of BusinessWeek.</p>
<p>According to the story, traders affiliated with organized crime manipulate stocks by driving up share prices and then unloading them on the public through hard-sell cold-calling. Sometimes, they sell the shares short to profit when the price falls.</p>
<p>Particularly susceptible are initial public offerings, the article suggests.  </p>
<p>The article says that four U.S. organized crime families as well as Russian criminals either directly own or control about two dozen brokerage firms that make markets in hundreds of stocks.</p>
<p>They often use intimidation tactics, including violence, to make traders and brokers toe the line.</p>
<p>The article names Philip Abramo as the &quot;ranking reputed underworld chieftain&quot; who allegedly controls at least four brokerages through frontmen and has influence over others.</p>
<p>Criminal inroads seem confined to stocks that trade over-the-counter or in the Nasdaq small-cap markets, according to the article, which names a wide range of stocks that it says have been manipulated by mobsters.  </p>
<p>The article says that officials of the companies deny knowledge of irregularities, and there was no evidence that the managements were in cahoots with stock manipulators.</p>
<p>According to the article, the response of regulators to alleged activity &quot;has been mixed at best.&quot;  Law enforcement officers have tended to ignore complaints of intimidation, it says.</p>
<p>A sidebar to the main story quotes Massood Gilani, who worked in the Special Investigations Unit of the New York office of the National Association of Securities Dealers until he was fired in 1995. Gilani told the magazine that the NASD did not heed customer complaints that might have tipped it off to the alleged influence of organized crime at Hanover Sterling &amp; Co, which subsequently went out of business.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Nasdaq, when contacted by Reuters, said that the association was not immediately familiar with the article and therefore could not comment at this time.</p>
