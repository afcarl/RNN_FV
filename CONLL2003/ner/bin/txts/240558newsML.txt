SEC has no comment on NYSE circuit-breakers action.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-05

The Securities and Exchange Commission said Thursday it has no comment on an action by the New York Stock Exchange increasing the trigger points for market-wide circuit breakers.

The Big Board's action was announced so late in the day that the agency could not immediately comment, said SEC spokeswoman Jennifer Scardino.

The NYSE's action calls for a half-hour trading halt across all U.S. equities and futures markets if the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls 350 points from the previous day's close and a one-hour halt at minus 550 points.

The current levels are 250 and 400 points, respectively.
