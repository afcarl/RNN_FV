Fed's Broaddus says risks in U.S. economy balanced.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-05

Alfred Broaddus, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said the economic risks in the U.S. were "reasonably well balanced."

In an interview on the Public Broadcasting Service's "Nightly Business Report," Broaddus was asked whether he agreed with concerns expressed earlier Thursday by Fed Governor Laurence Lindsey about high levels of consumer debt.

Broaddus said the debt levels were a "significant risk" but added that overall the risks appeared balanced.  

On the upside, Broaddus pointed out that Americans' incomes were growing, jobs were growing, mortgage rates had fallen and that consumer confidence was up.

Asked whether the low unemployment rate of 5.2 percent posed a risk of wage inflation, the Richmond Fed chief said, "We are seeing signs of very tight labor markets. We have some isolated instances of increased wages."

However, he said the wage rises were "not very general yet," and he added that such increases would not necessarily lead to inflation so long as productivity was growing at a healthy rate.  

The Fed official was also questioned about his definition of price stability. He reiterated a definition often given by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan -- it was a condition in which inflation was no longer a factor in day-to-day economic decisions.

Asked whether the current 3 percent inflation rate constituted stable prices, Broaddus said it would be if people were confident that it could be sustained but he added that when people see a 3 percent inflation rate they may suspect that it could go higher.

"That's why it's important to bring (inflation) down to something we can refer to concretely as price stability," he said.

Concerning the pace at which the goal should be achieved, Broaddus said, "It is a condition we want to get to gradually and maintain."
