<p>Alfred Broaddus, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said the economic risks in the U.S. were &quot;reasonably well balanced.&quot;</p>
<p>In an interview on the Public Broadcasting Service's &quot;Nightly Business Report,&quot; Broaddus was asked whether he agreed with concerns expressed earlier Thursday by Fed Governor Laurence Lindsey about high levels of consumer debt.</p>
<p>Broaddus said the debt levels were a &quot;significant risk&quot; but added that overall the risks appeared balanced.  </p>
<p>On the upside, Broaddus pointed out that Americans' incomes were growing, jobs were growing, mortgage rates had fallen and that consumer confidence was up.</p>
<p>Asked whether the low unemployment rate of 5.2 percent posed a risk of wage inflation, the Richmond Fed chief said, &quot;We are seeing signs of very tight labor markets. We have some isolated instances of increased wages.&quot;</p>
<p>However, he said the wage rises were &quot;not very general yet,&quot; and he added that such increases would not necessarily lead to inflation so long as productivity was growing at a healthy rate.  </p>
<p>The Fed official was also questioned about his definition of price stability. He reiterated a definition often given by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan -- it was a condition in which inflation was no longer a factor in day-to-day economic decisions.</p>
<p>Asked whether the current 3 percent inflation rate constituted stable prices, Broaddus said it would be if people were confident that it could be sustained but he added that when people see a 3 percent inflation rate they may suspect that it could go higher.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why it's important to bring (inflation) down to something we can refer to concretely as price stability,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Concerning the pace at which the goal should be achieved, Broaddus said, &quot;It is a condition we want to get to gradually and maintain.&quot;</p>
