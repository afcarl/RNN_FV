Texas Petrochemicals idles unit, trims MTBE output.

HOUSTON 1996-12-05

Texas Petrochemicals Corp on Thursday idled one of two dehydro units at its Houston manufacturing plant in a move that will cut its production of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) to 13,000 barrels per day, a spokesman said.

The plant, located east of Houston on the ship channel, has a rated capacity to produce 25,000 barrels per day of MTBE, a gasoline additive, he said.

The dehydro unit was idled in reaction to rising feedstock costs for isobutane and methanol and declining prices for MTBE, he said.
