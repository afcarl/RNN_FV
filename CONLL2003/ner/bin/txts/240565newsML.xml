<p>The Federal Reserve must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stock and other asset markets because that could end up doing damage to the economy, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a lecture to a dinner meeting of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, Greenspan stopped short of commenting on the recent steep run-up in Wall Street prices.</p>
<p>But the central bank chief made clear that the Fed needed to factor the activities of bears and bulls on Wall Street into its deliberations on interest rates.  </p>
<p>&quot;Evaluating shifts in balance sheets generally, and in asset prices particularly, must be an integral part of the development of monetary policy,&quot; Greenspan said.</p>
<p>Blue chip share prices have soared 25 percent this year, leading some analysts to worry that the market may be setting itself up for a crash that could cripple the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;We as central bankers need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy, its production, jobs and price stability,&quot; Greenspan said. &quot;Indeed, the sharp stock market break of 1987 had few negative consequences for the economy.&quot;  </p>
<p>But he quickly added that the central bank could not afford to underestimate or become complacent about the complex links between the prices of such assets as stock and real estate and the economy.</p>
<p>It is not clear what, if anything, the Fed can do if it fears that the financial markets have gotten ahead of themselves and are setting themselves up for crash.</p>
<p>If the central bank decides to raise interest rates to cool off speculative fervor, it risks triggering the very collapse it is seeking to avoid, analysts said.  </p>
<p>The Fed holds its next policy-making meeting on December 17 and is widely expected to opt to hold interest rates steady amid signs of moderate economic growth with steady inflation.</p>
<p>Greenspan said that inflation has been low, but added that its &quot;future course remains uncertain.&quot;</p>
<p>Labor markets are tight but product markets are, in Greenspan's words, &quot;comfortable&quot; -- an apparent allusion to the lack of shortages. That is a combination with &quot;scant historic precedent,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Because interest rate changes work on the economy with a lag, the Fed needs to be forward looking in setting policy, taking action before dangers develop, Greenspan said.</p>
<p>&quot;It means that often we need to tighten or ease before the need for action is evident to the public at large, and that policy may have to reverse course from time to time as the underlying forces acting on the economy shift,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>That can prove puzzling to the public, whose support, he said, is needed for the Fed to pursue its goals of maximum employment, sustainable economic growth and price stability.  </p>
<p>The central bank is not helped in winning public backing for its actions by what Greenspan called the &quot;misperception&quot; that it is a &quot;secretive organization.&quot;</p>
<p>To help correct that, the Fed is looking to expand the flow of information to the public, he added.</p>
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the central bank was able to use easily-explainable movements in the money supply as a guide to the future direction of policy and the economy. But the relationship between the money supply and the economy broke down in the 1990s, leaving the Fed rudderless.  </p>
<p>Greenspan saw &quot;some indications&quot; that that relationship may be coming back on track. But, he added, &quot;It is too soon to tell, and in any event we cannot in the future expect to rely a great deal on money supply in making monetary policy.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fed's task has not been made any easier by the increasing difficultly statisticians face in measuring inflation and thus in pinning down exactly what constitutes price stability, the Fed chairman said.</p>
<p>A Congressionally-appointed commission this week concluded that the most popular measure of inflation -- the consumer price index -- overstates the cost of living by 1.1 percentage points per year.</p>
<p>At that same time it is pursuing price stability, the Fed also needs to maintain the stability of the financial system and head off destabilizing crises, Greenspan said.</p>
<p>He identified the &quot;rapidly mushrooming payments system as the most vulnerable area of potential danger&quot; in that regard.</p>
