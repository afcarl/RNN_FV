ServiceMaster expects to complete buy in Q1.

CHICAGO 1996-12-05

ServiceMaster LP's $230 million acquisition of Barefoot Inc faces several steps, but the transaction is expected to be completed late in the first quarter of 1997, ServiceMaster said.

Before its $16 a share tender offer begins, the proposed transaction must pass Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust approval, shares must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and ServiceMaster must complete a due dilligence process.

Holders of at least 75 percent of Barefoot's 14.5 million outstanding shares also need to give their approval.

"Assuming all goes well, we should close late in the first quarter," Claire Buchan, vice president-communications, told Reuters in a telephone interview.

Buchan said Barefoot, the No. 2 lawn care company, would complement ServiceMaster's industry leading TrueGreen-ChemLawn lawn care business, which in 1995 had a 26 percent market share.

ServiceMaster has not decided whether it will maintain the Barefoot name. "We're looking at ways to see how to capitalize on that," Buchan said.

Buchan said many of the markets the two companies serve overlap, and the proposed combination would lead to increased efficiency, improved customer service and "the capitaliation of an expanded market opportunity."

By having Barefoot in its fold, ServiceMaster also would be in a position to expand services to Barefoot customers, Buchan noted. ServiceMaster owns a pest control, residential maid service and home inspection and warranty businesses.

ServiceMaster's stock ended at 28-3/8, off 1/4. Barefoot rose 2-19/32 to 15-11/32.
