<p>ServiceMaster LP's $230 million acquisition of Barefoot Inc faces several steps, but the transaction is expected to be completed late in the first quarter of 1997, ServiceMaster said.</p>
<p>Before its $16 a share tender offer begins, the proposed transaction must pass Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust approval, shares must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and ServiceMaster must complete a due dilligence process.</p>
<p>Holders of at least 75 percent of Barefoot's 14.5 million outstanding shares also need to give their approval.</p>
<p>&quot;Assuming all goes well, we should close late in the first quarter,&quot; Claire Buchan, vice president-communications, told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Buchan said Barefoot, the No. 2 lawn care company, would complement ServiceMaster's industry leading TrueGreen-ChemLawn lawn care business, which in 1995 had a 26 percent market share.</p>
<p>ServiceMaster has not decided whether it will maintain the Barefoot name. &quot;We're looking at ways to see how to capitalize on that,&quot; Buchan said.</p>
<p>Buchan said many of the markets the two companies serve overlap, and the proposed combination would lead to increased efficiency, improved customer service and &quot;the capitaliation of an expanded market opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>By having Barefoot in its fold, ServiceMaster also would be in a position to expand services to Barefoot customers, Buchan noted. ServiceMaster owns a pest control, residential maid service and home inspection and warranty businesses.</p>
<p>ServiceMaster's stock ended at 28-3/8, off 1/4. Barefoot rose 2-19/32 to 15-11/32.</p>
