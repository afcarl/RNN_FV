GM begins Calif. showroom sales of electric cars.

After successfully battling California's plan to mandate sales of electric vehicles as of 1998, General Motors Corp. Thursday became the first major automaker to market the cars to retail consumers.

GM's EV1 -- a two-seater with a sticker price near $35,000 -- is now offered for lease at Saturn dealerships in southern California and Arizona.

Despite the high sticker price, Saturn dealers in California, the nation's biggest car market, said initial customer response has been positive.

"The place is a madhouse. We have five customers taking delivery of the cars today," said a salesperson at a Saturn dealership in Los Angeles on Thursday, adding many customers view the sleek EV1 as a good second car because of the limited driving range limitations -- about 70 miles in the city and 90 on the highway.

"I think there is going to be a period of learning how the market develops for the first few years," said Robert Hayden, executive director of the Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas (EVAA). "Particularly for battery technology."

GM, which first unveiled the electric car in 1989, said it has received more than 3,000 inquiries about the cars since the sales plan was announced in January. But it remains to be seen if the sleek-looking two-seater which GM originally called the Impact, will be a hit with consumers.

Nevertheless, electric vehicle supporters say electric power will be the transportation fuel of the future, based on superior performance and affordability, particularly when mass production kicks to lower manufacturing costs.

For example, utilities claim cars charged overnight, when power demand and prices are lower, would cost about $20 a month to fuel, compared with $50 to $60 a month for a comparable gasoline-powered car.

In addition, the EV1 requires no engine tune-ups or other maintenance associated with the internal combustion engine, thereby reducing ownership costs.

The two other major U.S. automakers, Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co, plan to begin retail marketing of electric-powered vans and trucks by early 1998. Both will use lead-acid batteries similar to those GM is using.

Japanese automakers Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and Toyota Motor Corp. plan to market electric vehicles in the U.S. with longer-range nickel-metal hydride batteries late this year or early next year. Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. plans to use lithium-ion batteries in its commercial EV.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) earlier this year put off requiring sales of no-emission vehicles until 2003, when 10 percent of all cars for sale in the smog-plagued state will have to meet those requirements.

Currently, only vehicles powered by electricity meet the noe-emission standards.

GM, along with other major automakers and the petroleum industry, lobbied aggressively for the delay in the state mandate, arguing that technology limitations made the sale of EVs impractical.

Environmentalists, consumer advocates and electric utilities were disappointed by CARB's decision to relax the no-emisson rules.

But the Berkeley, Calif.-based Union of Concerned Scientists this week applauded GM "for breaking out of the mold of gas-powered combustion engines."

Southern California Edison Co., the electric utility, subsidiary of Edison International, is the primary fuel supplier for the new autos.

Edison spokesman Paul Klein said more than a dozen Edison customers would take delivery of GM's EV1 on Thursday.
