ADR REPORT - ADRs plunge in New York trade.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Foreign shares plunged in New York on Friday following anti-inflation comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

"It was just panic. That's the word -- panic," said one trader in American Depositary Receipts (ADRs).

He added, "Just pick a stock. Everything is down three, four, five percent."

Decliners swamped advancers 10 to one in an index of 807 ADRs. Volume was a strong 32.7 million shares in late morning.  

Greenspan warned late on Thursday that the U.S. central bank had to beware of "irrational exuberance" in stock and asset markets. New York markets plummeted on the comments.

Among major European stocks, Royal Dutch Petroleum Co was off 2-1/4 to 164-1/2 and Unilever NV fell 3-3/8 to 166.

Brazilian telephone company Telebras dropped 2-1/8 to 76-5/8 after a strong rise in recent days and ahead of mid-December's options and futures settlements.  

Canadian oil company Arakis Energy Corp was the volume leader among ADRs. Its shares fell 3/16 to 5-3/8 with 2.7 million shares traded.
