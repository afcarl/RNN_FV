DUTCH SHARES END NIGHTMARE SESSION WAY ABOVE LOWS.

1535 GMT - Dutch shares were sent into free fall by comments

from Fed chairman Alan Greenspan only to rebound sharply on

bargain hunting triggered by better than expected U.S. November

jobs numbers and a controlled early fall on Wall Street.

* AEX closes 12.18 points or 1.94 percent lower at 616.26,

slashing back an earlier 38.71 point drop to 589.73 as spooked

Dutch investors took the view that Greenspan's remarks meant the

Fed was more likely to raise interest rates than cut them.

Feeling that the early falls were overdone and moves by

investors to buy into dips helped index carve back the early

losses, but dealers say Wall St close will set Monday's tone.

Dealers said the overall feeling on Friday was that Greenspan's remarks triggered a much-needed consolidation and that, although chart formations pointed to potential losses back to 550-560, the underlying bull market remained in place.

One chart analyst said today's fall fitted with a pattern of corrections seen late in 1995 and earlier this year when the market retreated only to recover strongly.

"We saw the AEX go to 440 from 480 late last year and to 510 from 570 in the summer -- both of them very fast, steep corrections. This could be one of those as well," he said, adding all his charts showed rising patterns.

One analyst expressed scepticism about the falls early in the session. He said Greenspan's remarks about "irrational exuberance" in financial markets reminded him of the 1920s when people were borrowing money to put into stock markets.

"He might be afraid of that but I'm not seeing it, nothing of the kind, it's not the way European or Dutch people are buying stocks," he said.

"Sure we're going to have a shakeout but let all the panic sellers come, because I know some buyers. Those panic sellers around now are the same people who are going to buy back stock when the index is back around 625," he said.
