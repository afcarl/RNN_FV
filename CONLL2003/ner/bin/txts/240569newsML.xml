<title>NETHERLANDS: DUTCH SHARES END NIGHTMARE SESSION WAY ABOVE LOWS.</title>
<headline>DUTCH SHARES END NIGHTMARE SESSION WAY ABOVE LOWS.</headline>
<text>
<p>1535 GMT - Dutch shares were sent into free fall by comments</p>
<p>from Fed chairman Alan Greenspan only to rebound sharply on</p>
<p>bargain hunting triggered by better than expected U.S. November</p>
<p>jobs numbers and a controlled early fall on Wall Street.</p>
<p>* AEX closes 12.18 points or 1.94 percent lower at 616.26,</p>
<p>slashing back an earlier 38.71 point drop to 589.73 as spooked</p>
<p>Dutch investors took the view that Greenspan's remarks meant the</p>
<p>Fed was more likely to raise interest rates than cut them.</p>
<p>Feeling that the early falls were overdone and moves by</p>
<p>investors to buy into dips helped index carve back the early</p>
<p>losses, but dealers say Wall St close will set Monday's tone.</p>
<p>Dealers said the overall feeling on Friday was that Greenspan's remarks triggered a much-needed consolidation and that, although chart formations pointed to potential losses back to 550-560, the underlying bull market remained in place.</p>
<p>One chart analyst said today's fall fitted with a pattern of corrections seen late in 1995 and earlier this year when the market retreated only to recover strongly.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw the AEX go to 440 from 480 late last year and to 510 from 570 in the summer -- both of them very fast, steep corrections. This could be one of those as well,&quot; he said, adding all his charts showed rising patterns.</p>
<p>One analyst expressed scepticism about the falls early in the session. He said Greenspan's remarks about &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in financial markets reminded him of the 1920s when people were borrowing money to put into stock markets.</p>
<p>&quot;He might be afraid of that but I'm not seeing it, nothing of the kind, it's not the way European or Dutch people are buying stocks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure we're going to have a shakeout but let all the panic sellers come, because I know some buyers. Those panic sellers around now are the same people who are going to buy back stock when the index is back around 625,&quot; he said.</p>
