ATHENS 1996-12-06

The Athens stock exchange sought

the advice of the capital markets commission on whether to

approve a share capital increase of textiles firm Magrizos

whose shares have been suspended from trading.

The bourse had said in a press release on Thursday that

"shareholders of Magrizos were implicated in the recent Delta

Securities scandal."

In a subsequent press release on Friday it said its

statement referred to specific individuals and their respective

holdings of Magrizos shares based on the company's general

assembly of shareholders on October 9 1996.

The individuals and their stakes were the following:

    Panagiotis Tryfon     6.95 percent

    Dimitris Argyriadis   4.17 percent

    Agelos Dikos	    2.08 percent

    Demosthenes Tzanis    4.17 percent

    Spyridon Giasafakis   2.08 percent

Based on the October 9 shareholders meeting records, all of

the above were represented in the assembly by Nina Magrizos, the

bourse said.
