SABENA IN MAINTENANCE DEAL WITH FEDEX.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

Belgian airline Sabena said its technics division signed a six-year contract on Friday with U.S. express freight carrier Federal Express for the maintenance of a number of engines on its Boeing 727 planes.

Sabena Technics will carry out maintenance of Pratt & Whitney JT8D engines, which have been installed on about 160 Boeing 727 planes of Memphis-based FedEx.

"It's less than half (the total number) but still a considerable share of them," a Sabena spokesman said. He declined to give financial details of the contract.  

"The contract with FedEx is part of the strategy of Sabena Technics to further develop its Engines department and strengthen its position in the U.S. market," Sabena said in a statement.

"It also offers a good basis to carry out other activities for FedEx such as maintenance of components (Boeing 727 and Airbus A300-600 and A310) and other types of engines (Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4).

Sabena Technics employs 2,500 people at Brussels' Zaventem airport. Two thirds of its activities are carried out for companies other than Sabena and its subsidiary Sobelair.
