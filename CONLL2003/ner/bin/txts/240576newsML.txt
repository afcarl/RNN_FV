PETROFINA STAGES DOWNWARD CORRECTION.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

Shares in Belgian oil and chemicals company Petrofina fell sharply on an already weaker Brussels bourse on Friday in a downward correction after a week of gains, but analysts were optimistic for the longer term.

The dollar-sensitive share had fallen 5.4 percent to 10,100 francs by 1210 GMT, erasing the previous session's rise, with 37,124 shares changing hands.

"The fastest rises are the fastest fallers," said one analyst. Others said the stock had risen for four days in a row after investors considered it looked undervalued and amid expectations of a strong performance in the oil sector for 1997.  

"We believe the share deserves a premium as the company is better positioned than its competitors in the refining sector (75 percent of sales)," Belgian brokerage Vermeulen Raemdonck said in a research note.
