ATHENS 1996-12-06

One-year forex forwards fell 35 forward points after Greek consumer price inflation fell to an unexpected 7.7 percent year-on-year in November from 8.3 percent in October, said dealers.

"One-year forex forwards dropped 35 forward points after the November CPI data," a senior foreign bank dealer told Reuters. "They are trading at 1365/80 from 1400/1450 at open, a drop of 20 basis points in implied drachma rates."

Traders said they expected the central bank to cut its overnight intervention rate by as much as 50 basis points today.

The Bank of Greece's overnight intervention offer stands currently at 13.40 percent.

About 100 million ecus were bought by banks at the fixing and ecu/drachma firmed to 303.95 on Friday from 303.750 on Thursday, dealers said. --Dimitris Kontogiannis, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4
