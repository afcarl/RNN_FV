GREEK STATE UTILITIES TO SIGN LONG-TERM DEALS.

ATHENS 1996-12-06

Greek Development Minister Vasso Papandreou submitted an amendment to parliament that allows state utilities to sign long-term procurement deals with private local firms, the Federation of Greek Industrialists (SEV) said in a statement.

European Community directive 93/38 exempts the sectors of energy, transportation, water and telecommunications from international procurement tenders, it said.

The Public Power Corporation (DEH) is the only state utility that has signed 28 long-term agreements, it said.

Some politicians and analysts have objected to long-term procurement contracts citing higher prices and inferior quality goods from private local oligopolistic companies. --Dimitris Kontogiannis, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4
