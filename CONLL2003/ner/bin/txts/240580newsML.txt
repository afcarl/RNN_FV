ATHENS BOURSE MEMBER EUROXX OUT OF TRADE FRIDAY.

ATHENS 1996-12-06

Athens stock exchange member Euroxx Securities was not allowed to trade during Friday's session after failing to meet tight clearing house deadlines on delivery of shares.

"We obtained registered shares from the clearing house on Thursday at 14:30 although they were due on Tuesday. We had to have them signed by our clients and deliver them back to the clearing house on the same day and by 14:30 and this could not be done," said Euroxx managing director Giuseppe Gianno.

Tight T+2 settlement rules have caused problems for many members who have been barred from trade for a day. Brokers have asked bourse authorities for a less tight settlement period to avoid problems with foreign investors' custodians as well. --George Georgiopoulos, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4
