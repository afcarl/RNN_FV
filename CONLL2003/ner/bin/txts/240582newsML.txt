London gold gyrates on payroll data, Dow.

Gold's early price surge on Friday was reversed by inflation-friendly U.S. payroll date but then steadied when Wall Street opened sharply down, dealers said.

The gold price surged early in the European trading day as speculators anticipated a possible influx of "hot" money if comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan impacted badly on Wall Street.

But the weaker-than-forecast U.S. jobs data restored some financial market confidence. And although the Dow fell sharply at the start of trading, it pared losses to stand about 80 points down at 1620 GMT.

Gold was fixed at $370.25 per ounce after $373.00 on Friday morning and $369.40 on Thursday afternoon. It touched a three-year low around $366 in late trade on Tuesday amid speculative selling and talk that a central bank was also disposing of gold.

"It's all about Wall Street now," said one gold dealer.

Gold staged a dramatic recovery from its lows after Greenspan said that the Fed must be wary of "irrational exuberance" in asset markets.

"A fall in the Dow could be quiet bullish for gold as everybody has been short (of gold) and there is not much liquidity on the upside," one bullion dealer said.

Bullion market analysts had mixed views on the likely impact of Greenspan's comments on the gold price.

"Anything that upsets calm in the financial markets is good for gold but gold was going up anyway before Greenspan spoke," said bullion market analyst Andy Smith at Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS).

But analyst Tony Warwick-Ching at research group CRU International said: "I'm surprised that the reaction has been quite so strong. All Greenspan was doing was repeating what people have been saying for weeks about the sheer height of the stock markets."

Gold prices have been under pressure for several weeks from rumours of central banks selling and a daily dribble of metal on to the market by producers trying to protect themselves against falling prices.

Demand has also been weak at a time when it traditionally strengthens.

India, the biggest importer, usually buys most of its gold ahead of religious festivals and the wedding season that follows the monsoon and the harvest. But Indian importers have been shy of the world market this year in anticipation that prices have further to fall. Chinese demand has also eased, by an estimated six percent in the third 1996 quarter, according to the World Gold Council. UBS's Smith predicted a volatile gold market. "Gold shares have been bubbling and currencies are so volatile that one day producers are buying and the next selling. On top of that we have had short covering in an oversold market," he said.

The other precious metals followed gold down. Silver was a couple of cents lower at $4.81 but platinum slumped to a fresh three-year low fixing at $370.25.

"It is a bit puzzling. There has been a big seller in the market (Thursday and Friday) which has put pressure on the platinum-gold spread," one dealer said.

Palladium was $0.25 lower at $116.00.
