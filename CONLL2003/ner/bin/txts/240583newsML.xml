<p>European bourses clawed back some of their heavy losses on Friday as weak Amercan jobless figures helped counter jitters set off by the U.S. central bank chief's warning about &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infecting markets.</p>
<p>Stocks in London and Paris cut their losses within minutes of the release of data on higher U.S. unemployment rates, which suggested subdued inflationary pressures, but still remained well in the minus column.</p>
<p>Frankfurt floor trading, which closed before the U.S. figures appeared, ended with a loss of 4.05 percent but deals on in after-hours computerised transactions perked up.</p>
<p>The dollar and bonds also looked stronger after their tumbles in morning trade after Federal Reseve Chairman Alan Greenspan pulled the rug from under markets by suggesting that their current levels might be overdone.</p>
<p>The big gainer from the remarks of the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman was gold which rallied sharply as investors rushed to get out of equities into the safe haven of gold, analysts said.</p>
<p>Greenspan stopped short of commenting on the recent bull run in U.S. and European stocks but made clear that he needed to factor the activities of bears and bulls on Wall Street into deliberations on interest rates.</p>
<p>New York stocks have soared 25 percent this year and major European bourses have hit peaks in the last few weeks, leading some analysts to worry that market may be heading for a crash.</p>
<p>Fears of a possible Wall Street dive later on Friday provoked a rush of selling, sending indices into a tailspin and badly hitting the dollar, which initially showed losses against the mark and yen. It recovered after the U.S. figures.</p>
<p>European trading screens lit up to show a big selloff in the by mid-morning, with London plunging 4.16 percent, Frankfurt down 4.38 percent and Paris falling 4.51 percent.</p>
<p>Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading share prices later recovered to show a loss of 2.46 percent and Paris strengthened to a loss of only 2.79 percent.</p>
<p>German shares plummetted to close at four percent down only a day after closing at a record of 2,909.91 on the DAX index.</p>
<p>&quot;We had risen too fast and overheated, and some profit-taking and consolidation can only be healthy for the market,&quot; said Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan sent a clear message to the markets -- 'Gentlemen, you are overdoing it, restrain yourselves.' He is puncturing the speculative bubble that fuelled New York and other markets,&quot; a dealer in Paris said.</p>
<p>European debt markets also peeled themselves off the floor on the weaker jobless data but bonds remained weak and analysts said it would be hard to get back on the track of the recent rally.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets are really spooked,&quot; said Bill Westgate, vice-president at HSBC Securities in London. &quot;It will be hard to regain the confidence of a few days ago.&quot;</p>
<p>German March Bund futures on LIFFE were down 61 basis points at 100.09 in early afternoon, up from 99.84 before the data.</p>
<p>On currency markets, the dollar strengthened against the mark and yen after plummetting on Greenspan's remarks. It stood at 1.5395 marks up two pfennigs on levels in earlier trade.</p>
<p>On bullion markets, however, gold weakened after its early rally. It stood at $371.05 in afternoon trading after a mosning fix of $373 an ounce, well up on Thursday's London close of $370.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1420 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 112.52 yen and 1.5395 marks against 112.31 yen and 1.5490 marks in late Europe on Thursday.</p>
