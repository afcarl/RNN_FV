British manufacturing recovery picks up pace.

LONDON

British manufacturing output shifted up a gear in October, official figures showed Friday, keeping up pressure on the government to raise interest rates again before the general election.

But economists said the troubled sector was not out of the woods yet and the recent rise in the pound sterling may jeopardise the fragile recovery.

The Office for National Statistics said output rose 0.5 percent in October after a 0.3 percent rise in September. The wider measure of industrial production, which includes utilities' and manufacturers' output, was unchanged in October.

But economists said the strength of the pound could prove a severe setback for the sector, which relies heavily on export markets.

Firms only recently have seen tentative signs of recovery and the sector lags the lively activity seen in other areas of the economy.

"If the surveys are to be believed, manufacturing output should stage a further recovery in the coming months," said HSBC economist Jonathan Loynes.

"But the pick-up is still only fragile and a further rise in interest rates, renewing the pound's appreciation, could threaten to tip manufacuturing back towards recession."

The pound rose by around 12 percent on a trade weighted basis between August and the end of November, threatening to choke off demand for British exports by making them more expensive.

It sharply declined this week but is still 9.4 percent higher than in the summer.
