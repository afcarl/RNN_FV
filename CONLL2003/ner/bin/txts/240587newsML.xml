<p>Anglo-Australian diversified manufacturer BTR Plc impressed an otherwise despondent London share market on Friday with a reassuring trading statement that promised solid progress with its revival plan.</p>
<p>BTR, which brought in a new chief executive this year to review and revitalise its mixed bag of low and high-tech businesses around the world, said it expected its second half trading performance to show an improvement over the first half.</p>
<p>The diagnosis so cheered investors, who had been steeled for more bad news after the problems revealed in BTR's last earnings report, that they traded the stock up, despite the slump in the overall market.</p>
<p>For much of the day BTR's shares stood out as the only stock among the FTSE 100 to have risen in price, and by 1337 GMT the shares were up 5-1/2 pence at 236 pence, more than 13 pence above the day's low.</p>
<p>Turnover was heavy, all the more so considering the wider market fall, at almost 20 million shares.</p>
<p>BTR said that it was optimistic for the second half even after taking into account some pressure from a strong pound.</p>
<p>In a detailed trading update, the company said that it had disposed of businesses representing 1.6 billion pounds ($2.60 billion) of turnover, against a target of 2.3 billion pounds of sales it aims to have achieved by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>The company's new strategy, launched by chief executive Ian Strachan in September this year, seeks to generate profitable growth by concentrating on its top industrial manufacturing and engineering businesses.</p>
<p>At that time, BTR reported a sharp drop in its interim pretax profits and decided to slash its dividend payout by 28 percent to create some leeway for a radical cleanout of underperforming and non-core activities.</p>
<p>&quot;Current exchange rates will have some adverse translation impact on the second half of 1996. However, in overall terms performance of the continuing businesses is expected to show some improvement in the second half of 1996 over the first half,&quot; BTR said.</p>
<p>&quot;The recent strengthening of sterling is expected to result in the value of (the currency) benefit for the whole of the year being somewhat less that that recorded in the first half.&quot;</p>
<p>The company now expects to use about 100 million pounds of a restructuring provision announced in September in 1996. Actions already taken include reorganising several German industrial units and glass packaging operations in Australia.</p>
<p>The company expects to announce its preliminary 1996 results next March. Given the progress in disposals, it plans to compare 1996 performance with pro-rata 1995 sales of 7.7 billion pounds and operating profits of 1.4 billion pounds. ($1=.6161 Pound)</p>
