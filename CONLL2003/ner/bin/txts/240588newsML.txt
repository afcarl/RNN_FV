World markets battered by Greenspan warning.

LONDON

World stock markets took a battering Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned of "irrational exuberance" infecting assets markets.

Stocks in London, Paris, Frankfurt and Tokyo, among others, tumbled from recent record levels after Greenspan pulled the rug from under markets by suggesting that their current levels might be overdone.

The downturn was expected to spill over into U.S. markets when they opened later in the day.

Bonds were also badly hit and the dollar weakened

The big gainer from the remarks of the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman was gold, which rallied sharply as investors rushed to get out of equities into the safe haven of gold, analysts said.

Greenspan stopped short of commenting on the recent bull run in U.S. and European stocks but made clear that he needed to factor the activities of bears and bulls on Wall Street into central bank deliberations on interest rates.

U.S. stocks have soared 25 percent this year and major European bourses have hit peaks in the last few weeks, leading some analysts to worry that market may be heading for a crash.

Alarm bells rang quickly around the world, beginning in Tokyo, where stocks plunged nearly 700 points, over three percent, their biggest fall in a year and a half.

Fears of a possible Wall Street dive later provoked panic sales in Asia, sending indices into a tailspin and badly hitting the dollar, which showed losses against the mark and yen in early European trade.

European trading screens lit up to show a big selloff in the by mid-morning, with London plunging 4.16 percent, Frankfurt down 4.38 percent and Paris falling 4.51 percent.

The London Stock Exchange's FTSE 100 index of leading share prices skidded more than 167 points to 3884, chalking up its steepest one-day decline since October 1992.

"Greenspan set a trap for the market. Now people are left wondering how much of a correction will satisify his concerns," said Andy Hartwill, equity strategist with SocGen. "Now anything that looks like bad news is going to be seized upon."
