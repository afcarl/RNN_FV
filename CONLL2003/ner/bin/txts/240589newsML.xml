<p>Prime Minister John Major faced turmoil in his ruling party on Friday, with Conservative members of parliament furious at his handling of European policy and calling for the sacking of finance minister Kenneth Clarke.</p>
<p>&quot;Meltdown&quot;, &quot;civil war&quot; and &quot;chaos&quot; were some of the front page headlines describing Major's woes. An opinion poll showed the Conservatives were a staggering 37 points behind Labour with an election due within the next five months.</p>
<p>Major fought to play down the row, sparked by reports  that Chancellor of the Exchequer Clarke had faced down the prime minister by threatening to quit if there was any hardening of government policy against a European single currency.</p>
<p>Aides from the prime minister's office described relations between Clarke and Major as &quot;good&quot;, adding that Major was &quot;resolute and getting on with his job&quot;.</p>
<p>Major told reporters outside a school he was visiting in his central England constituency: &quot;If the chancellor didn't enjoy my full support, he wouldn't be chancellor. Of course he does.&quot;</p>
<p>Rank and file Conservative MPs, led by those on the &quot;Eurosceptic&quot; wing of the party opposed to any moves towards European integration, are furious at Clarke's bid to hold the line on Europe and what they see as Major's failure to resist.</p>
<p>The Eurosceptics want Major to rule out British entry into a single currency during the next parliament, a move opposed by Clarke who wants Britain to retain its &quot;wait-and-see&quot; policy.</p>
<p>Labour leader Tony Blair said the government was &quot;visibly disintegrating&quot; and &quot;descending into shambles&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;If they can't be trusted to keep the Conservative party together, how on earth can they run the country?...The sooner they are put out of their misery the better,&quot; Blair said.</p>
<p>Blair's blunt remarks coincided with media speculation that the latest row over Europe could escalate, forcing Major -- who is nursing a fragile one-seat parliamentary majority -- to call a snap election well ahead of the May deadline.</p>
<p>Conservative party managers were hoping that the return of MPs to their constituencies this weekend will calm tempers.</p>
<p>But former minister Edward Leigh said Clarke was in a minority and both he and Major had to accept the will of the party, which was against a single currency. Eurosceptic Tony Marlow demanded Clarke's resignation as the anger usually expressed by Conservative MPs behind closed doors boiled over.</p>
<p>Their fury erupted at a private meeting on Thursday night, where one was reported to have asked: &quot;Who's running the government, Clarke or Major?&quot;</p>
<p>Another was reported by colleagues to have berated Major in a parliamentary canteen, snapping: &quot;Start running the country.&quot;</p>
<p>Clarke, a staunch pro-European with few allies in Major's cabinet, has denied the reports of his threatened resignation.</p>
<p>But his denial was undermined when it was revealed that the reports, first aired on the BBC, came after Clarke had lunched with two BBC journalists in a top London restaurant -- a lunch witnessed by a leading Labour politician at the next table.</p>
<p>Friday's poll showed Labour's lead had soared by 10 points since Clarke's crucial pre-election budget last month which included a one percentage point cut in income tax.</p>
<p>The Gallup poll showed Labour support had risen four points to 59, while the Conservatives fell six points to 22. Bookmakers immediately lengthened the odds of the Conservatives hanging on in power at the election from 9-4 to 5-2. ($1=.6161 Pound)</p>
