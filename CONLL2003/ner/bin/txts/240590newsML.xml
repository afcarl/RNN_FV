<headline>FOCUS-Eurobourses battered by Greenspan warning.</headline>

<p>European bourses took a battering on Friday, falling heavily after U.S. central bank chief Alan Greenspan's warning about &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infecting markets.</p>
<p>Stocks in London, Paris and Frankfurt, tumbled from recent record levels and the dollar weakened as Greenspan pulled the rug from under markets by suggesting that their current levels might be overdone. Bonds too were badly hit.</p>
<p>The big gainer from the remarks of the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman was gold which rallied sharply as investors rushed to get out of equities into the safe haven of gold, analysts said.</p>
<p>Greenspan stopped short of commenting on the recent bull run in U.S. and European stocks but made clear that he needed to factor the activities of bears and bulls on Wall Street into deliberations on interest rates.</p>
<p>New York stocks have soared 25 percent this year and major European bourses have hit peaks in the last few weeks, leading some analysts to worry that market may be heading for a crash.</p>
<p>Alarm bells rang quickly around the world, beginning in Tokyo where stocks plunged nearly 700 points, over three percent, in frantic trade on Friday, their biggest fall in a year and a half.</p>
<p>Fears of a possible Wall Street dive later on Friday provoked panic sales in Asia, sending indices into a tailspin and badly hitting the dollar, which showed losses against the mark and yen in early European trade.</p>
<p>European trading screens lit up to show a big selloff in the by mid-morning, with London plunging 4.16 percent, Frankfurt down 4.38 percent and Paris falling 4.51 percent.</p>
<p>Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading share prices skidded more than 167 points to 3884, chalking up its steepest one-day decline since October 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan set a trap for the market. Now people are left wondering how much of a correction will satisify his concerns,&quot; said Andy Hartwill, equity strategist with SocGen. &quot;Now anything that looks like bad news is going to be seized upon.&quot;</p>
<p>German shares plummetted four percent only a day after closing at a record of 2,909.91 on the DAX index.</p>
<p>The plunge reversed a record-breaking rally sparked by the dollar's recent strength, which had boosted exporting chemical and auto sectors in particular.</p>
<p>&quot;We had risen too fast and overheated, and some profit-taking and consolidation can only be healthy for the market,&quot; said Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Greenspan's anti-inflation comments were also a catalyst for huge profit-taking in Paris where the bourse fell 4.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan sent a clear message to the markets -- 'Gentlemen, you are overdoing it, restrain yourselves.' He is puncturing the speculative bubble that fuelled New York and other markets,&quot; a dealer in Paris said.</p>
<p>European bourses will be watching for data on U.S. November payrolls and unemployment due at 1330 GMT for clue on the state of the  American economy.</p>
<p>European debt markets were not spared. March German Bund futures on LIFFE were down 41 basis points at 100.29 after crumpling to a low of 99.87 at the open. March gilt futures slid 25/32 to 108-31 while March Italian bond futures dropped 93 basis points to 127.68.</p>
<p>&quot;The sell-off is all on the back of Greenspan's comments,&quot; said Jonathan York, a futures broker at Cater Allen here.</p>
<p>On  currency markets, the dollar weakened against the mark and yen as traders, spooked by Greenspan's remarks, nervously awaited New York's opening and the U.S. employment figures.</p>
<p>The dollar clawed back some losses after the  comments pulled the dollar down two pfennigs in early trade. By mid-morning it was at 1.5335 marks, compared with 1.5490 at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>On bullion markets, however, gold prices rallied sharply in early European trading. The metal was fixed at $373 an ounce level, well up on Thursday's London close of $370.</p>
<p>&quot;The remarks made by Greenspan could not have come at a better time for gold which was reeling under downside pressure,&quot; one trader commented.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1200 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 112.10 yen and 1.5335 marks against 112.31 yen and 1.5490 marks in late Europe on Thursday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1200 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was down 162.3 points at 3,887.9.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 share index was down 101.96 points at 2,191.31.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index down 133.48 points at 2,776.43.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $373 an ounce, compared with $370.00 at Thursday's close. Silver was at $4.88, up five cents.</p>
