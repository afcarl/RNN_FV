IPE oil futures drop as some Elf workers end strik.

LONDON 1996-12-06

IPE oil futures fell sharply after workers at one Elf refinery voted to end their nine-day-old strike and traders guessed that workers at the other two Elf refineries may follow suit.

"It took about $1.50 off of gas oil," said one energy analyst. "The roller coaster continues and this time we're on a dip down."

Profit-taking after a week of hefty gains and earlier news that Iraq expected to sell oil from Tuesday also pressured Brent and gas oil prices, traders said.  

But oil futures showed resilience on views the Iraqi oil could be well absorbed as the market heads deep into winter and this week's gains were on solid footing.

At 1537 GMT, Jan Brent was off 46 cents at $24.17 a barrel after breaking $24 to hit a new session low of $23.98.

Dec gas oil traded $3.25 lower at $226.25 a tonne after dropping to $224.75.

"We have seen the Iraqi stories through the week and the market continued to move higher and higher," said one broker. "I would put the weakness down to end of the week profit-taking."
