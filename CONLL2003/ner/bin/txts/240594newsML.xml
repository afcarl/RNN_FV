<title>UK: IPE oil futures drop as some Elf workers end strik.</title>
<headline>IPE oil futures drop as some Elf workers end strik.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE oil futures fell sharply after workers at one Elf refinery voted to end their nine-day-old strike and traders guessed that workers at the other two Elf refineries may follow suit.</p>
<p>&quot;It took about $1.50 off of gas oil,&quot; said one energy analyst. &quot;The roller coaster continues and this time we're on a dip down.&quot;</p>
<p>Profit-taking after a week of hefty gains and earlier news that Iraq expected to sell oil from Tuesday also pressured Brent and gas oil prices, traders said.  </p>
<p>But oil futures showed resilience on views the Iraqi oil could be well absorbed as the market heads deep into winter and this week's gains were on solid footing.</p>
<p>At 1537 GMT, Jan Brent was off 46 cents at $24.17 a barrel after breaking $24 to hit a new session low of $23.98.</p>
<p>Dec gas oil traded $3.25 lower at $226.25 a tonne after dropping to $224.75.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen the Iraqi stories through the week and the market continued to move higher and higher,&quot; said one broker. &quot;I would put the weakness down to end of the week profit-taking.&quot;</p>
