UK's OFT invites comment on Stakis hotel buy.

LONDON 1996-12-06

The UK's director General of Fair Trading on Friday invited comment on the acquisition of Metropole Hotels by Stakis Plc.

"The director general of fair trading is considering whether the acquisition by Stakis Plc of Metropole Hotels qualifies for investigation," the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said in a statement.

Comments on the "implications for competition and other aspects of the public interest" should be made to the OFT by December 20, it added.

Lonrho announced the 327 million stg sale of its five Metropole Hotels to the Scottish-based group Stakis in October.

The sale was part of Lonrho's strategy to focus on its core mining interests by demerging its hotel operations and its African trading business.
