Shuttle tankers to grab record UK oil share-Wood Mackenzie.

LONDON 1996-12-06

The development of several new North Sea fields via floating production systems should see a record 23 percent of British oil production exported via shuttle tankers in 1997, industry consultants Wood Mackenzie said.

About 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) could be exported by shuttle tankers as 11 new fields come on stream next year, six of them using offshore tanker loading as their preferred export route, the Edinburgh-based consultants said in their December report.

"This increase is despite the loss of around 125,000 bpd of Fulmar Area production which will be exported through the Norpipe system from early 1997," Wood Mackenzie said.

Crude production in the British sector of the North Sea is expected to rise by around five percent, or some 210,000 bpd, to a record 2.78 million bpd in 1997 as the 11 new fields are brought onstream and volumes increase from fields commissioned this year.

The BP-operated Forties pipeline system will continue to export about one third of British production next year, or about 920,000 bpd, as two new fields are tied-in, Wood Mackenzie said.
