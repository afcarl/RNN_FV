<p>NATO is considering whether to offer Russia a unique, three-tier security deal that could give Moscow a say in the running of the western alliance, British officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said the proposed deal could help quell Russia's fears over planned NATO expansion by demonstrating that the alliance wanted cooperation rather than confrontation with Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;It is correct that there is an idea of an agreement...but there is a lot which has not yet been agreed,&quot; a British official told reporters.</p>
<p>Moscow has denounced NATO's plan to enlarge to take in some of the former Soviet satellites in Central and Eastern Europe, on the grounds it could threaten Russian national security.</p>
<p>But Russia still wants a deal to guarantee its interests in the post-expansion period and NATO wants to formalise the relationship.</p>
<p>NATO ministers will discuss aspects of the new proposal in Brussels next week before meeting Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Wednesday to see whether he favours their vision of how future ties could be mapped out.</p>
<p>&quot;NATO will say what it wants to achieve and we hope Primakov will say: &quot;Fine, let's negotiate',&quot; the official said, adding there was no chance of Russia being able to stop the enlargement process.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than protesting, they're better advised to take the policy being offered to them and see what they can do with it.&quot;</p>
<p>NATO wants to conclude a charter governing future relations with Russia before an alliance summit next year formally invites a handful of European countries to start negotiating membership.</p>
<p>Under the proposed plan, which defence sources said was being heavily promoted by Germany, bilateral relations would be divided into three tiers:</p>
<p>*one where NATO took decisions and told Moscow before they were implemented</p>
<p>*one where NATO and Moscow held consultations on matters of joint interest</p>
<p>*one where NATO and Russia took joint decisions, which could effectively give Moscow the right of veto</p>
<p>Defence sources said the crucial matter still to be decided was what matters the third tier would deal with, since Russia could be offended if it felt it was only being given the right to decide minor questions.</p>
<p>But British officials made clear Moscow would not be allowed to interfere with the alliance's own decision-making process.</p>
<p>&quot;NATO decides what NATO will do,&quot; one official said, adding that the alliance and Russia should not ride roughshod over the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want any idea of NATO and Russia deciding security issues for other countries, above the heads of those countries. There will not be a NATO-Russia directorate for European security,&quot; the official added.</p>
<p>In another bid to quell Moscow's fears over expansion, next week's NATO meeting is likely to declare that the alliance could foresee no circumstances under which nuclear weapons could be stationed on the territory of new member states.</p>
<p>The British officials insisted that the charter should be kept separate from the enlargement, but conceded that the signing of any agreement with Russia would be sensitive.</p>
<p>&quot;If Russia were there signing a charter as NATO announced it was enlarging, it would look like Russia was blessing the enlargement. Moscow might want to play it a little differently from that,&quot; one official said.</p>
