<headline>UK to refer BA/AA alliance unless conditions met.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The British Government said on Friday it would refer the proposed transatlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers accepted a number of undertakings.</p>
<p>Ian Lang, President of the Board of Trade, said he agreed with the Office of Fair Trading that certain conditions must be met by the airlines. These include BA/AA dropping 168 slots at London Heathrow airport, the busiest in Europe, and BA dropping a clause in its agreement with USAir to bar USAir from competing on transatlantic routes.  </p>
<p>Even if these plus other conditions are accepted, it will be conditional on a U.S./UK open skies deal.</p>
<p>Another condition for the alliance being cleared is that the parties should be prepared to reduce services on the London to Dallas Ft Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter the market, because it was felt by the OFT that competition on this route would be hampered.</p>
<p>The OFT has also called for BA/AA to allow third party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent scheme. The government said responses should be made to the OFT by 1700 GMT on January 10, 1997.</p>
<p>The move came just as the latest round of British-U.S. open skies talks were ending in London. Sources close to those talks had told Reuters that agreement on a full blown pact had not been possible because of the uncertainty about the OFT response to the BA/AA alliance.</p>
<p>The government asked the OFT to re-examine the proposed alliance last month. It is believed it called on the OFT to try and secure some conditions from the airlines for clearance of the deal. BA is known to oppose the idea of relinquishing its Heathrow slots, of which it has 38 percent.</p>
