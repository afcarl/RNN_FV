UK Conservative MP leaves party, ends majority.

LONDON 1996-12-06

A lawmaker from Britain's ruling Conservatives on Friday said he was leaving the parliamentary party, a move which wiped out the goverment's majority of one, over a row involving a hospital in his constituency.

"I am today withdrawing my cooperation from the government," Sir John Gorst said in a statement.  

In parliamentary terminology, Gorst has resigned the whip. This means that he is assumed to oppose the government, although in practice he will decide his position on individual issues.

Before Gorst's statement, Prime Minister John Major had a one-seat majority in the 651-seat House of Commons lower house of parliament.

After the annoucement, Major is considered to be in a minority of one and dependent on the support of minority parties, such as the Ulster Unionists, to pass legislation.

Gorst, member of parliament for London's Hendon North area, earlier told deputies that Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell had broken a June promise to keep open Edgeware hospital's casualty unit.
