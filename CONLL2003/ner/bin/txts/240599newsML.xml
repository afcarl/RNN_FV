<headline>UK Conservative MP leaves party, ends majority.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>A lawmaker from Britain's ruling Conservatives on Friday said he was leaving the parliamentary party, a move which wiped out the goverment's majority of one, over a row involving a hospital in his constituency.</p>
<p>&quot;I am today withdrawing my cooperation from the government,&quot; Sir John Gorst said in a statement.  </p>
<p>In parliamentary terminology, Gorst has resigned the whip. This means that he is assumed to oppose the government, although in practice he will decide his position on individual issues.</p>
<p>Before Gorst's statement, Prime Minister John Major had a one-seat majority in the 651-seat House of Commons lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>After the annoucement, Major is considered to be in a minority of one and dependent on the support of minority parties, such as the Ulster Unionists, to pass legislation.</p>
<p>Gorst, member of parliament for London's Hendon North area, earlier told deputies that Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell had broken a June promise to keep open Edgeware hospital's casualty unit.</p>
