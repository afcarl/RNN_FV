Ladbroke shares active on lottery report.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Shares in Ladbroke Group Plc were actively traded on Friday after a report that leading gaming companies planned to launch a rival to the UK's National Lottery.

The stock was down 5-1/2p at 208-1/2p by 1441 GMT, dragged lower by sharp losses in the UK market overall, in volume of 14.1 million -- making it the third most active stock in the UK equity market.

A report in the Financial Times said Ladbroke and other gaming companies would on December 16 launch a rival to the National Lottery, which has been blamed for a decline in takings at some betting shops and bingo halls.

No-one at Ladbroke was initially available for comment.
