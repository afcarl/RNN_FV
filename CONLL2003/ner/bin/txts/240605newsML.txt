WORLD BONDS - T-bonds set to continue upward path.

U.S. Treasuries, once they have recovered from the shock of the sharp spike lower, are set to outperform German Bunds, analysts said on Friday.

T-bonds sparked a global bond sell-off after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned of "irrational exuberance." However, a lower-than-expected payrolls figure soothed those concerns and raised hopes the recent rally could continue.

"It may take a little while for the market to recover its nerves but these employment figures do continue with the soft landing picture," said George Magnus, chief international economist at UBS in London. "The economic data will tend to support a perhaps erratic but rising trend in Treasury bonds."

The U.S. Labour Department said the number of people joining the payroll in November rose by 118,000, below market forecasts of 179,000. The unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent in October.

Analysts said there were few signs of overheating in the U.S. economy, according to these figures, and investors could be wooed back into the Treasury market.

"The fact that this report was weaker than expected means investors will be encouraged to buy again," said Michael O'Hanlon, chief international economist at Paine Webber in London. "It will add to stability at the lower levels, and allow the rally to continue."

He said he expected U.S. Treasuries to outperform core European markets, with the yield spread of 10-year T-notes versus German Bunds to narrow to 35/40 basis points by the year end from a current level of more than 50 basis points.

"More and more people are looking for bond value - and with yields so low they need to buy higher yielding assets to provide sufficient returns," said O'Hanlon.

Magnus also expected the spread to aim for 38 basis points.  

The 30-year long bond was trading at 99-20 by 1510 GMT, yielding 6.53 percent.

Adam Chester, international bond strategist at Yamaichi International in London said the long bond yield was targeting 6.25 percent on a three-month timescale, although he said dealers may be unwilling to push the market much further this year.

Magnus cited a 6.0 percent target for the yield.

Analysts said further gains for Treasuries would also be dependent on the strength of data scheduled for release next week. November producer prices were due on Wednesday and consumer prices on Thursday.

Chester noted that there was still a shadow cast over the equities market, which could lead to further movement into bonds.

U.S. blue chip share prices have soared 25 percent this year, leading some analysts to worry that the market may be setting itself up for a crash that could cripple the economy.

"Bonds are generally good value on a safe haven view," said Chester. "Greenspan has marked the equity market's cards, and there may well be reallocation of assets."

Magnus said the main message from Greenspan was much more negative for the stock market than for bond markets. However, he added that markets were concerned that Greenspan was flagging a more cautious Fed policy --including the possibility of a rise in U.S. interest rates to calm down speculative fever in the equity market.

"We should understand that is how people are reacting in a knee-jerk way, but at the end of the day the Fed will only raise interest rates if there does seem to be a rising tide of economic growth which carries with it the risk of inflation," said Magnus.
