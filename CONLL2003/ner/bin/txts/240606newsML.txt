U.S. allies applaud Albright nomination. [CORRECTED 16:40 GMT]

LONDON 1996-12-06

U.S. allies in Europe and the Middle East on Friday welcomed Madeleine Albright's nomination as Secretary of State.

(Corrects, deleting reference to France in first paragraph.)

Israel reacted with fulsome praise to the appointment of Albright, currently U.S. ambassador at the United Nations who is widely seen as pro-Israeli.

First reaction from Iraq, where Albright was once branded a witch, was muted with the Iraqi ambassador to the U.N. saying he was hopeful of seeing some improvement to relations.

There was no immediate reaction from Russia.

China, congratulating Albright, said it hoped she would help improve Sino-American ties which have been badly strained by a host of issues from Taiwan to arms proliferation and trade.

Czech-born Albright was appointed on Thursday to succeed Warren Christopher in a sweeping shake-up by U.S. President Bill Clinton of his national security brain-trust.

Senator William Cohen was nominated to take over as defence secretary from William Perry.

German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, drawing attention to Albright's Czech past, expressed "great pleasure and satisfaction" at her appointment.

"Your personal and professional connection with Europe and your deep knowledge of European concerns, in particular the former Soviet Union and central and eastern Europe, are an excellent basis for bilateral and transatlantic relations in the next few years," he said.

In London, British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said he looked forward to working closely with her.

French officials welcomed the appointment and brushed off reports that ties were frayed between Paris and Washington.

"(Foreign Minister Herve de Charette) knows Mrs Albright well (and) appreciates her great qualities," ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt told reporters.

A senior French official, speaking on condition of anonymity, dismissed the notion Paris might be bitter toward Albright because of her opposition to any reappointment of Boutros Boutros-Ghali as U.N. secretary general.

Predictably, the warmest words came from Prague, her native city, where Czech President Vaclav Havel described her as a distinguished friend whose appointment carried global significance.

Albright, born Marie Korbelova the daughter of a Czechoslovak diplomat in 1937, fled with her family to the United States after a Communist coup in 1948.

"I look forward to continuing our good relations from Central Europe with the United States and with the first woman ever to hold the position of Secretary of State. I wish her well," Havel said in a statement to Reuters.

France, at odds with Washington on issues ranging from U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's reappointment to Zaire, seemed certain to be a lone, discordant voice in West European reaction.

There was no immediate official reaction, but sources at President Jacques Chirac's Elysee Palace and at foreign ministry said her nomination would dismay France.

The Conservative daily Le Figaro said her appointment and Cohen's as secretary of Defence, "could lead to a tougher U.S. foreign policy".

In the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warmly welcomed her appointment and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy in a fulsome letter to Albright said he had been "charmed by your personality, intelligence, the friendship you showed us and your nobility."

In self-ruled Gaza, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat was more muted telling reporters he had "no objections" to Albright's nomination.

"This is the choice of President Clinton and there is no objection to who President Clinton chooses," Arafat said.

The Palestinian Authority is in charge of self-rule areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip under peace deals signed with the Jewish state.

Iraqi U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon, whose country has been a constant target of Albright's since the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait by President Saddam Hussein's troops, expressed the hope of a change for the better in bilateral relations.

"I'm full of hope right now that we see a change in American policy, which is obviously determined at the top administration levels," Hamdoon said in a telephone interview.

His country is wanting to secure a lifting of U.N. economic sanctions in force since the invasion -- a move to which the United States is a key.

Albright has engaged in fierce verbal duelling with Baghdad in her current job. She has repeatedly accused Saddam of being the Iraqi people's worst enemy and in turn has been denounced by Iraqis as a witch and serpent.

Japan, a staunch U.S. ally in Asia, said it did not expect any swerves in U.S.-Japan policy, though some government sources in Tokyo drew attention to Albright and Cohen's unfamiliarity with Japanese affairs.

"I think we have a basic situation where we can maintain stable ties with the United States," Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told reporters. "I do not expect any changes in U.S.-Japan ties and I hope we can work together to deepen our relations."

Earlier this week, the United States and Japan resolved their biggest political issue over plans to streamline U.S. military bases on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa.

South Korea, another key U.S. ally in the region, also welcomed Albright's appointment, saying Clinton's new foreign policy team would keep up pressure on Communist North Korea.

North and South Korea remain technically at war after a conflict, in which a U.S.-led United Nations force helped the South, ended in 1953 with an armistice but no peace treaty.
