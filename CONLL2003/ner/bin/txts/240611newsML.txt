Albright's ascendancy shows women on rise.

From Pakistan to Britain, Norway to India, women have won the top job in politics, but it needed the United States to pick its first female secretary of state for pundits to conclude things really were changing.

"This is a major step forward for women," said a senior U.S. diplomat on condition of anonymity. "Being secretary of state in the United States is significantly more important than being prime minister of Britain or Pakistan."

That diplomat -- male, like most diplomats -- will now report to a woman after President Bill Clinton announced on Thursday that his United Nations ambassador, Madeleine Albright, would take over at the top of the State Department.

"In many ways Albright is the first woman to get to such a senior position not because she's a woman, or someone's daughter or someone's widow or sheer fluke," the diplomat said. "She's not a token and she's not a goddess: she's very, very tough."

Yet women have risen to higher office elsewhere, be it Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan, Britain's Margaret Thatcher, Norway's Gro Harlem Brundtland, Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh, Chandrika Kumaratunga and Sirima Bandaranaike in Sri Lanka, India's Indira Gandhi, Iceland's Vigdis Finnbogadottir...

The list goes on and on.

"Yes, but in the case of Britain, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, you essentially had a single woman surrounded by men, not a general lifting up of women in government. Albright is a product of the large spread of women to serious positions in the U.S. government," said the diplomat.

"The president of Iceland may have the most absolute power to declare war, but without an army it doesn't matter," he said. "Norway has plenty of women in office and is a lovely little country -- but it is little. You simply can't compare the United States to all these other countries."

Clinton, too, said he was proud to make history but made clear Albright had won the post through talent, not tokenism.

"She got the job because, I believe, amid a list of truly outstanding people, she had the best combination of qualities to succeed and to serve our country at this moment in history," Clinton said. "And I hope that she will be an inspiration to young women all across our country, all across our world."

Women's groups in the United States were thrilled.

"It's historic and it sends an international signal," said Rosemary Dempsey of the National Organisation of Women.

"I'm grinning like the Cheshire Cat," said Ellen Malcolm of Emily's List, which raises funds to help women win office.

"This is huge for women all over the world," said Democratic political consultant Jennifer Laszlo.

London, however, need not look to Washington for feminist inspiration, said an aide to former prime minister Thatcher.

"Different stages for different countries. People are always excited about something new but these things come gradually. Lady T was the right person in the right place at the right time," said Mark Worthington.

"She had an agenda but it wasn't a female agenda."

Yet "Iron Lady" Thatcher, perhaps more than any other politician, epitomises the rise of women in public life, with her grasp of detail, fierce ideology and ability to charm and terrorise in equal measure.

"The Nordic countries are leading the way when it comes to numbers of women but Thatcher was something of a trail-blazer because she was so high profile. Nor can I think of any other woman in the modern age who took a western country into war," said Joanna Spear of London's King's College.

Like many top men, she never doubted herself in office and her utterances in retirement can still make grown men squirm.

"And what's true of Thatcher is true of Albright," said one long-time associate of the rising U.S. star. "They have both demonstrated that they are a lot tougher, a lot stronger and have far more balls than the boys."
