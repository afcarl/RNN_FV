<headline>OPTIONS-Index volatility spikes as FTSE plummets.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Implied volatility levels rose sharply in the UK's index options market against a background of plunging world financial markets, dealers said.</p>
<p>Volatility spiked up by more than one percent in some strikes, with the biggest jump in out-of-the-money puts, as the FTSE 100 index at one point posted its steepest one-day drop since the 1987 stock market crash.</p>
<p>World stock and bond markets plummeted after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infecting markets.  </p>
<p>By 1437 GMT, the leading blue chip index was down 111.5 points, or 2.75 percent, to 3,939.7, after having plunged to a three-month low of 3,882.7 earlier.</p>
<p>Dealers noted a marked increase in call buying after the FTSE 100 crashed through chart support at 3,900.</p>
<p>The futures market was behind much of the downward force in the cash market, dealers said, because options traders who previously were short gamma had to sell futures as the underlying market skidded just to keep options positions neutral.</p>
