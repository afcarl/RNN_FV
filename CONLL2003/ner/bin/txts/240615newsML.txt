Czech, Hungarian banks ahead in eastern Europe-EIB.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Banks in the Czech Republic and Hungary have progressed much faster than their counterparts in other parts of Eastern Europe, Brian Unwin, the European Investment Bank's president, told Reuters.

"We are beginning to see, in the Czech Republic and in Hungary, banks which can become responsible partners in lending," he said.

"(Those are not) banks that do not have a high investment (credit) rating yet but they are beginning to form a credible banking system."

Unwin said a key issue in eastern Europe was getting the institutional structure right and developing local banking systems.

"One of the things we like to do and aim to do is to work through and with local banking systems.

"In some eastern European countries that is extremely difficult. Bulgaria is perhaps the extreme example where its banking system is in a crisis state."

Unwin said everybody was conscious of the problems to be faced in developing eastern Europe. "Banks generally are being extremely cautious."

"We (EIB) follow a very simple principle. We only lend for a project if that project has an economic rate of return and contributes to the economy of the country and enables the borrower to repay our loan."
