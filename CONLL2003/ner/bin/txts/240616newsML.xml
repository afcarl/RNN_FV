<p>A snapshot of the schizophrenia over Europe splitting Britain's Conservative party was on show to anyone watching television on Thursday night.</p>
<p>On one side of the screen was Tony Marlow, a leading &quot;Eurosceptic&quot; calling for the resignation of finance minister Kenneth Clarke because of his support for a single currency.</p>
<p>On the other side was pro-European Edwina Currie, a former junior minister, who talked in the current affairs programme of her ruling party's &quot;lunatic fringe&quot; and Clarke's qualities.</p>
<p>For a couple of minutes they squabbled, traded veiled insults and refused to budge in their conviction that their views held the key to electoral success for the government.</p>
<p>If Prime Minister John Major was watching, it must have been a depressing end to four torrid days he had spent struggling to preserve the facade of party unity.</p>
<p>Major is the muddled man in the middle of a battle of ideas which threatens to split the ruling party from top to bottom.</p>
<p>The furore over Europe, which contributed to the ditching of Margaret Thatcher as party leader in 1990, seems unending and growing in ferocity as the Conservatives' chances of victory at the next election grow more and more distant.</p>
<p>It is four years since Major was humiliated by the pound's ejection from the European currency grid.</p>
<p>But it is still Europe -- should we stay out of further integration, or should we go ahead with the rest -- that overshadows everything, putting a textbook economic recovery in the shade and allowing Labour a seemingly clear run to power.</p>
<p>Right-wingers, and an increasing number of middle of the road Conservative MPs, want Major to rule out ditching the pound sterling in favour of the Euro once and for all.</p>
<p>They believe such a switch would match the wishes of the electorate and create &quot;clear blue water&quot; between the ruling party and Labour which has pledged only to join a single currency if it was in the best interests of Britain.</p>
<p>People like Marlow believe only one person stands in their way -- Clarke, neighbour of Major at No. 11 Downing Street, probably the best parliamentary operator in the cabinet and a man who takes no prisoners over a matter of principle.</p>
<p>Clarke denied on Thursday he had threatened to resign when it was reported Major was thinking of ruling out joining the single currency in the first wave in 1999.</p>
<p>He believes Major's statement on Tuesday that the wait-and-see stance remained &quot;uneqivocally the position of the government&quot; is his guarantee. But any dilution of this position would almost certainly lead to Clarke's resignation and Conservative MPs say other ministers would join him.</p>
<p>Next week promises to be just as problematic for Major, condemned as weak and vacillating by many but someone who has performed near-miracles in keeping the party together.</p>
<p>A two-day parliamentary debate on Europe will give the Eurosceptics ample chance to air their grievances. This is followed by a two-day EU summit in Dublin where a draft treaty containing policies abhorrent to Britain will be discussed.</p>
<p>Add to this a by-election in northern England, which the Conservatives are likely to lose and therefore lose their one-seat majority in parliament, and Major's fixed smile is likely to be looking a little weak by this time next week.</p>
<p>An opinion poll on Friday showed Labour led the Conservatives by 37 points. No British party has made up such a deficit in five months and the events of this week make it extremely unlikely the Conservatives will rewrite history.</p>
<p>Labour leader Tony Blair has drummed into his party, in opposition for 17 years, that voters want conviction in politicians and divided parties lose elections.</p>
<p>He needs only to point across the floor of parliament to prove his point.</p>
