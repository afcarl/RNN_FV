Oil prices fall as Iraq gears up for crude exports.

LONDON 1996-12-06

World oil prices reversed some of the week's gains on Friday after Iraq said it would be able to start crude oil exports early next week pending a final U.N. report allowing partial oil sales.

International marker crude Brent Blend for January delivery on London's International Petroleum Exchange fell to an intra-day low of $24.04 a barrel but later recovered to trade 51 cents down at $24.12 a barrel by 1356 GMT.

"It's down because of the headline that Iraq is to resume exports on Tuesday," a futures broker said. He also mentioned weakness in the stock market and fears of a knock-on effect on commodities.

Iraqi Oil Minister General Amir Muhammad Rasheed said in an interview on Iraqi television that his country would be able to export oil early on Tuesday morning once U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali submitted his final report as scheduled.

"We expect the U.N. secretary-general to submit his final report no later than Monday (December 9)," he said in the interview, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.

"This means that, at the first minute after midnight on Monday New York time (0500 GMT), we will have the right to begin (exporting oil) if this report is submitted as planned and expected," Rasheed said.

Iraqi oil exports have been banned under a U.N. economic embargo imposed by the U.N. Security Council after Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Before Friday's fall, prices had gained $1.80 a barrel, largely as a tight supply scenario was exacerbated by French refinery strikes, cold weather and a U.S. refinery fire earlier in the week.

Oil prices have been consolidating at higher levels despite the prospect of imminent Iraqi oil sales because of strong demand in a tight winter market vulnerable to any potential supply disruption.

Iraq's absence from the world's market and the delay in implementing the oil-for-food plan in September took prices to their highest level since the Gulf crisis.

Under the U.N. plan, agreed on May 20, Iraq will be allowed to sell $2.0 billion in crude oil to buy food and medicines for six months. The deal is renewable.

Although importing humanitarian goods was not banned under the sanctions, an Iraq starved of oil revenue was unable to fund the purchases.

Iraq was the second biggest oil producer within the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) before the Gulf War. It produced just over 3.0 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and had an OPEC quota allocation of 3.14 million bpd.

OPEC last week decided to stick to its overall  production ceiling of 25.03 million bpd -- set in June to take account of an estimated 800,000 bpd of Iraqi exports -- for the first half of 1997. But recent high prices mean the volume will be slightly lower.

Rasheed said earlier this week that Iraq expected to export 650,000 bpd of crude oil through its two export terminals of Ceyhan on the Turkish Mediterranean coast and the Gulf port of Mina al-Bakr.

Analysts say the market should be able to absorb the additional Iraqi barrels during the tight winter months without much negative impact on prices, although the prospect is for weakness during the low demand second and third quarters.
