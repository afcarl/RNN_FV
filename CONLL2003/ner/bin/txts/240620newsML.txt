London platinum falls to fresh three-year low fix.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Platinum slumped to a fresh three-year low fixing on Friday afternoon at $370.25 per ounce.

It was its lowest fix since December 1, 1993. On Friday morning it recorded $372.00.  

"It is a bit puzzling. There has been a big seller in the market (Thursday and Friday) which has put pressure on the platinum-gold spread," one dealer said.

Other dealers said unwinding of a long platinum position in Tokyo overnight had started the price weakness.

Platinum briefly traded at a discount to gold on Friday morning as the yellow metal rallied in response to weaker stock and bond markets.

Imports by Japan, the leading user of platinum, have been lower this year than last, which has put the price under pressure in a well-supplied market, dealers said.
