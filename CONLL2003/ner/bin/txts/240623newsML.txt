EIB to broaden use of eastern European currencies.

LONDON 1996-12-06

The European Investment Bank (EIB) may issue debt in several eastern European currencies it has not yet tapped, its top finance officer told Reuters on Friday.

"We are looking at a few other markets in eastern Europe. One of them is the Hungarian forint," said Rene Karsenti, the EIB's director general of finance.

"We're having discussions there to set up some sort of medium-term notes programme and also to look at foreign transactions," he said. "We are also looking at the Slovak (crown) market, and we are looking at the (Polish) zloty market."

EIB president Brian Unwin said "It depends on demand for the currency. Nearly all our lending in those countries has been in marks or dollars."

Unwin said the EIB could issue a bond and swap the proceeds.

"But ideally, we would like to have demand in the local currency. In a sense, we can then act as an intermediator for picking up savings and translating those savings into long-term investment in that country."

The EIB, the world's largest borrower in international markets, launched a 1.5 billion Czech crown Eurobond in July and a 1.0 billion crown deal in September.
