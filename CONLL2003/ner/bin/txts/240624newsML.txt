NWE oil products mixed, Elf strike vote awaited.

LONDON 1996-12-06

NWE oil products were mixed with striking Elf refinery workers voting this afternoon.

Naphtha was steady after catching up to crude's late rally Thursday and then easing when crude fell on Friday.

Gasoline barges rose $2 as the market held its breath ahead of this afternoon's vote by striking Elf workers.

Gas oil fell $2.50 and barge premiums slid up to $1, at around Dec IPE -$1, with cargoes barely steady.

High sulphur was narrowly easier in line with softer crude, but low sulphur cracked was holding firm.
