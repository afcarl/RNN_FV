<headline>NWE gasoline holds breath as Elf workers set to vote.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>NWE gasoline prices were slightly higher in quiet trading on Friday as the market held its breath ahead of results from Elf refinery workers voting this afternoon on whether to end their nine-day-old strike.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course that seems to have an influence but it seems like it's coming to an end so we may get some pressure from the cargo side,&quot; said one barge trader.</p>
<p>Eurograde barges were up $2 at $227/$229 fob ARA while regular unleaded continued to narrow its deficit to premium unleaded, trading at $223 fob ARA, up $3.</p>
<p>Premium unleaded cargoes were notionally valued unchanged at $228/$230 cif.</p>
<p>Traders said gasoline may retreat if the Elf strike ends and perceptions grow that the rich refinery margins will entice refiners into boosting their gasoline yields.</p>
<p>But NWE supply was still seen rather dry, with cargoes heading to the U.S. and Elf buying up to 100,000 to 125,000 tonnes of gasoline over the last week.</p>
<p>Striking Elf Aquitaine workers were set to vote from 1300 GMT and union and management sources said the oil company will need about two days to restore output at its three refineries that pump about 100,000 barrels per day of gasoline.</p>
<p>Workers at the Donges and Grandpuits refineries allowed some oil products out of refinery storage from Thursday but unions said workers at Feyzin refused.</p>
