<p>A high-level conference on Bosnia has given the war-scarred state a push towards economic independence, but the West is insisting economic aid must be tied to compliance with the terms of peace.</p>
<p>The two-day Peace Implementation Conference, attended by more than 50 countries, ended in London on Thursday after reviewing the first year of peace in the former Yugoslav republic and setting specific goals for the second.</p>
<p>It urged Bosnia to take greater responsibility for its own economic recovery and promised to keep backing it with reconstruction aid as long as it complied with the Dayton accord that ended the 43-month war.</p>
<p>International mediator Carl Bildt told Reuters late on Thursday the West meant what it said in tying reconstruction money to fulfilment of the Dayton terms, and would target that pressure at politically sensitive cases.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to apply conditionality on new projects and ones of specific political importance,&quot; he said after Bosnia's two entities -- a Moslem-Croat federation and a Serb republic --jointly signed their first international loan at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).</p>
<p>Asked which projects would be in the firing line, he pointed in particular to money earmarked for rebuilding houses destroyed in the war.</p>
<p>&quot;On the Federation side we are directing lots of money towards house rebuilding -- we are not doing that on the Serb side because we are not happy with the level of compliance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Josue Tanaka, leader of the EBRD's country team for Bosnia, said on Friday he would not be surprised if failure to hand over war criminals or to let refugees return delayed rebuilding work.</p>
<p>&quot;Instability, the inability to get strong institutions and human rights issues could be a brake on reconstruction,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But in a sign that at least part of the West's message was getting through, the president of Bosnia's Serb entity, Biljana Plavsic, said it could expect some movement on issues that had been sticking points before.</p>
<p>&quot;In my opinion the refugee problem and the Brcko problem will be priorities,&quot; she said before leaving London, referring to thorny negotiations on the status of the strategically important northern Bosnian town.</p>
<p>But she made no mention of movement on the issue of indicted war criminals or other humanitarian concerns.</p>
<p>The Bosnian Serb republic has received just two percent of some $900 million in foreign money that has gone into rebuilding the state this year, while the lion's share has gone to the Moslem-Croat federation.</p>
<p>Bildt said he would like the Serbs' portion to increase, but declined to be drawn on what would be an appropriate level.</p>
<p>&quot;It should be distributed according to need,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In its conference conclusions the Peace Implementation Council said primary responsibility for Bosnia's economic future lay with the Bosnian authorities themselves, and stressed that it did not want to stay embroiled in the country forever.</p>
<p>It said a central bank should be fully functional as early as possible in 1997. Bosnia should establish a market-oriented economy and take steps towards privatisation, formulate fiscal and foreign trade policy, and set up a viable customs service.</p>
<p>Foreign aid, particularly for utilities, transport, telecommunications and housing, would be available during the two-year consolidation period, with a fresh pledging conference planned for February next year to raise another $1.4 billion towards the $5.1 billion needed to the end of the century.</p>
<p>The council also encouraged the Paris and London clubs to weigh substantial debt relief for post-war Bosnia.</p>
