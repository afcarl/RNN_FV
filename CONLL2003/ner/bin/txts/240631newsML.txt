UK political uncertainty could unsettle markets.

Perceptions of serious divisions inside Britain's Conservative government could unsettle London financial markets, undermining the pound, shares and government bonds, economists said on Friday.

The risk of Prime Minister John Major being forced to call a snap election, possibly several months before the final deadline of May 22, 1997, is also increasingly exercising traders' minds.

Almost every day this week, Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) Kenneth Clarke has denied both that he is at odds with Prime Minister John Major over a single European currency and that he has threatened to resign.

Major again pledged his full support for the pro-European chancellor on Friday, although such assurances are seen by some market operators as evidence of some foundation to reports of differences between them.

Share prices and government bonds crashed on Friday, largely because of a heavy sell-off in the United States and elsewhere, but economists said domestic political uncertainty was a background factor which could cause further upsets.

"If we see increasing signs of a rift within the Conservative government and particularly between the prime minister and chancellor, that is going to unnerve international investors," said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International.

Major faces a gruelling week next week.

Parliament will debate European policy, a political minefield, on Wednesday and Thursday. And the Conservatives look certain to lose their one-seat parliamentary majority in a by-election on Thursday.

On Friday and Saturday, Major and Clarke will attend a European Union summit in Dublin at which any differences between them could be exposed.

Paul Horne, chief international economist at Smith Barney Inc in Paris, said European fund managers were keeping a wary eye on the British political scene and were conscious of the government's fragility.

"Certainly any Frankfurt or Paris fund manager is aware of it, particularly since most of them are going to be fairly heavily weighted in London equities," he said.

"If it looks as if there might be an early election, I think there could well be profit-taking in the London equity portfolios held in Paris and Frankfurt."

May 1 is still seen as the most likely date for the general election if the government survives until then. Opinion polls give the Labour Party a huge lead over the Conservatives.

Horne said many Continental investors, keen to see European integration proceed and angry at Britain's prevarication, would like to see the Conservatives replaced but remain wary of Labour.

"They would like to get rid of the Tories for European reasons, but they are not overjoyed at the idea of having to see through the early days of a new Labour government when Labour's programme is so unclear," he said.

Clarke is adamant that Britain must keep its options open on whether or not to join a single European currency and is determined the government should resist pressure from "Euro-sceptic" Conservatives to rule it out now. Economists said that if Clarke were to resign, or even be sacked, this could upset markets.

"Potentially, it would be a negative," said Joanne Collins, senior economist at Nomura International Plc. "But I guess it would be a small negative against the bigger issue, which is that the government is probably going to change anyway in a matter of months."
