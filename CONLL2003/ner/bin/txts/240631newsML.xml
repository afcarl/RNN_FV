<p>Perceptions of serious divisions inside Britain's Conservative government could unsettle London financial markets, undermining the pound, shares and government bonds, economists said on Friday.</p>
<p>The risk of Prime Minister John Major being forced to call a snap election, possibly several months before the final deadline of May 22, 1997, is also increasingly exercising traders' minds.</p>
<p>Almost every day this week, Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) Kenneth Clarke has denied both that he is at odds with Prime Minister John Major over a single European currency and that he has threatened to resign.</p>
<p>Major again pledged his full support for the pro-European chancellor on Friday, although such assurances are seen by some market operators as evidence of some foundation to reports of differences between them.</p>
<p>Share prices and government bonds crashed on Friday, largely because of a heavy sell-off in the United States and elsewhere, but economists said domestic political uncertainty was a background factor which could cause further upsets.</p>
<p>&quot;If we see increasing signs of a rift within the Conservative government and particularly between the prime minister and chancellor, that is going to unnerve international investors,&quot; said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International.</p>
<p>Major faces a gruelling week next week.</p>
<p>Parliament will debate European policy, a political minefield, on Wednesday and Thursday. And the Conservatives look certain to lose their one-seat parliamentary majority in a by-election on Thursday.</p>
<p>On Friday and Saturday, Major and Clarke will attend a European Union summit in Dublin at which any differences between them could be exposed.</p>
<p>Paul Horne, chief international economist at Smith Barney Inc in Paris, said European fund managers were keeping a wary eye on the British political scene and were conscious of the government's fragility.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly any Frankfurt or Paris fund manager is aware of it, particularly since most of them are going to be fairly heavily weighted in London equities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If it looks as if there might be an early election, I think there could well be profit-taking in the London equity portfolios held in Paris and Frankfurt.&quot;</p>
<p>May 1 is still seen as the most likely date for the general election if the government survives until then. Opinion polls give the Labour Party a huge lead over the Conservatives.</p>
<p>Horne said many Continental investors, keen to see European integration proceed and angry at Britain's prevarication, would like to see the Conservatives replaced but remain wary of Labour.</p>
<p>&quot;They would like to get rid of the Tories for European reasons, but they are not overjoyed at the idea of having to see through the early days of a new Labour government when Labour's programme is so unclear,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Clarke is adamant that Britain must keep its options open on whether or not to join a single European currency and is determined the government should resist pressure from &quot;Euro-sceptic&quot; Conservatives to rule it out now. Economists said that if Clarke were to resign, or even be sacked, this could upset markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Potentially, it would be a negative,&quot; said Joanne Collins, senior economist at Nomura International Plc. &quot;But I guess it would be a small negative against the bigger issue, which is that the government is probably going to change anyway in a matter of months.&quot;</p>
