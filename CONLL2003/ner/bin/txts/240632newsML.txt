Euro veg oils almost at standstill, thinly traded.

LONDON 1996-12-06

European vegetable oils were almost at a complete standstill at midday as they searched for any scrap of news on which to base a significant move.

Hope that Ivan Wong's November Malaysian palm oil report would provide a spark to the market soon evaporated upon the report's release.

"There was nothing in Ivan Wong's report that the market hadn't already factored in...we can live with figures," one trader said.

Ivan Wong put Malaysia's output in November at 764,000 tonnes, a fall of 14 pct from October.

Countering the lower output figure were Malaysian end-November stocks estimated at 965,000 tonnes, up from 953,241 previously.

The palm oil sector in Europe at midday was mostly unchanged to $2.50 above Thursday's close. Only palm stearin deviated from the pattern to close the morning up to $2.50 lower.

RBD palm oil fetched $516/$516.50 for Dec material, while olein made $552.50 up to $555 also for Dec and $548.50 for Jan.

Soy oil held on to its opening slender gains of 0.50 to one guilder up on Thursday's finish but was now awaiting fresh direction from the Chicago soybean oil futures later.

Coconut oil was unchanged to $7.50 firmer.
