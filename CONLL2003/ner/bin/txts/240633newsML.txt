Iraq expects to be able to resume oil exports from 0500 GMT on Tuesday, Iraqi Oil Minister General Amir Muhammad Rasheed said in an interview shown on Iraqi state television on Friday.

"We expect the U.N. secretary-general to submit his final report no later than Monday (9 December)," he said in the interview monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation. "This means that, at the first minute after midnight on Monday New York time (0500 GMT Tuesday), we will have the right to begin (exporting oil) if this report is submitted as planned and expected."
