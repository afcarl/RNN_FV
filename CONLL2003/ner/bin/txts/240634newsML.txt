World's priciest cigars at auction fetch $28,570.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Just a sniff of their rich, pungent aroma can send aficianados into murmurs of delight, but when 163 of the world's oldest cigars sold for a record 17,600 pounds ($28,570) on Thursday even the experts were surprised.

"It's a very high price, but they are absolutely unique," said Paul Bowker, the head of the wine department at Christie's.

"The most remarkable thing is the condition they are in after 140 odd years." Christie's said they were the world's most expensive cigars sold at auction.

Peter de Savary of the Carnegie Club at Skibo Castle in Scotland bought the oak cabinet containing the 108 Vequeros 1858, 28 Regalia 1856, 20 Murray 1857 and seven Colerados 1858, after a fierce bidding war with Marvin Shanken, publisher of The Cigar Aficionado.

"These cigars must be among the oldest available cigars in the world today," he said.

Bowker said Christie's was 99 percent certain that the cigars, which sold for double their estimated price, were Havanas, regarded as the best cigars in the world.

The high price they fetched reflected a new interest in cigar smoking evident by the number of cigar bars and clubs in New York and London and the increasing number of women who are developing what was previously a male passion.

The Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, whose relatives purchased the cigars in the 1850s, agreed that an expert could smoke and appraise one of the Vequeros for the sale.

"Smokes perfectly, beautiful draw with a fine white ash. Rich, oily flavour, an aromatic, perfumed but full-bodied smoke," was the verdict.
