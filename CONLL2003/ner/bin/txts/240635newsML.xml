<p>An elderly man being treated in a Scottish hospital for the E coli bacteria died on Friday, taking the death toll of the food poisoning outbreak to eight.</p>
<p>&quot;This patient, who had been recovering from his E coli infection and was due to go home today, died unexpectedly during the night,&quot; a spokeswoman for the Forth Valley Health Board said.</p>
<p>She confirmed that 78 people suspected of having the disease, including 64 confirmed cases, were still being treated. Three of the patients were listed in poor condition.</p>
<p>More than 290 people have reported food poisoning symptoms in nearby Lanarkshire, the worst hit area, since the outbreak that first came to light after people ate tainted meat pies at a pensioners' lunch. The health board there said 128 cases had been confirmed.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the fatal victims of the food poisoning, which has been traced to a prize-winning Scottish butcher's shop, have been elderly.</p>
<p>E coli is a common gut bacteria that normally is harmless. But a toxic strain that lives in cattle can be passed to humans via manure or improper slaughtering.</p>
<p>Recent outbreaks of E coli poisoning have been reported in the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>More than 20 cases in Washington state, Colorado, California and Canada were linked to unpasteurised apple juice. In 1993, 500 people became ill in the Seattle area and three children died after eating undercooked hamburgers.</p>
<p>In Tokyo last July, 11 people, mainly schoolchildren, died and 9,500 became ill.</p>
<p>The British government said there had been more than 1,300 cases of E coli poisoning in Scotland since 1990.</p>
