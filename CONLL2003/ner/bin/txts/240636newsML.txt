RESEARCH ALERT - Morgan Stanley lowers Euro equities.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Morgan Stanley said it had moved to an "underweight" position on European equities for the first time since March 1995 because it expects most European markets to finish lower next year.

The brokerage said in a European strategy note it had cut equity holdings on Monday by two percent to 48 percent whilst raising cash holdings to 22 percent from 20 precent.

The shift came before European markets tumbled in response to comments on inflationary pressures made by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan.  

Morgan Stanley said the current bull market was "long in the tooth", and pointed to "many potential triggers" that could spark a reversal.

UK shares fell sharply on Friday, with the benchmark FTSE-100 index down 142.8 to 3,908.4 by 1314 GMT, wiping 25 billion stg from the value of UK stocks.

Morgan Stanley said policy-makers were running monetary conditions that could see a doubling of European inflation over the next four years or so.  

"Equities have not discounted that," strategist Richard Davidson said in the research note.

"We think there will be growth surprise on the upside in 1997, pushing up bond yields and hurting equities," he said.
