LIFFE coffee retraces further, switches active.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Robusta coffee futures dipped further in the morning trade on new fund selling with nearby switches taking the bulk of the volume, traders said.

"There's continuous fund system selling in London as well as trade selling in front of New York," said one.

Anti-inflation remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan had no immediate impact on the market, with the current flurry of fund sales showing no signs of abating.

Traders said widespread perception that the March New York contract would test 100 U.S. cents a lb now provided the selling impetus.

"A break towards 102 (cents) on March will get additional system selling, so the trade has been selling London ahead of that," the trader said. The March contract closed 0.75 cent down at 103.45 cents on Thursday.

By the midday close, January was $1 lower at $1,310 a tonne but March gave up $9 at $1,240.

Light industry price-fixing at the lows helped cushion the fall. But traders said origin sellers were still marking up their prices.

"The origins are the moment are not really at market levels but there have been some sales from Uganda at market levels," one said.

Midday volume was 3,853 lots, with March alone accounting for 2,008 lots. Traders said Jan/March switch saw deals at $70 while March/May was traded up to $35.

Traders said many players were also looking to liquidate their arbitrage positions by selling London and buying New York.

"A lot of people have been the other way round with their positions...it's been very painful over the last month or two and they are quite happy to trade their losses on them," one said.

Coffee prices have fallen sharply in recent weeks, with January futures alone losing some seven percent in a week.

The slide came as investment funds, increasingly dominant market, unloaded positions to stop further losses.

Fundamentally, robusta coffee supplies are on the upswing on seasonal factors. -- Jalil Hamid, London Newsroom +44 171 542 4985
