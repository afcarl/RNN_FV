European aluminium--Premiums higher on spot trade.

Physical aluminium premiums in Europe picked up across-the-board this week, as spot demand for duty-unpaid Western ingots lifted the market out of a recent rut, traders said.

Duty-unpaid business was reported at levels around $42 over London Metal Exchange (LME), lifting the premium to $40/45. Duty-paid Western was transacted at $120, also some $5 higher.

"They are firming up quite significantly, and some people are happy to push the spot premiums up," one said.

Generally, it is the business in duty-unpaid that is driving the market, and there has been some talk that producers have been buying metal, possibly to meet immediate requirements, some traders said.

"I'm not so sure about that, but if people have to do spot, as opposed to first quarter 1997, then they will have to pay up," another trader said.

As well as Western ingots, the premiums for Russian aluminium, both LME quality and off-grade, have also risen. Russian A6 and A5 metal is now well-established at premium levels, while the discount for A0 continues to shrink.

As well as increased demand, there are ever-present logistical reasons for premiums to harden.

There is less duty-unpaid aluminium in Europe, with more business being done on an FOB basis for financing. Also, much of the available inventory is not where it is needed or easily taken up.

"There is a lot of "dead' stock around. Liverpool, for instance, is very expensive to take up," one said.

Latest LME inventory data shows that there are just under 300,000 tonnes of aluminium stockpiled in Liverpool, while Rotterdam holds 105,600 tonnes.

Another factor feeding pressure throughout the premium structure is a shortage of Russian off-grades. Production methods in Russia are improving, and with rolling mills in the West increasingly using A6, there is a double impact on premiums, traders said.
