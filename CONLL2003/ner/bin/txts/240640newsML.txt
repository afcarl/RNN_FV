Man slashes own throat in Britain's High Court.

LONDON 1996-12-06

A Briton slashed his throat in London's High Court on Friday after he lost a property battle over a sports club.

As Judge John Goldring explained legal points after giving his judgment, Edward Mason, of Orpington in southern England, pulled a knife from his pocket and slit his throat.

With blood gushing from the wound he rushed out of the court and did it again.

"The man suddenly emerged on the steps of the court shouting at people to stay away and then he shouted "You call this justice,'" said freelance photographer James Horton.

"He then put the knife to his left ear and slowly drew it across his throat. There was blood everywhere. It spurted out all over his clothes and on to the pavement below" Horton said.

Mason, who had claimed he could lose up to three million pounds ($5 million) and his home if the case went against him, was being treated at St Thomas's Hospital in London.

A hospital spokesman was not immediately available to comment on Mason's condition but emergency service sources said it was not thought to be life threatening. ($1=.6082 Pound)
