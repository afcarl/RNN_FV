LIFFE cocoa backs off from rising streak, eyes NY.

LONDON 1996-12-06

London cocoa futures backed off after Thursday's rally as traders waited to see whether New York would lead another upward push.

Friday's early session absorbed some origin selling but the market was generally holding gains which enabled benchmark March cocoa to close above the initial resistance of 950 stg.

"We are expecting more follow through in the U.S.," said one trader.

London cocoa did not react to U.S. central bank chief Alan Greenspan's anti-inflation comments that pummeled the dollar and European bourses on Friday while gold was a big winner.

March cocoa stood two stg down at 950 stg a tonne at midday after trading in a seven stg range from 949 to 956. Other contracts lost up to four stg.

Traders said U.S. funds could be more easily enticed into the market. In London they seemed to be unenthusiastic below 975-980 stg levels on March.

Technical analysts expected some further gains in London but resistance was weighing heavy.

"Prices have managed to clear initial resistance, suggesting strongly we have seen the lows," said Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge. "However, upside potential does not look large." March has resistance at a chart gap between 954 and 956 stg, followed by 968.

Volume totalled 1,965 lots at midsession. The March/May was bid at 20 stg. Distant Dec/March traded at 12 stg.

Traders are awaiting weekly cocoa arrival figures from Ivory Coast to set the market tone.
