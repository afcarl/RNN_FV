<headline>LIFFE cocoa backs off from rising streak, eyes NY.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>London cocoa futures backed off after Thursday's rally as traders waited to see whether New York would lead another upward push.</p>
<p>Friday's early session absorbed some origin selling but the market was generally holding gains which enabled benchmark March cocoa to close above the initial resistance of 950 stg.</p>
<p>&quot;We are expecting more follow through in the U.S.,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>London cocoa did not react to U.S. central bank chief Alan Greenspan's anti-inflation comments that pummeled the dollar and European bourses on Friday while gold was a big winner.</p>
<p>March cocoa stood two stg down at 950 stg a tonne at midday after trading in a seven stg range from 949 to 956. Other contracts lost up to four stg.</p>
<p>Traders said U.S. funds could be more easily enticed into the market. In London they seemed to be unenthusiastic below 975-980 stg levels on March.</p>
<p>Technical analysts expected some further gains in London but resistance was weighing heavy.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices have managed to clear initial resistance, suggesting strongly we have seen the lows,&quot; said Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge. &quot;However, upside potential does not look large.&quot; March has resistance at a chart gap between 954 and 956 stg, followed by 968.</p>
<p>Volume totalled 1,965 lots at midsession. The March/May was bid at 20 stg. Distant Dec/March traded at 12 stg.</p>
<p>Traders are awaiting weekly cocoa arrival figures from Ivory Coast to set the market tone.</p>
