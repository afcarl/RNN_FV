Polaroid Europe to have new facility in Glasgow.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Polaroid Europe Ltd, part of Polaroid Corporation, said on Friday that it was setting up a new customer service and financial administrative centre in Glasgow, Scotland, to be operational by mid-January 1997.

In a statement, the company said the centre would employ about 150 people at the centre.

Brian Poggi, Polaroid Corporation's vice president, said it would relieve its 25 European and regional offices of administrative tasks, allowing them to concentrate on marketing activities, customer management and sales and additional services in developing markets in West Asia and Africa.
