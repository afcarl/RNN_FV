<p>NWE naphtha prices were steady to slightly higher on Friday, catching up to crude's explosive rally late Thursday then easing back as crude relinquished more than half those gains on Friday.</p>
<p>End-users continued to argue that demand was lacklustre but other traders said the strong undertone was confirmed by a cargo sold late Thursday at $229 cif into Spain.</p>
<p>Dec swaps were unchanged at $232/$233 and Jan rose $1.50 to $228.50/$229.50.</p>
<p>Barges were offered at $230/$231 fob ARA, unchanged to down $1 from Thursday. Cargoes were notionally valued at $232/$234 cif, traders said.</p>
<p>The 26,000 tonne cargo of 78 paraffinic material was sold to an end-user for delivery Dec 12-20 into Tarragona, Spain, traders said.</p>
<p>An Algerian cargo initially expected to end up in Antwerp was also believed heading to the U.S., confirming speculation of arbitrage interest to the States, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think most buyers are quite relaxed,&quot; said a trader at a Belgian refinery. &quot;I don't think anybody is in a hurry to buy at these high prices.&quot;</p>
<p>He was offering 10,000 tonnes of full range material for the second half of December at about $230-$231 fob ARA, with no visible buyers.</p>
<p>A 2,000 tonne full range barge was sold Thursday on a private and confidential basis, he said.</p>
<p>Heavier naphthenic and aromatic (N+A) material was still seen readily available due to poor reforming margins.</p>
