NWE fuel oil wobbles on lower crude,but finds feet.

LONDON 1996-12-06

The hiccup in crude's latest rally brought an abrupt end to NWE fuel oil's push higher.

Dealers said high sulphur barges came under strong selling pressure in the morning with the low $120s fob ARA heard, but by midday the market had rebounded to $124-125 fob a tonne, although shipper demand was poor.

High sulphur cargoes, which have owed much of their strength to crude, suffered a slight blip on Friday amid concern that U.S. fuel may threaten the European market.

An outage at one, maybe two, coking units in the U.S. might lead to American fuel coming transatlantic as the arb is open.

Some traders thought U.S. fuel oil would flood the European market while others said American utilities will buy the surplus fuel given current firm natural gas prices in the U.S.

Turkish and Portuguese tenders have to be filled and NWE utilities were "lurking in the wings". But pricing pressure and talk of Med material possibly heading north were acting as a counterweight and cargoes were around $123 cif NWE.

The low sulphur market was holding steady with fundamentally good interest from a Turkish tender that has to be met and some end-user demand. Wet barrels were pegged close to December swaps of $135-136 fob NWE. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8980
