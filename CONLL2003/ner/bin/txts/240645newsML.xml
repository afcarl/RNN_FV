<headline>NWE fuel oil wobbles on lower crude,but finds feet.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>The hiccup in crude's latest rally brought an abrupt end to NWE fuel oil's push higher.</p>
<p>Dealers said high sulphur barges came under strong selling pressure in the morning with the low $120s fob ARA heard, but by midday the market had rebounded to $124-125 fob a tonne, although shipper demand was poor.</p>
<p>High sulphur cargoes, which have owed much of their strength to crude, suffered a slight blip on Friday amid concern that U.S. fuel may threaten the European market.</p>
<p>An outage at one, maybe two, coking units in the U.S. might lead to American fuel coming transatlantic as the arb is open.</p>
<p>Some traders thought U.S. fuel oil would flood the European market while others said American utilities will buy the surplus fuel given current firm natural gas prices in the U.S.</p>
<p>Turkish and Portuguese tenders have to be filled and NWE utilities were &quot;lurking in the wings&quot;. But pricing pressure and talk of Med material possibly heading north were acting as a counterweight and cargoes were around $123 cif NWE.</p>
<p>The low sulphur market was holding steady with fundamentally good interest from a Turkish tender that has to be met and some end-user demand. Wet barrels were pegged close to December swaps of $135-136 fob NWE. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8980</p>
