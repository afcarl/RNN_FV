IPE futures fall sharply on news of Iraqi oil sale.

LONDON 1996-12-06

IPE crude oil futures sank deeper into negative territory after an unconfirmed report from Iraq that it would resume crude exports early next week circulated in an already weaker market.

"It's down because of the headline that Iraq is to resume exports on Tuesday," a futures broker said.

January Brent was trading 48 cents off at $24.15 a barrel at 1302 GMT. Gas oil for December was off $2.50 at $227 a tonne.

The broker said the other factor was the weaker stock market and fears it would have a knock-on effect on commodity prices.  

The reports, which have not yet been confirmed, spoke of Iraq restarting oil flows for export on Tuesday morning, far earlier than the market had anticipated.

Iraq is due to start exporting $2.0 billion in crude  for six months to buy food and medicines under the "oil-for-food" plan agreed with the United Nations.

This would translate into 500,000-600,000 barrels per day (bpd) and represent the first Iraqi oil exports since the United Nations slapped a ban on Iraqi crude sales following Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.  

Prices were softer earlier on Friday in what brokers said was profit-taking after the week's sharp gains.
