<title>UK: IPE futures fall sharply on news of Iraqi oil sale.</title>
<headline>IPE futures fall sharply on news of Iraqi oil sale.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE crude oil futures sank deeper into negative territory after an unconfirmed report from Iraq that it would resume crude exports early next week circulated in an already weaker market.</p>
<p>&quot;It's down because of the headline that Iraq is to resume exports on Tuesday,&quot; a futures broker said.</p>
<p>January Brent was trading 48 cents off at $24.15 a barrel at 1302 GMT. Gas oil for December was off $2.50 at $227 a tonne.</p>
<p>The broker said the other factor was the weaker stock market and fears it would have a knock-on effect on commodity prices.  </p>
<p>The reports, which have not yet been confirmed, spoke of Iraq restarting oil flows for export on Tuesday morning, far earlier than the market had anticipated.</p>
<p>Iraq is due to start exporting $2.0 billion in crude  for six months to buy food and medicines under the &quot;oil-for-food&quot; plan agreed with the United Nations.</p>
<p>This would translate into 500,000-600,000 barrels per day (bpd) and represent the first Iraqi oil exports since the United Nations slapped a ban on Iraqi crude sales following Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.  </p>
<p>Prices were softer earlier on Friday in what brokers said was profit-taking after the week's sharp gains.</p>
