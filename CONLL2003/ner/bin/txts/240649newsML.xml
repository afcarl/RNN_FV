<headline>Egypt seen major target for latest EU wheat sales.</headline>

<p>Egypt is likely to be the biggest destination for the wheat made available under Thursday's EU free market export tender, European exporters said. They see Saudi Arabia as the main home for the barley award.</p>
<p>French traders jumped on the release of more than 400,000 tonnes of soft wheat, double the previous week's sale, to push prices higher and several predicted they would keep going.</p>
<p>Rouen-delivered wheat gained five francs as soon as the EU tender results were announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's good news,&quot; said one French exporter. The fact that applicants for so much wheat could be found at a level which still does not make EU supplies competitive with Argentina shows that export trade is going well, traders said.</p>
<p>But a yawning differential between EU prices and competitive Argentine wheat still wrankles with French traders who accuse Brussels of losing them business by playing politics with the United States. Prices looked fragile after the initial gains.</p>
<p>The EU has pledged to keep exports roughly in line with U.S. wheat prices, a promise it appeared to keep on Thursday with a free-market wheat sale seen worth $148 to $149 a tonne.</p>
<p>Argentine wheat is worth closer to $130 a tonne. The EU looks set to shift some five million tonnes by the the end of the year, according to one of its biggest export traders. &quot;That's much more than people were expecting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He reckoned that much of the wheat would be destined for Egypt, although he did not say just how much. Another possible destination was Poland.</p>
<p>Another European exporter felt that Egypt was probably going to take 200,000 tonnes of Thursday's award. Morocco or Algeria could be taking much of the rest.</p>
<p>He also mentioned Poland as a likely destination, with the former Soviet Republics another possibility, although there had been talk of cancellations there.</p>
<p>The short haul freight advantage would help EU exporters sell wheat to eastern European countries. Difficulty competing with Argentina for traditional EU markets in North Africa were encouraging EU exporters to look east, traders added. Iraq, which has unfrozen $70 million worth of funds in a deal arranged by an Austrian firm, was another possible buyer.</p>
<p>The barley award demonstrated the EU Commission's desire to avoid letting the price fall, exporters said. Much of the barley is likely to be heading for Saudi Arabia, to cover the November 27 deal for 500,000 tonnes to be delivered by end-January, as well as the last remaining barley for earlier deals.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still some Saudi shorts around,&quot; one barley exporter said.</p>
<p>The EU refund, of 30.99 Ecu per tonne, to be paid on 211,000 tonnes of barley is equivalent to $132 per tonne fob for European barley. Transport cost should bring that up to a figure in the $154-$156 range that the Saudi deal was done at.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more interesting for the Saudi business, about 40,000 tonnes of barley was sold from Danish intervention at a price traders valued at $130 per tonne fob.</p>
<p>Australia is another likely origin for the latest Saudi barley. &quot;But Australia can't do half a million tonnes,&quot; the barley exporter said. Canada was also likely to send some barley to Saudi, he said.</p>
<p>A minor sale of 5,500 tonnes of Scandinavian oats is likely to go to eastern Europe or Switzerland rather than the main market in the United States, one Europoean trader said.</p>
<p>A sale of 52,000 tonnes of German intervention rye was worth $127 a tonne and will probably go to South Korea, traders said.</p>
