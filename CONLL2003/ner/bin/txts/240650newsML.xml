<headline>INTERVIEW - CE hopes Northern to recommend bid.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>CE Electric hopes that its final, increased 650 pence per share offer for British regional electricity company (Rec) Northern Electric will be recommended by Northern, chairman David Sokol told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;I would hope so. It is a good opportunity for shareholders and I would hope the board (of Northern) would concur,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>CE Electric, which is 70 percent owned by U.S. group CalEnergy, said on Friday it had raised its offer to 650 pence from 630 pence previously and put a final deadline of December 20 on acceptances.  </p>
<p>The new offer values Northern at around 766 million pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an overwhelmingly strong offer,&quot; Sokol said.</p>
<p>He said although Northern had not produced any new information in its two defence documents to persuade CE Electric to raise its price, CE Electric had been holding &quot;a certain amount of dollars&quot; back in hopes of a recommendation.</p>
<p>But Sokol said his company had decided to raise its offer because it was unfair to withhold the cash from shareholders in the absence of such a recommendation.</p>
<p>Sokol said CE Electric had decided to set the December 20 deadline because it would reassure employees and shareholders ahead of the Christmas holiday period.</p>
<p>It would also avoid any conflict with the regulatory timetable as trade and industry minister Ian Lang is expected to decide whether the bid can go ahead by December 16, he added.</p>
<p>Northern has said the original 630 pence per share bid undervalued the company and that a price of 700 pence was mentioned before CE Electric launched its offer, despite denials from the American group.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been made clear that Northern would sell at 700 pence,&quot; Sokol said, &quot;but we do not believe the value is anywhere near 700 pence.&quot;</p>
<p>CE Electric has snapped up nearly 30 percent of the company on the market already as Northern's share price languished under concerns that Lang would block the bid.</p>
<p>Northern's shares were up 1.5 pence at 602.5 pence by 1304 GMT, off a low of 585 pence for the day.</p>
