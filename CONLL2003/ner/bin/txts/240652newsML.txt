British interest rates seen steady until January.

British chancellor Kenneth Clarke will almost certa inly leave official interest rates steady at 6.0 percent at his monetary meeting on Wednesday with Bank of England governor Eddie George, a Reuters survey showed.

Twenty out of 21 leading economists polled said they expected no rate move after comments by George to the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee on Thursday.

The governor said Clarke was "up with the game" when he raised rates by 25 basis points to 6.0 percent in October, and said he saw no "urgent" need for another rate hike -- yet.

Economists said that this, combined with a fiscally tight budget, had effectively let Clarke off the hook in December.

"The budget made a rate rise less likely and now that Eddie George has said he sees the budget as having a contractionary effect, so the fact that the Bank isn't pushing so hard makes it easier for Clarke," said Thomas Rayner, international economist at Societe Generale.

However, many economists warned that Clarke and George could yet deliver a surprise move, catching the markets out in the same way they did on October 30 when they raised rates against expectations.

Since most analysts expect an upward move in January or February, a potential move in December could have the advantage of getting the bad news on rates out of the way ahead of next year's general election, due by May.

Nineteen of the 21 economists predicted Clarke would have to raise rates by an average of 25 basis points before the general election which must be held on or before May 22 next year.

Late January or early February seemed likely, allowing Clarke to digest both the Christmas retail sales figures and a preliminary estimate for fourth quarter GDP (gross domestic product) -- thus avoiding bad publicity just before the holiday season, economists said.

"He's a politician and the headlines wouldn't read very well -- 'Mortgage rates up, Happy Christmas, love Ken Clarke'," said Geoffrey Dicks, economist at Natwest Markets.

And mixed economic data would also permit Clarke to hang fire until the new year before making any policy changes.

"The chancellor will argue that with the recovery and manufacturing activity not yet assured, sterling's strength, and pipeline pressures still very weak indeed...there's sufficient ambiguity in the data to justify a 'wait-and-see' approach over this month," said Alex Garrard, UK economist at UBS.

A November survey from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) released on Thursday showed a slowdown in retail trade, with severe competition among retailers keeping a lid on prices.

"The CBI survey was not as bullish as the more excessive inflation hawks in the City had been suggesting", said James Stewart, chief economist at SE-Banken.

"I think the chancellor is quite right to err on the side of caution. He would be justified in waiting and he might sanction another 25 basis points in February," added Stewart.

But Philip Shaw, chief economist at Union Discount reckoned Clarke would be better off getting all the bad news out of the way to start 1997 with a clean sheet.

"I think it's unlikely that a rate rise can be averted before a general election...therefore there may be some political advantage for the chancellor to move now and leave 1997 free for the Conservative party to campaign with a much reduced chance of rates having to go up again," said Shaw.

"The most damaging thing for the government would be to raise rates just ahead of the election, and I think by moving next week, the prospect of doing that would be averted".
