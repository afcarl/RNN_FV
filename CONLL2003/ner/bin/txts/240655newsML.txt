FORECAST-Daily Mail full-yr set to rise.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Full-year profits from newspaper publisher Daily Mail & General Trust Plc are set to rise despite higher newsprint costs and heavy marketing spend, analysts said.

Analysts are forcasting pre-tax profit in a range of 81-90 million stg, against a figure, excluding exceptional items, of 80.0 million stg a year ago. The company will report figures for the year to end-September on Thursday.

The company's flagship Daily Mail newspaper has strengthened its grip on the mid-market sector, boosting its average sale to over two million copies. However, higher costs will hit margins at national press division Associated Newspapers.  

"Margins at Associated could be down to about seven percent in the period, largely reflecting paper costs," said Anthony de Larrinaga of Panmure Gordon.

But he added that Associated had a "fantastic" growth record and that the benefits of increased circulation would really be felt in the current year as advertising rates rose and newsprint costs declined.

Panmure is forecasting 1996 group pre-tax profit of 89.2 million stg, excluding exceptional gains of 3.4 million stg. Its 1997 forecast is 121 million stg.
