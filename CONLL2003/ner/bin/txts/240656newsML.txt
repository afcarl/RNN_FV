Soccer star Gullit to cash in on "Ruud" clothing.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Ruud Gullit, player-manager of English soccer club Chelsea, is to have a range of casual clothing named after him under a five-year deal with a British sports and leisurewear firm, the company said on Friday.

The dreadlocked Dutchman will be paid an initial six-figure sum and also receive royalties on worldwide sales of the clothes marketed by Hay & Robertson.

It plans to produce a wide range of leisure clothing from tops to underwear which it will market under the new "Ruud" label of its Admiral brand.

"We're delighted that we have attracted such a high profile figure," said Hay & Robertson chief executive Lance Yates. "He's stylish, a great role model and very eloquent."

Image-conscious Gullit, 34, is expected to play a role in styling the clothes which will carry his name.

"We've had a succession of development meetings and he's had a lot of input and will work with us on developing the range," Yates said.

Gullit has been one of the most popular and successful players in world soccer over the past decade in a career which has taken him from his native Netherlands to Italy and then on to England.

Hay & Robertson hope that his involvement will help to revitalise the Admiral brand, which dominated the British soccer kit market in the 1970s but now supplies only a handful of lower division clubs. ($1=.6161 Pound)
