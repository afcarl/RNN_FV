<title>UK: Soccer star Gullit to cash in on &quot;Ruud&quot; clothing.</title>
<headline>Soccer star Gullit to cash in on &quot;Ruud&quot; clothing.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Ruud Gullit, player-manager of English soccer club Chelsea, is to have a range of casual clothing named after him under a five-year deal with a British sports and leisurewear firm, the company said on Friday.</p>
<p>The dreadlocked Dutchman will be paid an initial six-figure sum and also receive royalties on worldwide sales of the clothes marketed by Hay &amp; Robertson.</p>
<p>It plans to produce a wide range of leisure clothing from tops to underwear which it will market under the new &quot;Ruud&quot; label of its Admiral brand.</p>
<p>&quot;We're delighted that we have attracted such a high profile figure,&quot; said Hay &amp; Robertson chief executive Lance Yates. &quot;He's stylish, a great role model and very eloquent.&quot;</p>
<p>Image-conscious Gullit, 34, is expected to play a role in styling the clothes which will carry his name.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had a succession of development meetings and he's had a lot of input and will work with us on developing the range,&quot; Yates said.</p>
<p>Gullit has been one of the most popular and successful players in world soccer over the past decade in a career which has taken him from his native Netherlands to Italy and then on to England.</p>
<p>Hay &amp; Robertson hope that his involvement will help to revitalise the Admiral brand, which dominated the British soccer kit market in the 1970s but now supplies only a handful of lower division clubs. ($1=.6161 Pound)</p>
