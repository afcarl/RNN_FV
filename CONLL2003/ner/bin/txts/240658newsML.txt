British Telecom bucks bearish FTSE 100.

LONDON 1996-12-06

British Telecommunications Plc shares fell on Friday but traders said the stock was resisting the worst of a huge market plunge which saw London's FTSE 100 index lose over 150 points or 3.75 pct.

By 1225 GMT, BT shares were down 9p to 390-1/2 as trading volume pushed towards 17 million shares. It was the second most active stock and the slide of 2.25 percent was well under the average FTSE index fall of 3.6 percent.

"BT tends to be a defensive stock," said one analyst. "The Concert story is a very strong feature," he added.

BT and MCI of the U.S. announced earlier this year they will merge into a $20 billion company to be known as Concert.

Also helping BT shares weather the storm was news that the Japanese authorities will allow Japanese telecommunications giant NTT to offer international services.

BT welcomed the news saying it has long wanted to set up a partnership with NTT. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717.
