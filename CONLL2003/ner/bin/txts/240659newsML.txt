OPTIONS - BTP vols set to climb as futures plunge.

Implied volatility levels of options on BTP futures traded on LIFFE were up on Friday and were expected to head higher in the near term, brokers said.

The underlying future was affected by the sharp sell off in global bonds following comments from U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warning that the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" effected stock and other asset markets because this could damage the economy.

"We'll soon see volatility one point higher because the jitters will get stronger," said a broker at a US bank in Milan.

Implied volatility on March options of BTPs were quoted at around 8.10/8.20 percent compared with 7.80 percent at Thursday's close.

The underlying March BTP future was at 126.49 at 1216 GMT, down 212 basis points on the day.

"Before this week volatility was up to really high levels, almost 9.0 percent," said a broker at an Italian bank in London.

"Then people realised it was too high and there was an aggressive sell-off which dragged it down. In a sense it overreacted on the upside and then perhaps it overreacted again on the downside."

He said investors were wary, despite the recent resilience of the Italian market, because of the vulnerability of the U.S. and German bond markets.

The market was also nervous ahead of the key U.S. November non-farm payrolls data, due at 1330 GMT. The data is forecast to rise 179,000, compared with a 210,000 rise previously.

Brokers said pre-payroll nerves did not generally affect the Italian market too much but after the sharp overnight correction there could be a short squeeze following the data, although this should no impact volatility too much.

During the session so far there has been some activity in the options market, they said. This had mostly centred on the puts, which had become a little more expensive, and people were trading the straddle.

Volatility was set to rise ahead of the European Union summit of heads of state and government in Dublin on December 13 and 14, brokers said.

"We might expect a bit of volatility before that," the Italian bank broker said. "But people don't want to buy volatility aggressively on the March because if you buy now you could have a week or two of activity and then you've got a couple of dead weeks."

He said if investors did buy March vol now, they should spread the risk against something else.

"I wouldn't go outright long going right into the holiday. You'd get killed by time decay," he said. "That should keep a cap on volatility. Then maybe in the new year it will pick up again."
