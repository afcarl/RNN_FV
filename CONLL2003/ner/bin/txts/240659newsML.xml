<p>Implied volatility levels of options on BTP futures traded on LIFFE were up on Friday and were expected to head higher in the near term, brokers said.</p>
<p>The underlying future was affected by the sharp sell off in global bonds following comments from U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warning that the Fed must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; effected stock and other asset markets because this could damage the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll soon see volatility one point higher because the jitters will get stronger,&quot; said a broker at a US bank in Milan.</p>
<p>Implied volatility on March options of BTPs were quoted at around 8.10/8.20 percent compared with 7.80 percent at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>The underlying March BTP future was at 126.49 at 1216 GMT, down 212 basis points on the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Before this week volatility was up to really high levels, almost 9.0 percent,&quot; said a broker at an Italian bank in London.</p>
<p>&quot;Then people realised it was too high and there was an aggressive sell-off which dragged it down. In a sense it overreacted on the upside and then perhaps it overreacted again on the downside.&quot;</p>
<p>He said investors were wary, despite the recent resilience of the Italian market, because of the vulnerability of the U.S. and German bond markets.</p>
<p>The market was also nervous ahead of the key U.S. November non-farm payrolls data, due at 1330 GMT. The data is forecast to rise 179,000, compared with a 210,000 rise previously.</p>
<p>Brokers said pre-payroll nerves did not generally affect the Italian market too much but after the sharp overnight correction there could be a short squeeze following the data, although this should no impact volatility too much.</p>
<p>During the session so far there has been some activity in the options market, they said. This had mostly centred on the puts, which had become a little more expensive, and people were trading the straddle.</p>
<p>Volatility was set to rise ahead of the European Union summit of heads of state and government in Dublin on December 13 and 14, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We might expect a bit of volatility before that,&quot; the Italian bank broker said. &quot;But people don't want to buy volatility aggressively on the March because if you buy now you could have a week or two of activity and then you've got a couple of dead weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>He said if investors did buy March vol now, they should spread the risk against something else.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't go outright long going right into the holiday. You'd get killed by time decay,&quot; he said. &quot;That should keep a cap on volatility. Then maybe in the new year it will pick up again.&quot;</p>
