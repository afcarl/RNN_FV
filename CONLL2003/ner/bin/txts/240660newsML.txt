CE raises Northern bid by final 20p.

LONDON 1996-12-06

U.S. utility CalEnergy Co Inc said on Friday it was raising its hostile takeover offer for British regional electricity company Northern Electric Plc (Northern) to 650 pence cash per ordinary share from 630 pence.

The company also said its offers would be open for acceptance until 1300 GMT on December 20.  

CE said its final offer represented full value for Northern as it was "more favourable than the agreed bid for East Midlands (a similar UK company) and the previous offer for Northern Electric by Trafalgar House".

"The time is now right for shareholders to decide for themselves on the merits of our final offers which represent compelling value," the statement quoted CE Electric chief executive David Sokol as saying.

As well as the 650 pence per ordinary share, CE is also offering 105 pence per preference share.

After the raised bid was announced, Northern's share price climbed sharply off its earlier trading lows to stand at 606-1/2 pence, up 5-1/2 pence, having earlier dipped to 585 pence in a sharply lower London stock market.
