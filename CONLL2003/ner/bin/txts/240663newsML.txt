GB Railways wins first franchise, Britain's 16th.

LONDON 1996-12-06

A new company, GB Railways Group Plc, won its first passenger rail operating franchise on Friday when it was awarded a seven-year contract to run Anglia rail.

Anglia train operating company is the 16th of 25 such lines to be privatised by the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf), the government agency responsible for the process.

"The award of this, the 16th franchise, heralds the arrival of yet another new entrant to the rail sector and underscores the high level of interest and quality of bids for franchises," Opraf director John O'Brien said in a statement.

GB is also committed to investing in leased rolling stock.  

The franchise will run for just over seven years and during its life GB will received subsidies falling from 35.9 million stg in the frst year to 6.3 million stg in 2003/04. Passenger revenue for the year ended March 31 was 38 million stg.

"By September 2000 GN Railways will introduce a half-hourly weekday service on the London Liverpool Street-Norwich route which will have the effect of doubling the frequency of off-peak services. GB will also reduce the journey times and lease a fleet of modern, air-conditioned trains for us on this route," Opraf's statement added.

Other promised passenger improvements will include providing a coach link between Colchester and Stansted Airport.

No details were initally avaiable of how GB Railways intended to raise the capital it will need to comply with regulatory requirements applying to all franchise winners.
