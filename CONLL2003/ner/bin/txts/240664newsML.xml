<p>European debt futures are doomed to fail in any attempt to chart new highs before the year is out, technical analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>A sharp sell-off, sparked by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, inflicted some serious damage to technical analysts' price charts, leaving the outlook bleak until early 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a serious correction going on, and we've seen some heavy technical damage,&quot; said Guenter Redeker, a chartist at Chase in London.</p>
<p>&quot;This implies that for the next four weeks we will definitely not see new highs in the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Just days after debt futures across Europe powered to fresh all-time highs, a warning from Greenspan that financial markets were showing signs of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; sent bond prices plummeting early on Friday. German Bund futures plunged 86 basis points at the open, shadowing a 1-1/2 point fall in the U.S. long bond overnight.</p>
<p>French notionnel futures cracked through a medium term upchannel, leaving a large gap on daily price charts and signalling more weakness ahead, while March gilt futures also tumbled through technical supports.</p>
<p>Analysts said it was still too early to tell whether 1997 would be a year for bond bears or bulls, but said charts showed that a rally into the end of this year was pretty much out of the question.</p>
<p>&quot;The jury is still out on the overall trend, but for the rest of December we've done some pretty heavy damage and are going to struggle a bit,&quot; said Karl Haeling, director of futures and options for Germany at DMG Futures and Options in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Coming so close to the end of the year, Haeling said Friday's stinging fall would prompt players to get out of the market, taking their profits for the year while they could.</p>
<p>&quot;Few buyers are going to step up and take on more risk. People will be looking for any upmove, saying &quot;hey here's my chance to get out',&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In Bund futures, Europe's benchmark market, Chase's Redeker said 100.08 was a key retracement level. The March Bund contract was trading at 100.00 by 1122 GMT, down 70 basis points on the day.</p>
<p>&quot;If the market can stabilise and manage to close above 100.08 today, then I would start looking for a bottom building process,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But after such a sharp setback, the market will need time to consolidate. &quot;It will take a period for the market to build a solid platform,&quot; said Redeker.</p>
<p>If Bunds failed to hold above that level, the risk was for more profound weakness, with downside targets at 99.75 and 99.00 luring the contract lower, chartists said.</p>
<p>In T-bonds, where the technical pain came hot on the heels of Greenspan's words and swiftly infected European markets, chartists said an important pattern on weekly price charts was the key to the outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had an outside week. That means the market is rejecting the upside,&quot; said Gerry Celaya, senior technical analyst at American Express Bank in London.</p>
<p>An outside week pattern occurs when charts show a higher high and a lower low than were plotted in the previous week.</p>
<p>March T-bond futures, trading in automated business before the U.S. market opens, were more than one full point lower at 113-06 by 1123 GMT.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said 112-09 was a critical level for this market, since it represented a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from early September at 105-14, to Tuesday's high at 116-17.</p>
<p>If that level is broken, more sharp declines are on the cards for U.S. debt futures, with T-bonds on the road to 110-23, chartists said.</p>
