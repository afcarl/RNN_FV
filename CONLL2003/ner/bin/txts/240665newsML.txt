UK's Major says Clarke enjoys his full support.

LONDON 1996-12-06

British Prime Minister John Major said on Friday that Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke enjoyed his full support.

According to Britain's Press Association news agency, Major told reporters outside a school in his constituency: "If the Chancellor didn't enjoy my full support, he wouldn't be Chancellor. Of course he does."  

Major was speaking after a day of feverish media claims and counter claims about whether Clarke had threatened to resign if Major had hardened his position on a single European currency.

Clarke denied he had threatened to resign. But the reports were given weight by the revelation that the BBC reporters who broke the story had earlier lunched with Clarke.

Major said on Friday: "We have set out our policy on the single currency for a very long time. We have discussed this at length at the party conference. It was very solidly endorsed there and it's been Cabinet policy for a very long time." -- London Newsroom +44-171-542-7768
