<headline>UK's Major says Clarke enjoys his full support.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>British Prime Minister John Major said on Friday that Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke enjoyed his full support.</p>
<p>According to Britain's Press Association news agency, Major told reporters outside a school in his constituency: &quot;If the Chancellor didn't enjoy my full support, he wouldn't be Chancellor. Of course he does.&quot;  </p>
<p>Major was speaking after a day of feverish media claims and counter claims about whether Clarke had threatened to resign if Major had hardened his position on a single European currency.</p>
<p>Clarke denied he had threatened to resign. But the reports were given weight by the revelation that the BBC reporters who broke the story had earlier lunched with Clarke.</p>
<p>Major said on Friday: &quot;We have set out our policy on the single currency for a very long time. We have discussed this at length at the party conference. It was very solidly endorsed there and it's been Cabinet policy for a very long time.&quot; -- London Newsroom +44-171-542-7768</p>
