UK Triplex criticises Cook's promises.

LONDON 1996-12-06

British engineering group Triplex Lloyd Plc said on Friday that takeover target William Cook was exaggerating its potential and was not able to assess its own prospects properly.

William Cook, a manufacturer of casting steel had sought to fight off an unsolicited bid from Triplex on Friday by promising a substantial profit rise. It promised to publish a full profit forecast for the current year which would show a substantial improvement over the previous year.

Triplex responded by saying: "William Cook's new claims and previous statements about its prospects are inconsistent".
