Banks lead London shares lower on rate fears.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Bank stocks led the London share market lower on Friday registering big losses as a speech by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan spooked investors into fearing higher interest rates.

Bank stocks are hit when the market sees rates going higher almost by tradition.

"When interest rates go up, people borrow less and bad debts increase -- none of which is good for banks," said one analyst.

Traders also said that banks have recently been outperforming the market.  

"The market's short so the market makers are taking the opportunity to squeeze them," said one trader.

In a speech on Thursday, the Fed chief said the central bank had to be wary of "irrational exuberance" infecting stock and other asset markets.

Greenspan added, "We as central bankers need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy, its production, jobs and price stability. Indeed, the sharp stock market break of 1987 had few negative consequences for the economy."

Among bank stocks at 1150 GMT, HSBC dropped 63-1/2p to 12.60 stg, Barclays was down 45-1/2p to 988-1/2, Standard Chartered fell 45-1/2p to 651-1/2 while National Westminster lost 31p to stand at 667.

Traders said HSBC shares had been hard hit in the Hong Kong market on the interest rate concerns which had led to heavy selling of Hong Kong property stocks. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717
