S&P cuts outlook on Henkel to negative.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Standard and Poor's rating agency said on Friday it had cut the outlook on Germany's Henkel to negative from stable but affirmed its long-term AA minus and short-term A1 plus ratings.  

S&P also said it had removed Henkel's reating from CreditWatch where they were placed on October 28.

"The outlook revision reflects the debt-financed nature of the $1.3 billion acquisition (of Loctite Corp ) which will broadly double Henkel's net debt," S&P said in a statement.

"Henkel's financial profile will be at the very low end of the range acceptable for the currenct ratings," it said.

It said Henkel's rating could be reviewed if its financial profile did not improve as envisaged.
