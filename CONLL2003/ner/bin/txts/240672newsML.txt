LONDON 1996-12-06

Qatar, OPEC's smallest producer, told the group's Secretariat it produced 392,000 barrels per day of crude oil in November, slightly over its 378,000 bpd quota.

The OPEC News Agency (OPECNA) on Friday provided the first official November production and supply figures provided to the Vienna-based Secretariat from member countries.

OPEC quotas are based on supply to the market, defined to exclude movements to, but not sales from, storage.

Table of those member countries that have provided data so far are as follows (in thousands of barrels per day):

 COUNTRY	   PRODUCTION    SUPPLY

 ALGERIA	     795.0	  773.0

 INDONESIA	 1,327.4	   N.A.

 KUWAIT	    2,001.8	   N.A.

 LIBYA	     1,400.0	   N.A.

 QATAR		 392.2	  382.3
