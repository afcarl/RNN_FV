<p>High-flying Italy topped the league in a week of meagre returns on government bonds, Salomon Brothers said on Friday.</p>
<p>In local currency terms, Italian BTPs offered returns of 0.85 percent in the week ended on Thursday, with fellow high-yielder Sweden close behind on 0.80 percent.</p>
<p>The weekly government bond index rose 0.07 percent in local currency terms. France managed third place with 0.68 percent in the 16-nation world government bond index.</p>
<p>Canada's were the worst performing bonds. They lost 2.21 percent, depressed by a wave of new Canadian supply.</p>
<p>Returns on Treasuries were also in negative territory at minus 0.24 percent, the poorest result after Canada and British gilts which lost 0.28 percent.</p>
<p>Australia was the only dollar-bloc country in the table to eke out a positive return, albeit a paltry 0.02 percent. German Bunds were not much better, offering returns of 0.05 percent, while Japanese government bonds managed a 0.38 percent gain.</p>
<p>Spanish bonds, which had been top performers in Salomon Brothers' league table for November as a whole, turned in a more subdued weekly performance with a return of only 0.27 percent. In U.S. dollar terms, Japan was the only country to give positive returns at 1.35 percent.</p>
<p>France lost 0.37 percent, followed by Italy on minus 0.59 percent.</p>
<p>The biggest losers in dollar terms were British gilts, which shed 3.41 percent, Canada with minus 3.03 percent and Australia at minus 1.54 percent.</p>
<p>Salomon's bond index is calculated using all government bonds with over one year to maturity, weighted for market capitalisation. Only bonds freely available to institutional investors and with a certain minimum amount outstanding are included. Returns take account of price moves and accrued interest.</p>
