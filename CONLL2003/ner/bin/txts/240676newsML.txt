Iran buys around six sugar cargoes for 1997 -trade.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Iran has bought around six cargoes of sugar from mixed origins for arrival in the first quarter of 1997, market sources said on Friday.

"It looks as if it was evenly split between January raws and March whites," a trader said. He cited a price of $268.00 per tonne for the raws and said the price for the whites had yet to be determined.

One physical broker said the raw sugar cargoes were likely to include one of Brazilian and one of Cuban origin. The exact number of cargoes purchased by Iran was as yet unclear.

The European Union, Thailand, Australia, Cuba and Brazil are among Iran's principal suppliers of sugar.

Traders said the white sugar purchases were likely to include European Union 45 ICUMSA cargoes, with possibly some Thai cargoes of the same quality.

"They do sometimes take Thais," another trader said.

Last month, traders in the Gulf said Iran was looking to buy around 170,000 tonnes of sugar for delivery in early 1997.

Iran has unveiled plans to achieve self-sufficiency in sugar within 10 years. In September it announced the establishment of seven cane refineries with an annual capacity of 100,000 tonnes each and also a 100,000-tonne beet refinery.

Local sugar output is said to have slumped this year and production of beet and cane is believed to be about 215,000 tonnes lower due to adverse weather conditions.
