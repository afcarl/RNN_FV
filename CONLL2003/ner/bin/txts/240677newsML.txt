London's FTSE share index falls over 2.5 percent.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading share prices skidded more than 100 points, or more than 2.5 percent, on Friday, chalking up its steepest one-day decline since October 1992.

The blue chip index shed 106.2 poiints to 3,945.0.  

London shares continued the sharp selloff that started in the Far East after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said the central bank had to be wary of "irrational exuberance" infecting stock and other asset markets. The FTSE 100 continued to drop and towards noon GMT was more than three percent lower, with index futures contracts below the cash market.

"We're going to see a very nervous UK market until we see how weak Wall Street is going to be and how long it takes to settle," said Tim Brown, equity strategist with UBS.

The Dow, up a staggaring 25 percent this year and thought to be ripe for a correction, was expected to open at least 100 points lower at the open.

"But in a couple months time, I think UK markets will recover their poise and stop going down," said Brown, who targets the 4,300 level by the end of 1997.
