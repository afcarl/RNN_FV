<p>Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading share prices skidded more than 100 points, or more than 2.5 percent, on Friday, chalking up its steepest one-day decline since October 1992.</p>
<p>The blue chip index shed 106.2 poiints to 3,945.0.  </p>
<p>London shares continued the sharp selloff that started in the Far East after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said the central bank had to be wary of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infecting stock and other asset markets. The FTSE 100 continued to drop and towards noon GMT was more than three percent lower, with index futures contracts below the cash market.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to see a very nervous UK market until we see how weak Wall Street is going to be and how long it takes to settle,&quot; said Tim Brown, equity strategist with UBS.</p>
<p>The Dow, up a staggaring 25 percent this year and thought to be ripe for a correction, was expected to open at least 100 points lower at the open.</p>
<p>&quot;But in a couple months time, I think UK markets will recover their poise and stop going down,&quot; said Brown, who targets the 4,300 level by the end of 1997.</p>
