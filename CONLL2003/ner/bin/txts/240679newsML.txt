UK credit, debit card spending seen at new high.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Credit and debit card spending in Britain is poised to hit a new high of 9.2 billion stg, or some 300 million stg a day, over the Christmas period, the Credit Card Research Group.

It forecast credit card spending at a record 4.9 billion stg and debit card expenditure at 4.3 billion stg in December.

The group said it expected book shops, record stores and gift shops to benefit most from consumer spending, with clothing and department store sales rising sharply as well.

Card spending in sectors such as hotels and travel would remain static, or even decline slightly, compared to the rest of the year. Restaurants, cinemas and theatres would all benefit from Christmas cheer.

The majority of Christmas food and drink would be paid for by debit cards, which will overtake credit cards in popularity within a couple of years, the group said.

"After the annual plastic bonanza in December, there is an inevitable hangover in the early months of the following year," the group added.

"Regarding credit cards, people take advantage of the interest-free period over Christmas before cutting back in January and February in order to pay off their Christmas excesses."
