Intrepid Energy raises $74 mln for North Sea buys.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Privately-owned Intrepid Energy North Sea Ltd on Friday said it has succeeded in raising $74 million from U.S. institutional investors for investments in proven North Sea oil and gas projects.

The London-based company, led by former Santa Fe Exploration chief Michael Lynch, expects to raise at least another $75 million for purchases of interests in fields which oil majors want to divest, a spokesman for Intrepid said.

He added that Intrepid's war chest currently totals $300 million. Intrepid is already negotiating on possible acquisitions, he said.
