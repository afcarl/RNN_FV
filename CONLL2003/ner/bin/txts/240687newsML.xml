<title>UK: UK watchdog not to refer underwriting issue to MMC.</title>
<headline>UK watchdog not to refer underwriting issue to MMC.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Britain's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said on Friday that it was not referring the underwriting of equity issues to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC).  </p>
<p>Bridgeman welcomed the recent initiatives of various trade associations. &quot;Some tangible evidence of change is provided by a number of well-publicised recent rights issue that have been carried out in innovative ways, to the benefit of the issuing company.&quot;</p>
<p>Bridgeman was referring to recent moves by some banks to launch issues for companies with a feature that allows variable sub-underwriting fees within a tendering process.</p>
<p>Merchant bank Schroders broke new ground in October in UK institutional underwriting when it used a tender within a 222 million pound rights issue for hotels group Stakis Plc.  </p>
<p>The main result was to reduce the commission bill for Stakis, as the bank passed on pro-rata the reductions it achieved in the total sub-underwriting commissions. Schroders offered the same benefit a week later to More Plc.</p>
<p>The innovative tender mechanism is intended to leave the conventional relationships between client, banks and institutions intact but adds a new dimension to deals and addresses some of the concerns of British regulators.</p>
<p>Prior to this the only means for companies seeking to raise funds to set the balance of risk and reward for investors had been through the price level at which it offered its shares.  </p>
<p>With a tender, proponents say, companies are able to try varying the fees with which they reward those prepared to protect their whole transaction from the risk of failure -- specifically the sub-underwriters. British biotechnology company Biocompatibles International Plc also launched a rights issue in November including a sub-underwriting tender conducted by Merrill Lynch and Kleinwort Benson.</p>
