BT hails Japan move to make NTT international.

LONDON 1996-12-06

British Telecoms (BT), which has been longing to get a foothold in Asia, on Friday welcomed news the Japanese government was allowing Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) to offer international services.

"BT...welcomes the news that NTT is to be given the opportunity to operate on a truly international basis," a company spokesman said in an interview.

"NTT, with a global service capability, can only be good Japanese customers and the Japanese economy."  

But he would not say whether news that Japan will restructure NTT into three companies -- two regional and one long-distance group under one holding company -- would help BT in its quest to link up with the Japanese telecoms giant.

"We've always said we'd like NTT to be our partner in Japan. We can't say whether this makes it easier and better, but we welcome that they will be able to compete internationally," he said.

BT, which argues that effective regulation can ensure competition, has suggested that NTT should not be broken up into separate, competing companies.

The British telecoms giant, which last month announced a $20 billion merger with U.S. international carrier MCI -- partly to make the enlarged group a more attractive partner for its Asian expansion plans -- has had a technology agreement with NTT for 10 years.

Japan's Posts ministry said earlier today that the NTT restructuring may not be put into place until 1999-2000.
