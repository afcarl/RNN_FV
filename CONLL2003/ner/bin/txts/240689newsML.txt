Brazil's BNDES to launch 300 bln lire bond in 1997.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Brazil's National Development Bank (BNDES) will issue a 300 billion lire five-year bond early next year, a syndicate manager at joint lead manager Paribas Capital Markets said on Friday.

"BNDES will issue the bond next year," he told Reuters, adding that no exact date had been set. Other bankers said the deal was likely in January. Credito Italiano and Merrill Lynch are the other joint lead managers on the deal.

Latin American borrowers have been active in the lire sector, with Argentina raising 600 billion lire in the 10-year sector on Thursday.

Last week Argentina's YPF launched a 300 billion lire five-year deal which paid an 8.75 percent coupon. Other credits seen this year include Mexico, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) and Telecommmunicacoes Brasileiras - Telebras.
