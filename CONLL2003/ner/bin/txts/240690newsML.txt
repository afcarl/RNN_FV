GUS falls after results prompt downgrades.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Shares in British retail and mail order group Great Universal Stores Plc fell a further 23-1/2p on Friday, on the back of Thursday's fall in profits and subsequent earnings downgrades of current year forecasts.

GUS shares were trading at 628-1/2p by 1058 GMT, down 23p on on the day. After falling 3.53 percent, the stock was the biggest loser in the FTSE 100 index.

BZW downgraded profit forecasts for the group to 555 million stg from 585 million stg in 1997 after the group announced a disappointing set of results.  

BZW had already downgraded estimates prior to the results.

Traders said they expected other analysts to follow suit.

Pretax profits dropped to 235.6 million stg from 237.5 million stg in the six months to September. Profit for the period was roughly in line with analysts expectations of between 232-235 million stg.

It was the first time in 48 years that profits had fallen.
