Hay & Robertson and Gullit in clothes deal.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Dutch soccer star Ruud Gullit is to have a range of casual clothing named after him under a five-year deal with UK sports and leisurewear firm Hay & Robertson, the company said on Friday.

Gullit, player-manager of Chelsea, will be paid an initial six-figure sum and also receive a royalty on worldwide sales of the items. The company plans to produce a wide range of leisure clothing from tops to underwear which it will market under the "Ruud" label of its Admiral brand.

"We're delighted that we have attracted such a high profile figure," said Hay & Robertson chief executive Lance Yates.  

"He's stylish, a great role model and very eloquent. We've had a succession of development meetings and he's had a lot of input and will work with us on developing the range," he added.

Yates said he believed the clothing would appeal to everyone from teenagers to 40-year-olds.

The dreadlocked Gullit has been one of the most popular and successful players in world soccer over the past decade in a career which has taken him from his native Netherlands to Italy and then on to England.

Hay & Robertson recently paid 150,000 stg to acquire the European licensing rights to the Admiral brand.  

It is seeking to relaunch Admiral, which dominated the British soccer kit market in the 1970s, but now supplies only a handful of lower division clubs.
