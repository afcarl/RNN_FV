<p>Dutch soccer star Ruud Gullit is to have a range of casual clothing named after him under a five-year deal with UK sports and leisurewear firm Hay &amp; Robertson, the company said on Friday.</p>
<p>Gullit, player-manager of Chelsea, will be paid an initial six-figure sum and also receive a royalty on worldwide sales of the items. The company plans to produce a wide range of leisure clothing from tops to underwear which it will market under the &quot;Ruud&quot; label of its Admiral brand.</p>
<p>&quot;We're delighted that we have attracted such a high profile figure,&quot; said Hay &amp; Robertson chief executive Lance Yates.  </p>
<p>&quot;He's stylish, a great role model and very eloquent. We've had a succession of development meetings and he's had a lot of input and will work with us on developing the range,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Yates said he believed the clothing would appeal to everyone from teenagers to 40-year-olds.</p>
<p>The dreadlocked Gullit has been one of the most popular and successful players in world soccer over the past decade in a career which has taken him from his native Netherlands to Italy and then on to England.</p>
<p>Hay &amp; Robertson recently paid 150,000 stg to acquire the European licensing rights to the Admiral brand.  </p>
<p>It is seeking to relaunch Admiral, which dominated the British soccer kit market in the 1970s, but now supplies only a handful of lower division clubs.</p>
