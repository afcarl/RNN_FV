FEATURE - Wine prices ride crest of global economic wave.

The strong global economy and low interest rates which have driven up share prices around the world this year have also brought a rich harvest for London's wine auctioneers.

As champagne corks fly in financial institutions celebrating large profits and hefty bonuses, the capital's auction houses have been enjoying a rich, full-bodied recovery in the demand for premier wine.

Most investors are buying to lay down a cellar for their future enjoyment. But many are using money from speculation to gamble again on the little-known "en primeur", or futures, market where a top bottle of wine can earn huge profits.

"It's quite noticeable. A year ago I thought prices had probably stabilised for a while, but I've been proved wrong," said Paul Bowker, head of wines at auctioneers Christies.

"There's no doubt we've seen a big pick-up in demand from the City (London's financial district). People have bigger bonuses and want places to invest."

Bonuses paid by London Stock Exchange member firms to their employees soared by nearly 50 percent over the past year to a record 315 million pounds ($530 million).

Serena Sutcliffe, head of the wine department at auction house Sotheby's, said demand for top quality wines has been "insatiable" over the past six months.

Large bonuses have helped but low interest rates have also made wine an attractive investment, she said.

"Blue-chip wines have been walking out of the door," Sutcliffe said. "It's been a meteoric year for top wine prices but it might be stabilising now."

BRITAIN AT THE FOREFRONT

Although the majority of fine wines that come under the hammer are French, the centre of the world's wine auction market is actually London. The British have been at the forefront of the wine market for well over 800 hundred years.

Bordeaux, where the majority of the world's most expensive and arguably finest wines are produced, became English in 1154 as part of the dowry for Eleanor of Aquitaine.

Eleanor married King Henry II and during the next 300 years of English rule, a thriving commerce developed with English merchants. By the time Bordeaux was reunited with France in 1453 a lucrative wine trade had developed with England, which has survived to this day.

Wine, like other more traditional commodities, has a futures market as well as the traditional open outcry or auction format.

Investors can speculate by purchasing wine, usually top-quality red Bordeaux, known as claret, only six months after the grapes have been harvested.

Speculators have made huge profits in this market by snapping up rights to buy claret long before the wine is in the shops and well before the professional trade press have given their collective verdict on its quality.

Just as an individual share price can rocket if a top investment analyst rates it a "buy", wine prices can also soar if an influential writer gives a particular claret a rave review.

Top wines for grapes picked in 1996 for example will not usually be released for public sale until the year 1999, as winemakers let the claret mature in wooden vats.

A person investing in a Chateau Mouton Rothschild 1995 red wine futures contract in May 1995 would have seen his investment grow by 30 percent within 12 months, compared with a 15 percent rise for London's FTSE 100 share index during the same period.

An even more staggering gain was realised by a few canny investors who bought a 12-bottle case of Chateau Le Pin in 1994 for 3,000 pounds at auction.

Last month a case of Le Pin was sold for 22,000 pounds -- a sevenfold increase in just two years.

DETERMINING CRITERIA

But who determines what is a top wine? The French government laid the groundwork in 1855 by introducing a classification system which separated a few elite wines of the time from the "vin ordinaire".

Today 20 to 30 of the top or "cru classe" Bordeaux wines account for 75 percent of the wine auction market, but those select few wineries cannot rely on historical tradition alone.

They still must produce wines of superior flavour, colour, and body, according to Bowker.

The dramatic rise in the price of Le Pin is a case in point. The winery was only founded in the late 1970's but critics have given it glowing reviews over the past few years.

Not all Bordeaux wines have realised such dramatic returns, but since 1980 the region's top quality wines have appreciated by an average of 10 to 15 percent per annum.

Like any market the value of wine can go down as well as up. Christies noted that speculators made little if any gains buying wine for red Bordeaux vintages of the years 1991 to 1994.

"Those were not particularly good vintages and the global recession also played a part in depressing prices," Bowker said.

But wine prices never collapsed. They merely stabilised, helped by growing demand from new wine-lovers in the Far East.

Bowker said executives in booming economies from countries like Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, and Taiwan were snapping up top wines from the best vintages in the 1980s, which helped keep a floor on the poorer years.

"Demand for the top wines still outstrips supply," he said. ($1=.5937 Pound)
