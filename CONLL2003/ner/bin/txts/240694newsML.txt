Greenspan sends skittish Bradys into sharp reverse.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Emerging debt prices slumped on Friday morning, dragged down by the dive in U.S. Treasuries after comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, traders said.

Greenspan, speaking at a dinner in Washington, said the Fed had to beware of "irrational exuberence" infecting financial markets which could end up damaging the economy.

Brady bond prices fell across the board, in some case by more than a point.

"The market looks very ugly this morning. There's been a little bit of client selling," a U.S. bank trader said.

Argentine FRBs were bid a point lower at 85-3/4 cents in the dollar. Brazil C bonds also dipped a point to a bid of 72-3/8.

East European prices were also sharply lower, including Bulgaria which in the past two days has been buoyed by hopes of imminent help for its ailing economy from the International Monetary Fund.

Greenspan's comments hit a market that was already holding its breath for the U.S. payroll data for November due at 1330 GMT.

However, traders said the selling was not a fresh purge of the market which had recovered from heavy profit-taking in early October.

"It might be a good thing. The cheap prices should bring back some buyers. I'd rather it (the fall) happened now than in January," one said.

The direction of U.S. Treasuries is completely overwhelming Bradys for the moment and traders said that until this afternoon's payroll data, the market is largely ignoring individual country news.
