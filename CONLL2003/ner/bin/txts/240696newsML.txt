U.S. refining margin hits 17-month high - IEA.

LONDON 1996-12-06

U.S. Gulf complex refining margins hit a 17-month high in November and profits in the other principal refining centres also saw a welcome boost, according to the International Energy Agency in its end-November report published on Friday.

U.S. Gulf cracking margins based on WTI crude gained 97 cents to $1.62 per barrel last month, the highest level for 17 months, "supported by the rise in gasoline prices relative to those of crude," the IEA said.

In Rotterdam, cracking margins for Brent crude in northern Europe climbed even more sharply, by $1.23 to $2.38 per barrel. "Rotterdam margins were supported by the increases in naphtha and LSFO prices relative to crude," the report said.

Mediterranean margins increased by less than those in northern Europe because sour crude prices strengthened versus Brent. Cracking margins based on Urals crude rose by 42 cents to $2.47 per barrel.

The Singapore cracking margin based on Dubai crude saw the biggest rise of all, up $1.32 to $3.34 per barrel. The IEA said: "The upward pressure on margins was particularly evident in the rise in gas oil/crude and gasoline/crude spreads."
