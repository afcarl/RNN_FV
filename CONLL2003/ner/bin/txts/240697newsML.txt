World refining capacity to rise 1 mbpd in '97--IEA.

LONDON 1996-12-06

World refining capacity is expected to rise nearly 1.0 million barrels per day (bpd), or 1.1 percent, in 1997, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday.

In its end-November monthly oil market report, the Paris-based IEA said global refining capacity grew 1.7 million bpd in 1996 with Asia providing three-quarters of the gains.

The IEA did not provide overall figures on world refining capacity but the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 1996 said world refining capacity was 76.4 million bpd in 1995.

In Asia alone, refining capacity rose 1.27 million bpd in 1996, more than offsetting regional demand growth of 650,000 bpd, the IEA said.

As a result, refining margins in the Asian refining centre Singapore fell in the third quarter, the agency said.

"(There was) increasing supply pressure on, in particular, gasoline in Asia," the IEA said.

In the Americas, refining capacity will rise 373,000 bpd in 1996 while in the rest of the world capacity will rise just 45,000 bpd because of expansions in Cyprus and Morocco.

Though the refining growth will slow down in 1997, the IEA said, both 1996 and 1997 forecasts do not include "refinery creep", the small capacity additions because of better information and refining technology and improved refinery operations.

Refinery creep is estimated to increase overall capacity by an average 300,000-500,000 bpd every year, the agency said.
