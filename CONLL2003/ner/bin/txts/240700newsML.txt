UK output data confirm manufacturing upswing.

October UK industrial production and manufacturing output data confirm the steady recovery in manufacturing but are unlikely to have a major impact on monetary policy, economists said on Friday.

"The data confirm evidence that a pick-up in the manufacturing sector has taken place and will continue as we look ahead," Deutsche Morgan Grenfell economist Ciaran Barr said.

"But this doesn't change the picture for interest rates. Rates will go up next year anyway."  

October manufacturing output rose 0.5 percent, both month-on-month and year-on-year, slightly faster than the Reuters consensus forecast of 0.5 percent.

Industrial output, however, was flat on the month and grew 1.3 percent year-on-year, below the 1.6 percent consensus.

"We shouldn't be concerned at all over the headline figure because it is all weather-related," Barr said. "It will rebound in November, which was quite cold."

Richard Jeffrey of Charterhouse Tilney Securities Ltd said the official figures underestimated the strength of the economic recovery.  

"The point is that, overall, the government's official series underestimates manufacturing output, a conclusion supported by the PMI figures," Jeffrey said.

The PMI index dipped to 54.4 percen in November from October's 54.5, reflecting an expansion in the manufacturing sector for the sixth consecutive month.

"Manufacturing output is much in line with market expectations. I would expect significant revisions by half to one percent in the figures for the year," Jeffrey said.  

Robust consumer demand would force the government to raise interest rates next year, after it had gauged the strength of Christmas consumer spending, he added.

Bank of England Governor Eddie George on Thursday said there was no urgent need for a dramatic base rate increase, but short sterling futures still point to a rise of around 60 basis points from the present 6.0 percent by the end of March..

CIBC Wood Gundy economist David Coleman said the data painted a bright picture of the manufacturing sector.

"There are signs that the pick-up in consumer spending is finally starting to be reflected in higher output," he said.  

"The pound's appreciation is one dark spot on the horizon, but a strong domestic economy should at least help cushion the impact."

Jonathan Loynes of HSBC Markets said the data pointed to tentative recovery, but warned that the government could not afford to take a strong economic revival for granted.

"The pick-up is only fragile and a further rise in interest rates -- renewing the pound's appreciation -- could threaten to tip manufacturing back towards recession," he said.

Jeremy Hawkins of Bank of America said economic growth was strong enough to maintain pressure for a January rate rise.  

"They do support the view that the inventory overhang that hit growth earlier in the year has now been largely addressed," he said.

"The rise in sterling does not appear to have had a big effect, although subsequent gains in November may yet take the edge off future production."
