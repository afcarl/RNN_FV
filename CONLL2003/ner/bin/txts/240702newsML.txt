BTR rallies to show only gain in FTSE.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Shares in Anglo-Australian diversified manufacturing company BTR Plc rallied in early trading and the stock was the only net gainer in the FTSE 100 index by 1015 GMT.

BTR shares were 2-1/2p firmer at 233p in a market which saw the FTSE 100 index down around 75 points.

Dealers said the BTR shares had been dragged lower by the very weak market in early trading but gained strength from a positive trading statement.

BTR said it expects its second half performance to be an improvement over the first six months although it also expects exchange rates to have some adverse impact in the second half.

In the first half, BTR reported a sharp drop in pre-tax profits and slashed its dividend payout by 28 percent. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717.
