<title>UK: S&amp;P rates Landsbanki Islands sub FRN A plus.</title>
<headline>S&amp;P rates Landsbanki Islands sub FRN A plus.</headline>

<p>Standard and Poor's said on Friday it assigned its A plus rating to Iceland's Landsbanki Islands $30 million, 15-year subordinated floating rate note and the outlook was stable.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P said in a statement the rating was based on the strong support of the goverenment of Iceland and thus equalled the republic's long-term foreign currency sovereign rating.</p>
<p>All of Landsbanki's obligations, including the FRN being rated, were irrevocably guaranteed under statute by the government, the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The rating also reflects Landsbanki's economic and political importance as the largest commercial bank in the country and its prominent market position, with about 40 percent of total financial system deposits and about 20 percent of total system credit,&quot; S&amp;P said.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P said about six percent of Landsbanki's loan portfolio was non-performing as of the third quarter of 1996. Provisioning against non-performing loans was adequate according to Icelandic loan classification standards, it added.</p>
<p>Asset growth had remained stagnant since 1990 due to dire economic conditions in Iceland in the early 1990s and to the bank's will to maintain adequate capitalisation levels.</p>
<p>As of September 1996, equity capital represented 9.1 percent of risk-adjusted assets.</p>
<p>Landsbanki's profitability ratios had improved steadily since the banking crisis of 1991 in Iceland, but remained at relatively low levels, with net income over average assets expected to reach 0.3 percent in 1996, up from 0.17 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said the stable outlook reflected the rating agency's expectations that the government of Iceland would continue to extend its support to Landsbanki over the life of the rated security.</p>
<p>&quot;It also balances Iceland's improved macroeconomic management with the country's still high net public external debt burden, at 96 percent of exports in 1996,&quot; the statement said.</p>
