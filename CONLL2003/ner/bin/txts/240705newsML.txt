Hanson lower despite price complaint.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Currently demerging Hanson Plc shares were lower on Friday despite founder Lord Hanson's statement on Thursday that the company's market capitalisation does not reflect its earning capacity or prospects.

Hanson shares were 2-1/2p lower at 77-1/2, underperforming a weak market.

Analysts said doubts remained over the prospects for Hanson's energy business, to be demerged in February and over its building materials group.

They said the market is awaiting further information on the continuing demerger process. Hanson published the listing document for its energy business next week. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717.
