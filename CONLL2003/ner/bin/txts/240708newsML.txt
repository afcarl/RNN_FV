Nov world oil supply up 1.3 mbpd to 73.9 mbpd - IEA.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Big jumps in crude oil production from the North Sea and Latin America were behind a rise of 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in world supplies during November, said the International Energy Agency (IEA), the West's oil watchdog.

Production climbed to 73.9 million bpd, up from a revised figure of 72.6 million bpd in October, the IEA said in its latest Monthly Oil Market Report on Friday.

Once more the gain in non-OPEC supply far outpaced the OPEC increase in November, the IEA said.

Rises in supply reflected seasonal output increases in the northern hemisphere due to lower field maintenance as well as new fields in the North Sea, U.S. Gulf, Brazil and West Africa.

Almost 95 percent of the monthly increase of 1.3 million bpd occurred in non-OPEC countries with the North Sea and Latin America accounting for about three quarters of this non-OPEC rise.

An absence of maintenance and increased production from two new Norwegian fields and twelve new U.K. fields is estimated to have led to increases of 372,000 bpd and 337,000 bpd respectively in the two sectors.

Brazilian offshore output and the recovery of Mexican crude and natural gas liquids output were responsible for most of the 150,000 bpd rise in Latin American production.

Mexican production had been hit by an explosion last summer at the Cactus gas processing plant.

The surge in non-OPEC output during November supports the view that during the whole of the fourth quarter non-OPEC supply will rise 1.7 million bpd from third quarter levels.

The IEA said that an improved outlook for many offshore fields next year suggest that non-OPEC supply growth in 1997 will at the high end of the range 1.5 to 2.0 million bpd.

This compares with projected world demand growth of 1.9 million bpd in 1997

In the North Sea production saw a defintive upward movement in November from both the U.K. and Norwegian sectors.

Total north Sea oil production is estimated to have been 6.98 million bpd for the month and an additional 350,000 bpd is expected in December.  

Preliminary estimates of November U.K. production show a 330,000 bpd rise. The largest rise of about 95,000 bpd is believed to have occurred in the Forties system while the Brent Charlie platform was brought back towards a targeted 80,000 bpd by the end of the year.

In December U.K. production is due to gain 220,000 bpd to a total of 3.0 million bpd.

In Norway production rose 372,000 bpd to 3.55 million bpd in November. The main reason for the rise was the return of the Gullfaks system which helped the Gullfaks-Statfjord area increase production by 288,000 bpd.

Mexican production in November rose by 105,000 bpd with crude up 30,000 bpd and natural gas liquids up by about 75,000 bpd.

Crude oil production is benefiting from an on-going project to de-bottleneck the major Campeche processing facility. Weather permitting December Mexican crude oil production could exceed 3.0 million bpd and NGL output could may reach 490,000 bpd.

Brazil is in the midst of a major production expansion of the Campos Bains Albacora and Marlim fields.

Petrobras announced a new daily oil production record of 900,000 bpd in early November.
