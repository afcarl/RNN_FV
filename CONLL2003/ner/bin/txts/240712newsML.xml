<p>Following is a selection of economists' reactions to UK data showing industrial production unchanged month-on-month in October and manufacturing output up 0.5 percent month/month:</p>
<p>GLENN DAVIES, CREDIT LYONNAIS</p>
<p>&quot;I am surprised by the industrial production figure. But the market is going to be focussing on the manufaturing output number. That was somewhat stronger than expected, indicating that the pickup we have seen in much of the domestic economy is now starting to come through and boost manufaturing output.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;The question still remains just how strong consumer spending will be next year and will the strength of consumer spending spill over into inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>NICK STAMENKOVIC, DKB INTERNATIONAL (RFTV)</p>
<p>&quot;Manufacturing output is the encouraging aspect of these figures. It clearly suggests that the upward trend now is intact.&quot;  </p>
<p>PHILIP SHAW, UNION DISCOUNT</p>
<p>&quot;The important part of the report is the rise in manufacturing output. This indicates the manufacturing sector has well and truly shruggged off the story of its weakness early this year and stronger domestic demand is feeding through. Mild weather conditions have led to a decrease in utilities output and a fall in oil production has led to this measure being unchanged on the month. It certainly suggests that economic growth is quickening and I would expect GDP to have remained above the trend in the fourth quarter.&quot;  </p>
<p>JEREMY HAWKINS, BANK OF AMERICA</p>
<p>&quot;Manufacturing output rose 0.5 percent. This is towards the upper end of the range and bodes well for an acceleration in Q4 GDP. Overall industrial production was flat, however, but was biased down by the usual erratic swings in the energy sector. Data are unlikely to have much of an impact upon markets which are more focussed on U.S. developments, but they do support the view that the inventory overhang that hit growth earlier in the year has now been largely addressed. Rise in stg does not appear to have had a big effect, although subsequent gains in November may yet take the edge off future production.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Nonetheless, overall picture is bright enough and UK outperformance versus most of the EU seems assured next year. Should leave the pound in good shape irrespective of the gains to date and should sustain pressure for higher base rates.&quot;</p>
