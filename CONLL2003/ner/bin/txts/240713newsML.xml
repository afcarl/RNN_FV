<p>Two people were killed when an executive jet en route to Ireland from Michigan crashed on approach to an airport in Stephenville, Newfoundland, on Friday, authorities said.</p>
<p>The pilot and co-pilot, the only two aboard, were killed in the crash of the Learjet 36, airport manager David Snow said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Snow said the plane last reported to air traffic control at about 3 A.M. local time/1:30 A.M. EST (0630 GMT) when it began its final approach about 10 miles (16 km) from the airport in this east coast Canadian province.</p>
<p>That was the last communication the aircraft made with the airport, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We considered it as being missing until about 0600 (4:30 A.M. EST) (0930 GMT). That's when the wreckage was discovered,&quot; Snow said.</p>
<p>He said the cargo flight originated in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and was due to stop at Stephenville for refueling before going to Shannon, Ireland.</p>
<p>The cause of the crash was not yet known. Investigators were due to fly to Stephenville later on Friday.</p>
