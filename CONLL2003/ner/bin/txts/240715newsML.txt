Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rasheed said on Friday he expected Iraqi oil exports under a U.N. oil-for-food deal would resume early next Tuesday for the first time in more than six years.

"We expect the (U.N.) secretary-general to present his final report, maximum next Monday. This means we have the right to start (exports) on the first minute after Monday midnight New York time (0500 GMT Tuesday)," Rasheed said in an interview on Iraqi state television.

He said Iraq would start as soon as it received approval to fill storage tanks at the Turkish terminal of Ceyhan. Rasheed said Iraqi exports would not exceed 650,000 barrels per day at current prices.

Iraq last month accepted U.N. conditions for oil exports worth $2 billion every six months to enable it to buy food and medicine for its sanctions-hit civilian population. The deal is renewable.

The limited exports, tightly supervised by the United Nations, will be Iraq's first since a ban on Iraqi oil exports was imposed following Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

Rasheed said foreign firms were lining up to buy Iraqi oil. "Contracts are ready and complete and the United Nations has agreed to them. We are not going to discuss the contracts. They are ready," he said.

He said the United Nation's sanctions committee had accepted Baghdad's pricing formula last month, along with arrangements for letters of credit neeeded for shipping of oil and the flow of humanitarian goods into Iraq.

An Iraqi oil official said on Thursday representives from France's Elf Aquitaine and Japan's Mitsubishi were among the first to finalise deals to buy Iraqi crude.

"Not only Elf and Mitsubishi, which could be the first to load Iraqi crude. There are many other firms in Baghdad," the official said.

Rasheed said Iraq planned to celebrate the start of exports after the six-year blockade with events at both its northern oil city of Kirkuk and the southern oilfield of Rumailah.

A team from Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence left Baghdad on Tuesday after inspecting Iraq's trade outlets to pave the way for U.N. inspection of humanitarian supplies reaching Iraq under the oil deal.

Rasheed said U.N. experts from the Dutch Saybolt firm found metering equipment on Iraqi-Turkish pipeline in good order and reported the finding to the U.N. secretary-general.

He said Iraq pumped oil through the twin pipeline for six hours on Thursday to let the experts inspect the gauging gear at Zakho pumping station close to the border with Turkey.

Turkey's Energy Ministry said in a statement that after the test "the continuous dispatch of oil under U.N. supervision is expected to begin within a week at the latest."

The Turkish part of the 986-km (616-mile) twin pipeline from Iraq's Kirkuk oilfields to Ceyhan is ready to work at full capacity, the statement said. Under the U.N. terms, most Iraqi oil exports must go via Turkey.

The pipeline has been idle since the invasion of Kuwait and there are about 12 million barrels of oil inside it, 7.5 million of that in Turkish territory.
