<headline>PLO says Arafat, Netanyahu could meet Saturday.</headline>

<p>PLO negotiators said on Friday Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak might all meet on Saturday to try to clinch a deal on Israel's handover of Hebron to the PLO.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very possible that Arafat and Netanyahu will meet in Cairo on Saturday. There is work on arranging such a meeting hosted by President Mubarak,&quot; one PLO official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Israeli officials said no meeting had yet been set.</p>
<p>Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu Rdainah said:</p>
<p>&quot;President Arafat is ready to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu but no time or date has been set for such a meeting yet.</p>
<p>&quot;President Arafat's position is clear that such a meeting should come after successful negotiations so that the meeting would have positive results. Especially since the Hebron issue has not been agreed yet and the crucial disputed issues have not been resolved.&quot;</p>
<p>But Rdainah said Arafat would go to Cairo on Saturday for talks with Mubarak.</p>
<p>Both Arafat and Netanyahu have expressed willingness to meet. They last met in Washington after clashes in September that killed 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis. The violence was spurred by Israel's opening an entrance to a tunnel near Moslem sites in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) negotiators said the last two weeks of talks with Israel on implementing the long-delayed handover of most of Hebron to PLO rule had been &quot;meaningless&quot;, necessitating an Arafat-Netanyahu meeting.</p>
<p>Mubarak's adviser Osama el-Baz said on Thursday there were efforts to arrange a meeting between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Palestinian Authority Secretary General Ahmed Abdel-Rahman said on Thursday he understood it could be held in Cairo either on Friday or Sunday.</p>
<p>Abdel-Rahman had said on Thursday he did not think Saturday would be the date because it is the Jewish sabbath. But the Jewish sabbath ends at sundown, so a night meeting would not interfere with the religious observance.</p>
