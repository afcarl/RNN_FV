Gulf Arab leaders meet on Saturday to tackle obstacles blocking real economic integration but Bahrain has already declared it is boycotting the summit over a border dispute and a spy row with hosts Qatar (corrects to add reference to border dispute).

Bahrain put two Qataris, a man and a woman, on trial this week on charges of spying.

Efforts to persuade Bahrain to reverse its boycott decision were dealt a blow on Friday when Qatar accused Bahrain of torturing the accused Qatari man, Hamad al-Baker, to extract a confession.

Qatar, locked in a border dispute with Bahrain since the 1930s, has denied the spying charge.

No state has boycotted a GCC summit since the formation of the Gulf Cooperation Council in 1981 by OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and small oil producers Oman and Bahrain.

This year's host, Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, who removed his father from power last year, boycotted last year's GCC closing session in Oman to protest against the method used to appoint a new GCC secretary general.

Delegates to the three-day summit in the Qatari capital Doha said a lack of full cooperation between state institutions in a region dominated by personal ties had blocked economic integration among the six GCC states.

Unification of customs duties is needed to forge a free trade accord with the European Union that could open lucrative markets to cheap petrochemicals from the GCC.

GCC delegates and diplomats said the group was unlikely to move on several key and long-awaited integration measures.

"The GCC is not dead but you might see stagnation over the next few months. There are also still some differences on the customs tariffs," said a delegate.

Ties between GCC states "are not built on institutions. They are personal ties between leaders," said a senior delegate to the summit.

"There are always up and downs when ties are built on people and now we are in the down cycle," said the delegate of clear differences which became public with Sheikh Hamad's boycott (corrects from walkout).

His move angered many at the time but Sheikh Hamad has managed recently to remove his state from a collision course with some GCC members, especially dominant power Saudi Arabia.

"Our ties now with Saudi Arabia are excellent and the relationship with Kuwait is built on understanding and objectivity...The only problem is with Bahrain which is mixing issues," said a Qatari analyst.

The GCC states, which control almost half of the world's oil reserves, have failed to meet a target of ending their border disputes by last December.

Security issues are also likely to be on the summit agenda. All six countries, realising Islamic fundamentalism could grow and find fertile ground in their conservative states, have pledged to fight "extremism" and "terrorism". But a joint security pact still faces difficulties despite years of talks.

UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan, 78, is unlikely to attend the summit because of recent surgery. Saudi Arabia's 75-year-old King Fahd, who suffered a stroke last year, is also expected to send a deputy.
