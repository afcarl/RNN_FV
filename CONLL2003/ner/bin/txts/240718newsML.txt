Turk students face 18 years in jail for protest.

ANKARA 1996-12-06

A Turkish security court on Friday sentenced students who led demonstrations against higher education fees to up to 18 years in prison, lawyers and a human rights group said.

The courtroom erupted in protest after four students received prison terms of 18 years, and four more received terms between three and 12 years, the Humans Rights Association said in a joint statement with the Contemporary Lawyers Association (CHD).

Nine other students facing similar charges of membership in an illegal group, named by the court as the 'revolutionary youth organisation', were acquitted.

Head of the CHD, Senal Sarihan, told Reuters the main reason for the verdicts was a demonstration in central Ankara in March. Students took over some university buildings during protests against a rise in student fees.

"There was an illegal demonstration on March 30 at which petrol bombs were thrown. The kids were alleged to have taken part. That's the only real evidence there was," she said.

Family and friends of the students started shouting slogans after the verdict, Sarihan said. Police waded in with batons, hitting spectators.

A leftist woman ex-MP, Fatma Feriha Ozturk, was beaten on the head and dragged down stairs outside the courtroom. She was taken to hospital with a broken leg, the rights group said.
