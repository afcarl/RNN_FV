<p>A Turkish security court on Friday sentenced students who led demonstrations against higher education fees to up to 18 years in prison, lawyers and a human rights group said.</p>
<p>The courtroom erupted in protest after four students received prison terms of 18 years, and four more received terms between three and 12 years, the Humans Rights Association said in a joint statement with the Contemporary Lawyers Association (CHD).</p>
<p>Nine other students facing similar charges of membership in an illegal group, named by the court as the 'revolutionary youth organisation', were acquitted.</p>
<p>Head of the CHD, Senal Sarihan, told Reuters the main reason for the verdicts was a demonstration in central Ankara in March. Students took over some university buildings during protests against a rise in student fees.</p>
<p>&quot;There was an illegal demonstration on March 30 at which petrol bombs were thrown. The kids were alleged to have taken part. That's the only real evidence there was,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Family and friends of the students started shouting slogans after the verdict, Sarihan said. Police waded in with batons, hitting spectators.</p>
<p>A leftist woman ex-MP, Fatma Feriha Ozturk, was beaten on the head and dragged down stairs outside the courtroom. She was taken to hospital with a broken leg, the rights group said.</p>
