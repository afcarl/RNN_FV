Turkey's Erbakan silent on coalition rift reports.

ANKARA 1996-12-06

Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan refused comment on Friday about media reports his coalition partners had defied him by suspending one of Turkey's top policemen in a security scandal.

"We will speak when the time is right," Anatolian news agency quoted Erbakan as saying when asked if he had told his True Path Party (DYP) government ally to suspend Istanbul police chief Kemal Yazicioglu.

Erbakan later went into a meeting of his Islam-based Welfare Party leadership without talking to waiting reporters.

The Turkish media and opposition has said Interior Minister Meral Aksener, a DYP deputy, suspended Yazicioglu on Thursday either without Erbakan's knowledge or against his will.

The media said Yazicioglu was punished for leaking to opposition leader Mesut Yilmaz information on the scandal damaging to the DYP.

"This action was carried out without the prime minister's knowledge," Yilmaz told a meeting of his conservative Motherland Party (ANAP).

Yilmaz has said he has a video of three policemen, who act as bodyguards to a DYP deputy, confessing to killing a casino owner in July in a money-laundering feud. The three were also suspended on Thursday.

The DYP deputy, Sedat Bucak, is at the centre of allegations Turkey gets far-right gangsters to carry out political killings in return for ignoring their heroin smuggling and money laundering.
