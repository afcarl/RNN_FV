<headline>Turkey's Erbakan silent on coalition rift reports.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan refused comment on Friday about media reports his coalition partners had defied him by suspending one of Turkey's top policemen in a security scandal.</p>
<p>&quot;We will speak when the time is right,&quot; Anatolian news agency quoted Erbakan as saying when asked if he had told his True Path Party (DYP) government ally to suspend Istanbul police chief Kemal Yazicioglu.</p>
<p>Erbakan later went into a meeting of his Islam-based Welfare Party leadership without talking to waiting reporters.</p>
<p>The Turkish media and opposition has said Interior Minister Meral Aksener, a DYP deputy, suspended Yazicioglu on Thursday either without Erbakan's knowledge or against his will.</p>
<p>The media said Yazicioglu was punished for leaking to opposition leader Mesut Yilmaz information on the scandal damaging to the DYP.</p>
<p>&quot;This action was carried out without the prime minister's knowledge,&quot; Yilmaz told a meeting of his conservative Motherland Party (ANAP).</p>
<p>Yilmaz has said he has a video of three policemen, who act as bodyguards to a DYP deputy, confessing to killing a casino owner in July in a money-laundering feud. The three were also suspended on Thursday.</p>
<p>The DYP deputy, Sedat Bucak, is at the centre of allegations Turkey gets far-right gangsters to carry out political killings in return for ignoring their heroin smuggling and money laundering.</p>
