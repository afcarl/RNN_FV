Mideast expects no big changes with Albright.

Palestinians and Israelis say they do not expect Madeleine Albright to change the course of U.S. policy on the Middle East.

But some fear U.S. peace diplomacy could slow to a snail's pace under the newly nominated secretary of state.

President Bill Clinton on Thursday nominated his outspoken United Nations representative to succeed Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who plans to retire from politics when the new administration is sworn in. Congress is expected to approve Albright's nomination.

"Our experience is that U.S. policy on the Middle East is very little affected by the change of people," said Ghassan al-Khatib, a former Palestinian negotiator who now heads a press and research centre in Jerusalem.

"On the other hand, the degree of commitment by one official or another can determine how active the U.S. role will be," Khatib said.

Mark Heller, of Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Centre for Strategic Studies, said: "I don't think that there is much in her personal history or background that would suggest a radical change."

"It is more a question of the broader priority of the administration as a whole," he said.

The United States played a key role in nudging Israelis and Arabs to the negotiation table in 1991 and stepped in when negotiations hit a snag.

President Clinton hosted the signing of two self-rule deals between Israel and the PLO in Washington and presided over the signing of the 1994 Israeli-Jordanian peace agreement.

Christopher made more than 20 shuttle missions to the Middle East either to end tensions between Israel and Syria and Lebanon or to try to bridge gaps in negotiations.

"There is no reason to assume that she will be personally as committed as Secretary Christopher was in terms of initiating things," Heller said.

"Sometimes, the region and the realities of the region impose themselves on the U.S. government.

"If things manage to limp along in the area without a major outbreak, I don't think there is any reason to expect vigorous U.S. involvement," he said.

Albright's east European origins and her experience at the United Nations give her a broad perspective on world affairs.

Experts say that the 59-year-old daughter of a Czech diplomat who railed against totalitarianism would try to further U.S. involvement in world affairs as a whole.

"Albright has east European roots and thus may tend to give more attention to eastern Europe," said Ali al-Jirbawi, a political science professor at the West Bank's Bir Zeit University.

"I think that unless there was something to warrant U.S. intervention, Washington would try to keep the status quo," he said.

Heller believes that the United States is likely to continue to play an active role on Israeli-PLO negotiations on implementing a self-rule deal signed by the previous Israeli government. But he did not see Albright putting much effort towards brokering an Israeli-Syrian agreement.

"I believe there will be less active involvement on the Syrian-Israeli track. I don't see Secretary Albright travelling to Damascus 20 times as Christopher did," Heller said.

"If Netanyahu is to feel any pressure at all it would be on the Palestinian track," he said.

"I don't think that the U.S. government would come and try to apply pressure on Israel to make concessions. But the administration would make it known that it is interested in continuing the peace process."
