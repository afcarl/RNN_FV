ISTANBUL 1996-12-06

Turkish central bank governor Gazi Ercel said on Friday the bank's 1997 monetary programme contained no changes from the current policy of stressing control over reserve money and exchange rate stability.

"The basic logic behind the (1997) programme is the control of reserve money and supervision of exchange rates as in the 1996 programme," Ercel told a seminar on 1997 monetary policy.

He said the bank's policy of controlling exchange rates and not interferring with interest rates in line with the monetary indicators would continue.

"When we see extreme fluctuations or movements, we will analyse them and act with the instruments available to use for stability," Ercel said.

He said the programme foresaw a yearly inflation rate at 70 percent in the first half of next year, compared to a current wholesale inflation of 85.7 percent.

Ercel added that expected progress in privatisation and tax revenues could lower the inflation rate to below 70 percent in the second half of 1997.

He said monetary developments in 1997 would depend on relations with the International Monetary Fund, the speed of privatisation, the Treasury's possibilities to borrow in international markets and a surplus in the budget's non-interest balance.
