Turkey's unemployed scramble for job security.

Thousands of job-hungry Turks squeezed into a sports hall on Friday in the slim hope of winning a low-paid state post in a fierce competition which has highlighted Turkey's chronic unemployment.

Concerns about decreasing job security as the country moves towards privatisation drew around 90,000 people to examinations in Ankara for 2,500 mostly clerical jobs at Turkey's social security organisation (SSK) over the next three days.

Union estimates put unemployment as high as 27 percent.

"There's no work where I come from and nobody invests there. We've got no choice but to give this a try," said Serajttin Demir, a 29-year-old father of two who came with some 170 others from the eastern province of Van, 16 hours from Ankara by coach.

He was one of many who have joined a mass exodus to cities in recent years because of economic decline in rural areas.

"I have worked in the private sector, but there is no security. Privatisation will make that worse. It will only benefit the rich," said 30-year-old Ibrahim Levent from Ankara.

"The unemployment situation is drastic and the government is taking no measures to curb the situation," Yildirim Koc, adviser to the head of the Turk-Is union confederation, told Reuters.

He estimated that between four million and five million of Turkey's 23-million-strong workforce were unemployed, but said comparisons with Western countries were difficult because of the high level of casual employment.

Among the crowds spilling out on to the streets around the sports hall on Friday there was scepticism about the chances of an SSK job following media speculation that the Islamist-led government would select sympathisers for state jobs.

"They've already chosen their own people. I think I'm better off here selling tea," said one of dozens of traders who gathered in the rain outside to sell anything from leather jackets to pieces of cardboard, on which applicants could balance their exam papers in the crowded sports hall.

"The unemployed came from the four corners of Turkey to Ankara, they waited in queues for days, they were made to look stupid," said Hurriyet newspaper columnist Emin Colasan, echoing concerns that the government would only employ sympathisers.

Last month police intervened to prevent crowd disturbance when tens of thousands of the job hopefuls scrambled to get application papers for the exams at a government building.

Many of those competing come from the poorer rural parts of Turkey, including the southeast, where a 12-year-old conflict between security forces and Kurdish rebels has kept the region economically backward.

"We believe unemployment is a fertile ground on which such social evils are bred," Koc said, citing the Kurdish insurgency.

He called on the government to promote agriculture, in particular small producers. Agriculture accounts for around 15 percent of Turkey's gross domestic product.
