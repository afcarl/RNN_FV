Cyprus Airways pilots put strike on hold.

NICOSIA 1996-12-06

Cyprus Airways pilots said on Friday they had suspended threats to go on strike after their union agreed to meet aviation chiefs to discuss demands.

Pilots' union Pasipi had earlier threatened to go on strike unless a pilot suspended from duty was back at work by the weekend.

Industrial action, a union announcement said, has been put on hold in view of a meeting its representatives will have with civil aviation authorities on Saturday.

Pasipi had demanded the reinstatement of one of its members grounded by the airline after a flight incident in July.

The dispute prompted a 48-hour strike threat from Pasipi at the peak of the holiday season in August.

The strike was called off at the last minute after appeals from the government, which controls 80 percent of the airline.
