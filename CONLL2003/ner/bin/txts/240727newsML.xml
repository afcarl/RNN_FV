<p>The Israeli government's long-awaited privatisation programme has been completed and is only awaiting a review by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one of his aides said.</p>
<p>Moshe Leon, deputy director-general of the prime minister's office, told Reuters on Thursday that approval was being held up because Netanyahu was preoccupied with Israel's negotiations with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Leon said he expected the programme would be approved and announced later this month.</p>
<p>Market sources said they expected the privatisations would be greeted favourably in foreign markets, despite concerns about the political situation and a slowing Israeli economy.</p>
<p>Floating shares domestically, however, will be more difficult, they said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has made privatisation one of the key planks in his government's effort to revive Israel's flagging economic growth.</p>
<p>The government's 1997 budget foresees revenues of 4.3 billion shekels ($1.3 billion) from the sale of government-owned companies, compared with about 580 million shekels raised this year.</p>
<p>But Shlomo Simonovski, joint managing director of Meitav Investments and Securities, said he thought the revenue target was ambitious. &quot;It looks like this won't be easy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv share market has been in a slump since 1994 and virtually no new equity issues have been made this year, although the government did succeed in floating shares and warrants equal to nearly 16 percent of Israel Discount Bank in March.</p>
<p>&quot;The atmosphere in the market is good now, but it all depends on cutting the budget. If they do, people will be more confident about putting money into stocks and bonds,&quot; Simonovski said.</p>
<p>The government is seeking to cut next year's spending by as much as seven billion shekels, but the budget has met widespread opposition in parliament.</p>
<p>Simonovski said the government would have to price issues cheaply to attract capital. Since shares in most of the key privatisation candidates are already traded, the government would have to offer sweeteners in the form of warrants and convertible bonds.</p>
<p>The previous Labour government had sought to arouse interest with a vouchers programme that would have entitled Israelis to buy privatisation issues at discounts to their market price. But Leon said he did not believe the new privatisation programme would include a vouchers plan.</p>
<p>Overseas, Israeli privatisation issues should have an easier time, said Stephen Marquardt, managing director of investment banking at Merrill Lynch in London.</p>
<p>Concerns about the future of Middle East peace were exaggerated, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We just priced the (Israeli) Eurobond issue at the bottom of the price range and it was received well,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that is a very strong statement of investors' perception of Israel.&quot;</p>
<p>On Thursday Israel completed a five-year, $200 million in Eurobond issue that carries a 6.375 rate of interest. It was Israel's debut Eurobond offering.</p>
<p>&quot;When the government makes its mind up, I think the reception will be good,&quot; Marquardt said.</p>
