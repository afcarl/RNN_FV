PLO negotiators said on Friday a three-way PLO, Israel, Egypt summit to clinch a deal on the West Bank town of Hebron could happen on Saturday in Cairo but Israeli and Palestinian officials said no summit had been set.

Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say they are willing to meet.

But Arafat's spokesmen said key points still needed to be resolved to ensure a successful meeting. Netanyahu told his cabinet ministers it was up to Arafat to decide to progress.

"It is very possible that Arafat and Netanyahu will meet in Cairo on Saturday. There is work on arranging such a meeting hosted by (Egyptian) President (Hosni) Mubarak," one PLO official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters.

Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu Rdainah said in reaction:

"President Arafat is ready to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu but no time or date has been set for such a meeting yet.

"Such a meeting should come after successful negotiations so that the meeting would have positive results. Especially since the Hebron issue has not been agreed yet and the crucial disputed issues have not been resolved." Rdainah said Arafat would go to Cairo on Saturday for talks with Mubarak.

Palestinians say longstanding sticking points like Israel's demand it be permitted to chase wanted persons in the 80 percent of Hebron to fall under PLO rule have still to be resolved. The PLO rejects the demand, saying it would nullify autonomy.

Israel's cabinet statement quoted Netanyahu as saying:

"The negotiations on the issue of Hebron have been exhausted and it is possible to conclude the problems that are left by a meeting at the political level as long as the other side does not at the last moment raise new obstacles.

"The true question...is whether the Palestinian side is interested in reaching a conclusion."

Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi rejected the idea the deal was almost done and the charge Palestinians were stalling.

"That 'almost' has hidden within it several important, cardinal points which are still not agreed on," Tibi told Israel Radio. "There is a signed agreement and the entire world knows that Yasser Arafat will never change the agreement."

The deal handing most of Hebron to Palestinian rule was signed more than a year ago by Israel's previous government and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).

In more two months of talks the sides have consistently accused each other of stalling.

Netanyahu has insisted changes must be made to it to enhance security for 400 Jewish settlers who live in the town amidst 100,000 Palestinians. Israel captured and occupied Hebron with the rest of the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war.

Netanyahu's office said he met U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk on the talks with the PLO. Israel's Haaretz daily said U.S. Consul General to Jerusalem Edward Abington met Arafat last night. There was no confirmation of that report.

David Bar-Illan, director of communications in Netanyahu's office, said no summit had been set.

"It will only come if an agreement is reached on the redeployment in Hebron, otherwise I don't think it would make very much sense," Bar-Illan told Reuters.

Netanyahu ousted the former government in May elections. He rejects trading occupied Arab land for peace, formerly the key to peace talks but says he'll honour signed deals.

Israel's far right has been outraged at Netanyahu's stated intention to honour the Hebron deal.

Israel's Maariv and Yedioth newspapers said on Friday that in light of "warnings from Jewish and Arab sources" Israel's Shin Bet secret service has tightened security around Netanyahu. The prime minister's office refused to comment on the report.
