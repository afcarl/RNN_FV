<title>TURKEY: Turkey revises up cotton output estimates.</title>
<headline>Turkey revises up cotton output estimates.</headline>
<dateline>IZMIR 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Turkey revised its 1996/97 (Oct-July) cotton output estimate to 792,414 tonnes from a previous 783,735, and put the 1995/96 outturn at 851,487 tonnes, compared with a previous 837,114, officials said.</p>
<p>The revisions were annouced after a cotton advisory group meeting at the Izmir Trade Bourse.</p>
<p>Cotton area was put at 750,163 hectares for 1996/97, down from 756,694 in 1995/96, and yields at 1.056 tonnes per hectare, down from 1.125 in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Officials from Turkey's four cotton growing regions and the agriculture ministry were unable to give an exact import figure for 1995/96 due to delayed trade data caused by technical difficulties.</p>
<p>They estimated imports at 150,000 tonnes for 1995/96, saying the exact figure would be announced at their next meeting, scheduled for June 1997.</p>
<p>Total cotton supply in 1995/96 was 1,139,059 tonnes, including imports and 137,572 tonnes of stocks from the previous season. Domestic consumption in 1995/96 was put at 950,000 tonnes and exports at 58,465 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;Turkey became a cotton importer while it was an exporter in the 1980s. But we may approach this positively because imported cotton is consumed in Turkey, creating employment and added value in the economy,&quot; said Tugrul Balikcioglu of the ministry's production department.</p>
<p>&quot;Turkey has productivity problems (in cotton). We must raise productivity in cultivated areas,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Balikcioglu added that cotton was crucial to self-sufficiency in Turkey's textile industry, whose total exports of $8.5 billion in 1995 were the country's top money earner.</p>
<p>Turkish textile producers frequently resort to cotton imports to meet quality standards in their exports.</p>
<p>Officials said the cotton area was falling in the southern Cukurova region and was at saturation point in the leading Aegean and southwest Antalya regions.</p>
<p>They saw the only growth potential in area in the southeast, where irrigation was slowly expanding as the $32 billion Southeast Anatolia Project (GAP) in energy and irrigation progressed.</p>
<p>Officials from the three commodity trade bourses repeated calls for the reinstatement of a premium system in the government's cotton pricing policy in 1996/97. Premiums were abolished after the 1993/94 season.</p>
