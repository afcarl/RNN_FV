Lebanese pound strengthens in quiet market.

BEIRUT 1996-12-06

The Lebanese pound strengthened against the dollar in the week ended Friday with quiet trade confined to the bottom of the Bank of Lebanon's intervention band, dealers said.

The central bank twice adjusted its bid-offer intervention band by 50 piastres during the week to reach 1,549-1,558 Lebanese pounds per dollar from 1,550-1,558 at last Friday's close, they said.

The Beirut interbank market trades within the intervention band which the Bank of Lebanon introduced on September 24.

Three dealers said the pound traded throughout the week at 1,549.0-1,549.50 per dollar.

"The market was calm this week and trading was close to the central bank's bid...reflecting a supply of dollars," one dealer said, adding trading volume was about $8-$15 million per day.

"People are relaxed and there is no pressure on the Lebanese pound...All the demand (for dollars) was met from the market not the central bank and the banks then sold the excess of dollars to the central bank at its bid price," he added.

A second dealer said trading volume averaged about $10 million per day. The supply of dollars was mainly due to Lebanese investors rushing to lock in higher yields on pound-denominated treasury bills which are falling.

"As you know the interest rates on the Lebanese pound are going down so people are selling dollars for pounds to buy treasury bills," he added.
