Cyprus puts new hopes in Albright for breakthrough.

NICOSIA 1996-12-06

Cyprus on Friday congratulated Madeleine Albright on her appointment as U.S. Secretary of State and expressed hopes her knowledge of the long-standing dispute dividing the island would work to Cyprus's benefit.

"There is no doubt that when the U.S. Secretary of State is familiar with the Cyprus problem this is an advantage to our national issue," government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides told a news briefing.

President Bill Clinton on Thursday named Albright, his U.N. ambassador for nearly four years, as secretary of state to replace Warren Christopher.

The United States is expected to launch an initiative in coming months to spur negotiations between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities on the island.

Turkey invaded northern Cyprus in 1974 after a coup in Nicosia engineered by the military junta in Greece.

A small army of mediators, including Albright, have tried to make headway in the dispute for years but have failed to achieve progress to reunite the island under a federal umbrella.

In her capacity as Washington's ambassador to the United Nations Albright visited Cyprus in July where she had meetings with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
