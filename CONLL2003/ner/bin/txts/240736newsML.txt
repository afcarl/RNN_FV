RABAT 1996-12-06

Morocco is to buy nine locomotives worth 280 million dirhams ($31.8 million) from GEC-Alsthom, an official at the national railways office (ONCF) said on Friday.

The engines are for delivery at the end of 1998 and early 1999. They haul up to 1,200 tonnes at a speed of up to 120 km per hour (75 mph).

Transport Minister Said Ameskane signed the agreement earlier this week, the ONCF official said.

The order is part of a five year investment plan ending in 2000 estimated at 5.2 billion dirhams.
