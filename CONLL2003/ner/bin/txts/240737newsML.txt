Solidere end week mixed after GDR issue.

BEIRUT 1996-12-06

Solidere shares were mixed on the Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE) on increased turnover in the week ended on Friday, more than a week after the company made a $77-million issue of Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs).

A shares fell to $113 from $113.375 on last Friday and B shares closed at $117.125 slightly up from $117.

Turnover in Solidere shares rose to 91,748 shares from last week's 76,376 and value was 10,431,317 from $8,447,309.

Dealers said the higher volume of shares changed hands reflects investor interest in Solidere shares after last Wednesday's issue of the GDRs.

"There were daily blocs of demand and obviously higher volume of traded shares than last week, and this reflects the investors interest after the GDR issue," one dealer said.

The GDRs, each of which nominally represents one-tenth of an A share, were last quoted at $11.6 on the London Stock Exchange Automated Quotation system (SEAQ). They allow non-Arabs access to the market in Solidere for the first time.

Also traded on the BSE during the week were 1,830 shares of Ciments Libanais at $1.21875 down from last week's $1.25, and 100 shares of pipe making Eternit company at $1.75 down from $1.8125 when they were last traded on November 21.

There was no trade in the two other listed companies: Ciments Blancs  SCBB.BY, and Uniceramic.

The LISPI stock index fell 0.89 percent on the week to 82.71 and the BLOM stock index also fell 0.51 percent to 966.68.
