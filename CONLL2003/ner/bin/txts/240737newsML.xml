<headline>Solidere end week mixed after GDR issue.</headline>

<text>
<p>Solidere shares were mixed on the Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE) on increased turnover in the week ended on Friday, more than a week after the company made a $77-million issue of Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs).</p>
<p>A shares fell to $113 from $113.375 on last Friday and B shares closed at $117.125 slightly up from $117.</p>
<p>Turnover in Solidere shares rose to 91,748 shares from last week's 76,376 and value was 10,431,317 from $8,447,309.</p>
<p>Dealers said the higher volume of shares changed hands reflects investor interest in Solidere shares after last Wednesday's issue of the GDRs.</p>
<p>&quot;There were daily blocs of demand and obviously higher volume of traded shares than last week, and this reflects the investors interest after the GDR issue,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The GDRs, each of which nominally represents one-tenth of an A share, were last quoted at $11.6 on the London Stock Exchange Automated Quotation system (SEAQ). They allow non-Arabs access to the market in Solidere for the first time.</p>
<p>Also traded on the BSE during the week were 1,830 shares of Ciments Libanais at $1.21875 down from last week's $1.25, and 100 shares of pipe making Eternit company at $1.75 down from $1.8125 when they were last traded on November 21.</p>
<p>There was no trade in the two other listed companies: Ciments Blancs  SCBB.BY, and Uniceramic.</p>
<p>The LISPI stock index fell 0.89 percent on the week to 82.71 and the BLOM stock index also fell 0.51 percent to 966.68.</p>
