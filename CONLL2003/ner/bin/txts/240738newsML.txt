Gulf tariff unification is unlikely, say analysts.

Tariff unification among Gulf Arab states would jump-start free trade with other economic blocs, but the priorities of regional governments are so far apart that analysts doubt they will take the plunge any time soon.

Differences among the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman -- have blocked a tariff agreement almost since the political and economic alliance was founded in 1981.

And economists say that when GCC leaders meet for their annual summit in the Qatari capital of Doha on Saturday, the scheduled talks to forge ahead with a tariff accord are unlikely to bear fruit.

"They agreed to unify their tariffs in principle 15 years ago and until now it has never materialised," leading Saudi economist Ihsan Bu-Hulaiga told Reuters.

"At the summit on Saturday they may agree on the tariffs but it is not expected that such an agreement will be concluded because views are still different on this issue."

Standard customs tariffs among the GCC states range from four to 12 percent, with special tariffs for some industries.

"There is a protective tariff in Saudi Arabia of 20 percent. In Kuwait the same tariff is 50 percent. The UAE doesn't have one at all," one Gulf economist said.

A common rate of between six and eight percent has been discussed as the most likely if and when duties are unified.

Analysts say the main obstacles to unifying tariffs are the divergent economic priorities of the Gulf states.

They said regional economic heavyweight Saudi Arabia, which is striving towards industrialisation and seeking to move from import-substitution to an export economy, prefers higher tariffs to support its infant industries.

"They want to make it worthwhile for their industries to compete locally, otherwise the competitiveness of the local products will be undermined by cheap imports," Bu-Hulaiga said.

Other Gulf states like the UAE -- with the lowest tariffs in the Gulf -- instead focus on becoming a trade centre. The tiny Gulf island state of Bahrain -- the least wealthy in the region -- depends on tariff revenues to bolster state income, analysts said.

"The tariff issue is touching the fundamental economic policies of each of the GCC states," Bu-Hulaiga said.

Analysts say another stumbling block is the lack of a common classification for goods to help decide on unified tariffs.

The tariffs issue is a key hurdle in the way of a free trade deal with the European Union which could open lucrative European markets to cheap petrochemicals and other goods from the Gulf.

GCC and EU foreign ministers agreed in April to set a deadline of no more than two years to complete a free trade accord between the two trading partners -- an issue under discussion for more than 10 years.

The issue also represents an impediment to the Gulf's full integration into the World Trade Organisation, analysts said.

"A unified tariff will be of immense economic benefit to the GCC countries," an economist said. "They need to do it."

While the GCC acknowledges hurdles remain, it said a summary of alternatives on how to unify tariffs would be presented at the Doha summit and could help clinch an accord.

"I expect that the GCC leaders will reach an agreement on the subject," said Abdulla Al-Khulaifi, GCC assistant secretary general for economic affairs.
