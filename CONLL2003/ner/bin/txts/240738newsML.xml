<p>Tariff unification among Gulf Arab states would jump-start free trade with other economic blocs, but the priorities of regional governments are so far apart that analysts doubt they will take the plunge any time soon.</p>
<p>Differences among the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman -- have blocked a tariff agreement almost since the political and economic alliance was founded in 1981.</p>
<p>And economists say that when GCC leaders meet for their annual summit in the Qatari capital of Doha on Saturday, the scheduled talks to forge ahead with a tariff accord are unlikely to bear fruit.</p>
<p>&quot;They agreed to unify their tariffs in principle 15 years ago and until now it has never materialised,&quot; leading Saudi economist Ihsan Bu-Hulaiga told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;At the summit on Saturday they may agree on the tariffs but it is not expected that such an agreement will be concluded because views are still different on this issue.&quot;</p>
<p>Standard customs tariffs among the GCC states range from four to 12 percent, with special tariffs for some industries.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a protective tariff in Saudi Arabia of 20 percent. In Kuwait the same tariff is 50 percent. The UAE doesn't have one at all,&quot; one Gulf economist said.</p>
<p>A common rate of between six and eight percent has been discussed as the most likely if and when duties are unified.</p>
<p>Analysts say the main obstacles to unifying tariffs are the divergent economic priorities of the Gulf states.</p>
<p>They said regional economic heavyweight Saudi Arabia, which is striving towards industrialisation and seeking to move from import-substitution to an export economy, prefers higher tariffs to support its infant industries.</p>
<p>&quot;They want to make it worthwhile for their industries to compete locally, otherwise the competitiveness of the local products will be undermined by cheap imports,&quot; Bu-Hulaiga said.</p>
<p>Other Gulf states like the UAE -- with the lowest tariffs in the Gulf -- instead focus on becoming a trade centre. The tiny Gulf island state of Bahrain -- the least wealthy in the region -- depends on tariff revenues to bolster state income, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The tariff issue is touching the fundamental economic policies of each of the GCC states,&quot; Bu-Hulaiga said.</p>
<p>Analysts say another stumbling block is the lack of a common classification for goods to help decide on unified tariffs.</p>
<p>The tariffs issue is a key hurdle in the way of a free trade deal with the European Union which could open lucrative European markets to cheap petrochemicals and other goods from the Gulf.</p>
<p>GCC and EU foreign ministers agreed in April to set a deadline of no more than two years to complete a free trade accord between the two trading partners -- an issue under discussion for more than 10 years.</p>
<p>The issue also represents an impediment to the Gulf's full integration into the World Trade Organisation, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;A unified tariff will be of immense economic benefit to the GCC countries,&quot; an economist said. &quot;They need to do it.&quot;</p>
<p>While the GCC acknowledges hurdles remain, it said a summary of alternatives on how to unify tariffs would be presented at the Doha summit and could help clinch an accord.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect that the GCC leaders will reach an agreement on the subject,&quot; said Abdulla Al-Khulaifi, GCC assistant secretary general for economic affairs.</p>
