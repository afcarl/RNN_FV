U.N. commission to move headquarters to Beirut.

BEIRUT 1996-12-06

The U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific will move back its permanent headquarters to Beirut next September, the commission's secretary general said on Friday.

"There is an initial agreement to move to Beirut next summer during the month of September," ESCWA secretary general Hazem al-Biblawi told reporters upon his arrival to Beirut airport.

ESCWA had moved its main offices to Baghdad in 1982 during the height of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, the commission moved to Amman.

"The return of ESCWA to Beirut indicates that the international community recognises the return of normal life to Lebanon which is re-emerging as a key center for the region," he added.

Biblawi is due to meet Lebanon's top political leaders during his one-day vist before returning back to Amman.
