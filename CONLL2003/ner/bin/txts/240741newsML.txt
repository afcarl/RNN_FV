Commodities fund to study switch of finances.

RABAT 1996-12-06

The Common Fund for Commodities is to consider switching more finance into projects aimed at diversifying developing countries' commodity production, the official Moroccan news agency MAP said.

The recommendation was adopted at a meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco, of the fund's governing council, it said in a report late on Thursday.

A summary of operations of the fund's Second Account -- devoted to supporting development projects -- said that by the end of 1996 it had backed 49 projects covering 20 commodities at a total cost of $118.1 million.

The governors decided their next meeting would be in Amsterdam in December 1997.
