<p>Many Israelis believe there is a danger of war with Arab states and do not trust Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister of the country, according to a Gallup poll published in Israel's Maariv daily on Friday.</p>
<p>Asked if they saw a danger of war between Israel and Arab states, 63 percent said the danger existed, 29 percent said it did not and eight percent did not know.</p>
<p>On the question of whether they trusted Netanyahu as prime minister, 49 percent said they did not, 38 percent trusted him and 13 percent did not know.</p>
<p>Respondents expressed dissatisfaction with Netanyahu, who took power in June, on the economic front.</p>
<p>Asked about Netanyahu's handling of economic issues, only one percent said they were &quot;very satisfied&quot;, 17 percent were &quot;satisfied&quot;, 25 percent rated it &quot;so-so&quot;, 44 percent said they were &quot;dissatisfied&quot; or &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; and 13 percent did not know.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has promised a big privatisation programme and cuts in Israel's 1997 budget deficit.</p>
<p>Only 23 percent expressed satisfaction with Netanyahu's handling of negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Syria, 28 percent rated it &quot;so-so&quot;, 42 percent said they were &quot;dissatisfied&quot; or &quot;very dissatisfied&quot;, and seven percent said they did not know.</p>
<p>But the respondents spread blame for tension in the region, with 42 percent blaming it on Arab states, 24 percent on Israel's government, 21 percent on both, and 13 percent saying they did not know.</p>
<p>Those questioned were evenly divided on whether they supported evacuating the 400 Jewish settlers living amidst 100,000 Palestinians in Hebron from the West Bank town: 42 percent supported evacuation, 43 percent opposed, and 15 percent did not know.</p>
<p>Israel and the PLO have been in talks on implementing a long-delayed Israeli handover of most of Hebron to the PLO. The deal does not include evacuation of the settlers. Jewish settlement in lands Israeli occupied in the 1967 Middle East war is to be negotiated at final peace talks which have yet to resume under Netanyahu.</p>
<p>The poll was conducted this week and it queried 484 Israeli Jewish adults. It had a 4.5 percent margin of error.</p>
