PLO says Arafat-Netanyahu meeting likely Saturday.

JERUSALEM 1996-12-06

PLO negotiators said on Friday it was possible that Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak would all meet on Saturday to try to clinch a deal on Israel's handover of Hebron to the PLO.

"It is very possible that Arafat and Netanyahu will meet in Cairo on Saturday. There is work on arranging such a meeting hosted by President Mubarak," one PLO official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters.  

Israeli officials said no meeting had yet been set. Both Palestinian President Arafat and Netanyahu have expressed willingness to meet. They last met in Washington after clashes in September that killed 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis.

The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) negotiators said the last two weeks of negotiations with Israel on implementing the long-delayed handover of most of Hebron to PLO rule had been "meaningless", necessitating an Arafat-Netanyahu meeting.

Mubarak's adviser Osama el-Baz said on Thursday there were efforts to arrange a meeting between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Palestinian Authority Secretary General Ahmed Abdel-Rahman said on Thursday he understood it could be held in Cairo either on Friday or Sunday.

Abdel-Rahman had said on Thursday he did not think Saturday would be the date because it is the Jewish sabbath. But the Jewish sabbath ends at sundown, so a night meeting would not interfere with the religious observance.
