<headline>Florida judge says anti-tobacco claim looks strong.</headline>
<dateline>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Florida judge said Friday that he was inclined to let stand civil claims filed under state anti-racketeering laws against the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>Speaking from the bench at the start of a preliminary hearing, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Harold Cohen said he was inclined to let stand claims filed by the state using Florida's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupts Organisations Act, which could mean more losses for cigarette makers.</p>
<p>&quot;It would seem that the state can maintain the RICO actions,&quot; Cohen said.</p>
<p>The claims under state RICO laws were added last month to the state's existing lawsuit that seeks at least $1 billion compensation for treating smokers' illnesses.</p>
<p>The judge said he would not make up his mind until the end of oral arguments on Friday.</p>
<p>He gave no timetable for making public his decision on a request by Philip Morris Cos. and other cigarette makers that the claims made by the state under RICO laws be thrown out.</p>
<p>Florida State Attorney General Bob Butterworth said before the hearing that a victory against tobacco companies using the RICO law would allow the court to triple the more than $1 billion dollars in damages claimed by the state.</p>
<p>He also said a victory in Florida using its RICO law would widen the war against the tobbaco industry by possibly allowing other states to sue under their own RICO laws.</p>
<p>The state of Florida in 1995 filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry, requesting $1 billion or more for health care costs paid for poor people afflicted with smoking-related ailments.</p>
<p>Last month the state amended the suit using the RICO law and claiming that the tobacco companies had conspired with one another to confuse Americans about the dangers of smoking.</p>
