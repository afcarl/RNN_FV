Stocks fall after Greenspan remarks spook markets.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Stocks tumbled early Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning of "irrational exuberance" in asset markets worried investors and caused a sell-off at stock exchanges around the world.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 117.39 points to 6,319.71 in the first half hour of trading. In the broader market, declining issues swamped advances on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq composite index tumbled 37.59 points to 1,262.53.

The New York Stock Exchange said limits on computer-driven programme trading were put in effect at the opening.

Stocks had been expected to open sharply lower after Greenspan's remarks. The central bank chairman, in a speech in Washington on Thursday night, stopped short of directly referring to the recent stock market rally but analysts expressed little doubt about the impact of his message.

Stocks in London, Paris, Frankfurt and Tokyo tumbled overnight after Greenspan's remarks suggested that current levels might be overdone.

Bond prices also fell and the dollar weakened.

U.S. blue-chip stocks have soared 25 percent this year and major European markets have hit record highs in recent weeks, leading some analysts to worry that market may be heading for a crash.

In his remarks, Greenspan made clear that the central bank needed to factor the activities of bears and bulls on Wall Street into its deliberations on interest rates.

He said the central bank could not afford to underestimate the complex links between the prices of stocks, real estate and other assets and the economy.

But it was not clear what, if anything, the Fed could do if central bankers fear that financial markets have gotten ahead of themselves and are setting themselves up for a crash.

If the Fed's policy-makers decide to raise interest rates to cool off speculative fervor, they risk triggering the very collapse they are seeking to avoid, analysts said.

Fed policy-makers hold their next policy-making meeting on Dec. 17 and are widely expected to hold interest rates steady amid signs of moderate economic growth with steady inflation.
