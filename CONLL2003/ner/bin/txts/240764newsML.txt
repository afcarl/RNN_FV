Unemployment edged up to 5.4 percent in November.

The unemployment rate edged higher in November as the economy pumped out new jobs at a slower pace, the Labour Department said on Friday.

The department, in the government's first assessment of the economy's vitality in November, said unemployment rose to 5.4 percent last month as 118,000 new jobs were created.

The unemployment rate had been 5.2 percent in October and the economy had created a revised 224,000 jobs, previously reported as 210,000, the department said.

Wall Street economists surveyed by Reuters had projected the November unemployment rate would remain unchanged and that some 179,000 jobs would be produced.

Workers' average hourly earnings, closely watched for signs of wage inflation, rose nine cents an hour, after being down a revised one cent an hour in October.

The report seemed to give additional weight to the view that the economy has been chugging along at a slowing pace with few signs that inflation was becoming a problem.

"Its another example of how the economy has slowed down dramatically," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Chase Regional Bank.

"One hundred eighteen thousand (new) jobs is the weakest in recent memory and the fact is that most of the jobs that were created were service jobs and retail jobs, most of which were lower paying."

The Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book summary of national economic activity, released on Wednesday, appeared to suggest that slow but steady expansion was ahead, with little need for interest-rate rises to dampen inflation risks.

The central bank's policy-makers meet later this month to decide the future course of interest rates.

Bond prices, which tumbled overnight on Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning late on Thursday about "exuberance" in financial markets, recovered after the jobs report.

The report encouraged investors that Fed policy-makers would probably hold rates steady at their meeting, rather than raise rates in a bid to slow the economy and ward off inflation.

The 30-year Treasury, which fell more than 1-1/4 points earlier, traded down 5/32, or $1.56 on a $1,000 bond, raising its yield to 6.52 percent from 6.51 percent on Thursday.

"The 5.4 percent unemployment rate should provide some comfort to people concerned about tight labour markets," Dan Seto, senior economist at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc., said. "But that provides only very little comfort because we had an average hourly earnings rise of 0.8 percent.

"We're not sure what this means yet."

The Labour Department said job creation during the month reflected gains, some of them modest, across the board with the exception of government work, which showed a decline.

The workweek rose by 0.2 hours last month to 34.5, while overtime increased by 0.1 hours to 4.5 hours.

Goods-producing industries created 22,000 jobs, while the government cut jobs by an identical amount.

The largest gains were in the services area, which rose by 96,000, while construction added 14,000, and manufacturing added 9,000.
