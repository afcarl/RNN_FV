Bad weather delays shuttle astronauts' return home.

NASA ordered the U.S. astronauts aboard the Columbia to skip their first possible landing attempt on Friday morning, but said the shuttle might be able to land once early morning sunshine burned away patches of fog on its Florida runway.

A combination of fog and low clouds from a cold front moving across Florida made the planned 8:01 a.m. EST (1301 GMT) touchdown unsafe, said Eileen Hawley, a spokeswoman for the space agency.

If the weather cleared in time, the astronauts would have a second chance to land on Friday at 9:38 a.m. EST (1438 EST).

"The flight control team advised the crew aboard Columbia that the first opportunity would be waved off in hopes of better conditions for a second opportunity," she said.

The shuttle's main back-up landing strip at Edwards Air Force Base in California was ruled out for Friday because of gusty winds.

The astronauts are equipped with five additional days' worth of food, oxygen and supplies and can safely remain in orbit until one of its two primary landing sites is available.

The crew includes veteran astronaut Story Musgrave, who at 61 is the oldest man ever to fly in space. Musgrave was making his final shuttle mission in a career of more than three decades at NASA.

The delay also pushed Columbia's crew closer to setting a new record for longest shuttle flight. If the orbiter lands on Friday morning, it will rank as the second-longest shuttle mission, falling shy of a record by just four hours.

The record for the longest mission was set last July by a different crew aboard the Columbia, which stayed aloft for 17 days.

On Saturday, weather forecasts call for marginal conditions at Kennedy Space Centre but clear skies and good weather at Edwards, Hawley said. The space agency prefers to land the shuttle in Florida whenever possible to save the $1 million cost of ferrying the orbiter from California.

Cloudy skies thwarted the shuttle's planned landing on Thursday. The crew was just minutes away from firing Columbia's braking rockets to begin their descent when flight controllers called off the planned 8:10 a.m. EST (1310 GMT) landing.

The weather in Florida had been expected to improve on Friday, contrary to a forecast earlier in the week that had caused NASA to order the shuttle home one day earlier than planned.

The mission, which began on Nov. 19, was marred by a jammed airlock hatch that forced NASA to cancel a pair of space walks. Astronauts Tammy Jernigan and Tom Jones spent months training for the spacewalks, which had been intended to test construction tools for the planned permanent space station.

The astronauts were awakened at 9:26 p.m. EST (0226 GMT) on Thursday evening to begin stowing gear and making other landing preparations.

"Good morning, Columbia. It's flight day 17 and we're ready to bring you home," said ground controller Marc Garneau after playing an audiocassette of "Nobody Does It Better" to wake up the crew.

Another problem cropped up this week when a crucial navigation tool stopped working. The shuttle is equipped with two other back-up inertial measurement units to guide it home.

The astronauts released and later retrieved two science satellites. A U.S.-German telescope studied the life cycles of stars and a prototype computer chip factory manufactured ultra-pure semiconductors for the electronics industry.
