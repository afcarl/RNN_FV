U.S. spot MTBE prices gained about a cent a gallon after a methanol plant near Houston exploded earlier this week, leaving many traders with more questons than answers regarding the duration of the outage.

Prices for methanol, a key feedstock used to make MTBE, have moved up about four cents since Tuesday's blast at the Hoechst Celanese plant to about 49.75 cents a gallon.  

A 50,000 barrel MTBE deal in Houston was heard done on Wednesday at 86.50 a gallon, though that could not be immediately confirmed.

But a 50,000 deal done Thursday in New York Harbor was confirmed at 91.00 cents a gallon -- about in line with the Houston-New York spread, which was assessed at between 4.25 and 4.50 cents.

Traders said that while MTBE markets have been far from tight recently, the Hoechst fire and outage could bring a measure of bullishness to the market. Hoechst said the plant will be down for "weeks." Some traders are saying "months."
