Stratton Oakmont expelled from securities industry.

WASHINGTON

The National Association of Securities Dealers' regulatory arm said Thursday it expelled New York brokerage Stratton Oakmont from the securities industry for "willful disregard" of regulations.

While imposing the strongest sanction available against an errant brokerage, the self-regulatory organisation also barred from industry the firm's president, Daniel M. Porush, and head trader Steven Sanders. Porush was also censured and fined $250,000 and Sanders censured and fined $25,000.

The firm, which deals in low-priced "penny" stocks, was ordered to pay $416,528 in restitution to customers, fined $500,000 and censured.

The penalties were based on an appeal by the brokerage over sanctions involving excessive and fraudulent markups involving a public stock offering in 1993 and failure to supervise the firm's staff to prevent those violations.

The penalties also take into account the firm's "extensive and serious regulatory history and an obvious disregard for all rules of fair practice," said NASDR President Mary Schapiro.

"This firm has time after time after time shown a total disregard for customers, for the integrity of the market and their responsibilities they have as a broker dealer," Schapiro said. The expulsion rids the securities industry of one of its "worst actors," she added.

Schapiro said the firm has the right to appeal its decision to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The firm's customer accounts will be handled by J.B. Oxford, a Los Angeles-based firm, she said.

The self regulatory NASD, through NASD Regulation Inc., regulates more than 5,000 member firms and more than 510,000 registered securities industry representatives. The SEC has oversight over the NASD, which also runs, through another corporation, the Nasdaq stock market.

Charles Stillman, a lawyer representing the firm, called the NASDR decision "unprecedented and oppressive" and said it ignored the firm's efforts to "remedy old wrongs."

"We are petitioning the Securities and Exchange Commission to stay this outrageous decision while it is under review," he said in a statement.

He said the petition would be filed Thursday. Under its procedures, one of the its four commissioners who acts as duty officer overnight can decide whether to grant the petition or not.

If the petition is denied, Stratton Oakmont will practically be out of business by Friday.

Stratton Oakmont, which joined the NASD in 1987, has been accused in various enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission, state regulators and the NASD itself.

Since June 1989, it has been the subject of 12 disciplinary actions by the NASD, including charges of securities fraud, manipulation, unlawful markups, breaking of market-making restrictions and other infractions.

NASDR has a pending lawsuit against Porush and Sanders in which it alleged manipulation and fraud in a scheme that supposedly produced $28 million in illegal profits. The case is scheduled for hearing in January.

In 1994, the firm settled charges by the SEC that it engaged in "boiler-room" operations that included high pressure sales tactics and lying about risks involved in speculative stocks.

But the SEC later charged the firm did not abide by the settlement by failing to adopt procedures to prevent recurrence of alleged violations. In February 1995, the SEC obtained a permanent injunction against the firm, ordering it to comply with the settlement terms.
