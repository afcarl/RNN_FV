<p>Midwestern electric utilities slammed a Massachusetts initiative that would discourage sales of electricity into the Northeast and Washington DC generated by their coal-fired plants.</p>
<p>&quot;The proposal is anti-competitive,&quot; said Cinergy Corp spokesman Steve Brash. Almost all of Cinergy's electricity output comes from coal generation.</p>
<p>Tuesday, Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger sent letters to 12 Northeast states and the District of Columbia to ban or place a surcharge on power from Midwestern coal plants that do not meet strict anti-pollution standards.  </p>
<p>Maine Gov Angus King already voiced support for the measure.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts proposal, according to proponents, would force Midwest states to impose stricter pollution standards on coal-fired plants. Opponents counter that it would likely raise those plant's operating costs.</p>
<p>&quot;There's definitely pressure on coal, which in the Midwest and Southeast there's a lot of,&quot; said Bob Beck, vice-president of environmental affairs at Edison Electric Institute, a Washington DC-based group that represents the nation's investor-owned electric utilities.  </p>
<p>Utilities in the Northeast allege less stringent pollution rules for coal-fired plants in the Midwest give the region's utilities an unfair cost advantage as full industry deregulation looms in the next few years.</p>
<p>Midwest utilities refute charges that emissions from their coal stations have been a culprit for smog, acid rain and other aerial pollution in the Northeast.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a continuing effort by the Northeast states to put the blame on their areas' pollution problems from hundreds of miles away,&quot; Brash said.  </p>
<p>Brash cited a recent study by Environmental Protection Agency's Ozone Transportation Group that concluded even the most severe restriction on power imports from the Midwest would result in little relief for Northeast air pollution.</p>
<p>Midwest utilities surveyed said they are meeting, if not exceeding, plant emission standards set forth by the federal Clean Air Act.</p>
<p>&quot;We're already meeting requirements of the Clean Air Act,&quot; said American Electric Power (AEP) spokesman Pat Hemlepp.  </p>
<p>Since 1990, AEP spent $800 million toward meeting those requirements. It installed scrubbers and precipitators at some of coal-fired plants to cut sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, he said.</p>
<p>The Ohio-based company and subsidiaries operate 24,000 megawatts of generating capacity, of which 88 percent use coal. Their coal-fired stations are in five Midwest states.</p>
<p>&quot;We're a good, clean player,&quot; Hemlepp said. &quot;It provides an unfair characterization of the coal plants in the Midwest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Northeast is simply trying to protect its utility interest at the detriment to their consumers,&quot; Brash said, adding utilities in the Northeast charge some of the highest electric rates in the country.</p>
<p>Industry officials noted the proposal could be challenged on grounds that it violates interstate commerce laws.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be a constitutionality problem...This will be battled between state houses,&quot; Beck said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know if there's a lot of support to tax electricity,&quot; he said, noting the recent bitter battles over a general energy tax and tax hike on gasoline.</p>
