Shell Texas coker down for unplanned work.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Shell Oil Co said it pulled the 50,000 barrel per day (bpd) coker unit at its Deer Park, Texas refinery off line Tuesday for three weeks of unplanned maintenance.

The company did not characterize the nature of the problem, though environmental regulators in Texas said the company discovered a leak in a coking drum earlier this week.  

"It will be down for approxiamately three weeks," a company spokeswoman, who described the maintenance as "unplanned but routine."

Traders on both sides of the Atlantic have been talking about problems at the Deer Park refinery since late Thursday.

Coker units, using feedstocks like residual fuel, produce a coal-like substance used as a fuel by heavy industries, churning out middle distillates like heating oil and jet fuel as a by-product.

The Deer Park refinery, which is jointly run by Shell and the Mexican state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos is located near Houston and has crude distillation capacity of 215,000 barrels per day.

Shell Oil Co is the U.S. unit of Anglo-Dutch major Royal Dutch/Shell Co.
