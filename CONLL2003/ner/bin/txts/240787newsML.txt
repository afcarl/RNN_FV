U.S. Plains fed cattle market quiet, no bids-trade.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06

U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets Friday were quiet following this week's fairly active sales mostly at $68.00 per cwt, feedlot sources said.

A few hundred head of cattle sold Thursday at $67.00, but several feedlot sources did not think the sales were the start of a lower trend for next week.

Feedlots remain current in their marketings of finished cattle, which could lend support to next week's prices, along with ideas that beef prices were near a bottom following this week's steep declines.
