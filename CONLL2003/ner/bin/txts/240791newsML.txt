High Plains Wheat - Basis bids steady to higher.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. 1996-12-06

Basis bids for hard red winter wheat were steady to higher Friday as some locations raised their bids to keep up with one domestic miller, grain merchandisers in the U.S. High Plains said.

Thursday, dealers said Cargill raised its Kansas mill basis bids to 70 cents over the KCBT March contract.

"Last I heard, the bid was good for only a limited time, so we've decided not to chase the business," said one dealer in central Kansas.

But one Oklahoma dealer said that bids had been raised because of firmness in the cash market.  

Basis values in cents/bu against KCBT wheat, cash=dollars/bu.
