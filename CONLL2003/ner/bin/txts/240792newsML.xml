<p>Columbia's crew of five, which includes NASA's oldest astronaut, was set to orbit into the record books after the shuttle's landing was postponed on Friday for a second consecutive day.</p>
<p>Thick fog at the runway at Kennedy Space Centre forced the space agency to call off two planned attempts on Friday morning. NASA briefly considered trying to divert Columbia to a backup landing site at Edwards Air Force Base in California, but gusty winds posed too much of a safety risk.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got Story (Musgrave) up there and now we can't get him back,&quot; joked ground controller Curt Brown when he radioed the news of the postponement to the crew. Musgrave, 61, is NASA's oldest astronaut and making his sixth and final shuttle flight.</p>
<p>The delay means that the Columbia crew will set a record for NASA's longest shuttle mission, staying in space more than 18 days. The current record for shuttle longevity was set by a different crew aboard the Columbia last July, when the orbiter stayed aloft for nearly 17 days.</p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it aimed to bring the shuttle home on Saturday at 6:50 EST (1150 GMT) at Kennedy Space Centre.</p>
<p>&quot;The weather is not going to cooperate with us today,&quot; Brown said. &quot;The good news is that at tomorrow's first opportunity (to land) you will have broken the endurance record by over 18 hours.&quot;</p>
<p>The astronauts are equipped with four additional days' worth of food, oxygen and supplies and the shuttle can safely remain in orbit until one of its two primary landing sites is available, NASA said.</p>
<p>The weather in Florida had been expected to improve on Friday, contrary to a forecast earlier in the week that had caused NASA to order the shuttle home one day earlier than planned.</p>
<p>The mission, which began on Nov. 19, was marred by a jammed airlock hatch that forced NASA to cancel a pair of space walks. Astronauts Tammy Jernigan and Tom Jones spent months training for the spacewalks, which had been intended to test construction tools for the planned permanent space station.</p>
<p>Another problem cropped up this week when a crucial navigation tool stopped working. Although it briefly sprang back to life on Thursday, the astronauts were waked by an alarm in the cockpit when the tool failed for a second time.</p>
<p>The shuttle is equipped with two other backup inertial measurement units to guide it home.</p>
<p>During the mission, the astronauts released and later retrieved two science satellites. A U.S.-German telescope studied the life cycles of stars and a prototype computer chip factory manufactured ultra-pure semiconductors for the electronics industry.</p>
