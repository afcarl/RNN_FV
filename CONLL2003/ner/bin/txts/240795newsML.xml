<p>Following are comments from U.S. economists after the Labor Department reported that November non-farm payrolls rose by 118,000 against a revised 224,000 in the previous month. Experts had expected payrolls to advance by 179,000 in November.</p>
<p>AUDREY FREEDMAN, AUDREY FREEDMAN &amp; ASSOCIATES, NEW YORK: &quot;It suggests to me moderate growth...this is still growth however. It also suggests that retailing isn't for sure. There was earlier growth in retail payrolls which is one reason why right now they're not growing.&quot;  </p>
<p>ALAN RUSKIN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, I.D.E.A. INC: &quot;The weakness in retail employment explains a large part of the weakness. We only got 17,000 new jobs in the retail sector because of the late Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>&quot;The household survey generally is also weak because the unemployment rate jumped to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Hourly earnings jumped nine cents. They'll try to explain that away saying it's erratic, but it won't be easy. There is an increase in terms of wage pressures. There are some signs of the economy slowing down but also some material signs of wage pressures as well.&quot;  </p>
<p>MICHAEL NIEMIRA, ECONOMIST, BANK OF TOKYO-MITSUBISHI LTD: &quot;It certainly is on the softer side but you did get a pickup in hours and the concern may be the large increase in average hourly earnings,&quot; he said. &quot;What we may be seeing is kind of a late cycle phenonemon where employment starts to slow and wages start to pickup a little and ultimately could be bad news down the road.&quot;</p>
<p>He added, &quot;The other alarming thing is the softness is confirmed on both the household and payrolls side. When we've had some weak numbers two months ago the payrolls number was weak but the household number was up big time.&quot;  </p>
<p>DAN SETO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, NIKKO SECURITIES CO INTERNATIONAL INC: &quot;The 5.4 percent unemployment rate should provide some comfort to people concerned about tight labor markets. But that provides only very little comfort because we had an average hourly earnings rise of 0.8 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not sure what this means yet. This is a big number after a 0.1 percent decline (in October). We think there is some wage inflation. We don't think it's a 0.8 percent pace per month, but it's certainly some degree of acceleration.</p>
<p>&quot;A decline in government jobs during an election year is unexpected.&quot;  </p>
<p>IRWIN KELLNER, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT CHASE REGIONAL BANK: &quot;The bond market is needlessly worried that the employment figures would be too strong and combined with the earlier drop in productivity figured we were off and running as far as labor costs are concerned. But no way does this suggest anything remotely resembling that scenario.</p>
<p>&quot;Its another example of how the economy has slowed down dramatically; 118,000 jobs is the weakest in recent memory and the fact is that most of the jobs that were created were service jobs and retail jobs, most of which were lower paying.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;But the fact that you did have 9,000 factory jobs, compared with a decline the previous month, that was one reason why average earnings popped up.</p>
<p>&quot;So on balance this is a very positive number for the bond markets but yet the stock markets shouldn't run for cover because this does not by any means suggest the economy has slowed down to the point of recession.&quot;  </p>
<p>ASTRID ADOLFSON, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MCM MONEYWATCH: &quot;(The payroll number) is moderate, and I think you have to be careful with it ... There were problems because of the late Thanksgiving so retail jobs may be understated, construction might have been understated also because of the weather, and hourly earnings that are off, and labor says its probably not minimum wage. It continues to be an uneven pattern.&quot;</p>
