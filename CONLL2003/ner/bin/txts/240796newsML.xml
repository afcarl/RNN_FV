<title>USA: Unemployment rises to 5.4 percent in November.</title>

<p>The unemployment rate edged higher in November as the U.S. economy pumped out new jobs at a slower pace, the Labor Department said on Friday.</p>
<p>The department, in the government's first assessment of the economy's vitality in November, said unemployment rose to 5.4 percent in the month as some 118,000 new jobs were created.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate had been 5.2 percent in October and the economy had created a revised 224,000 jobs, previously reported as 210,000, the department said.  </p>
<p>Wall Street economists surveyed by Reuters had projected the November unemployment rate would remain unchanged and that some 179,000 jobs would be produced.</p>
<p>Average hourly earnings by workers, closely watched for clues on wage inflation, which can affect prices that companies charge, rose nine cents an hour, after being down a revised one cent an hour in October, previously reported as unchanged.</p>
<p>The report seemed to give additional weight to the view that the economy of late has been chugging along at a slowing pace with few signs that inflation is becoming a problem.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book summary of national economic activity, released Wednesday, appeared to suggest that slow but steady expansion, rather than an acceleration, lies ahead, with little need for interest-rate rises to dampen inflation risks.</p>
<p>The Fed's powerful policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets later this month to decide the future course of interest rates.</p>
<p>The department said job creation during the month reflected gains, some of them modest, across the board with the exception of government work, which showed a decline.</p>
<p>The workweek rose by 0.2 hours last month to 34.5, while overtime increased by 0.1 hours to 4.5 hours.</p>
<p>Goods-producing industries created 22,000 jobs, while the government cut jobs by an identical amount.</p>
<p>The largest gains were in the services area, which rose by 96,000, while construction added 14,000, and manufacturing added 9,000.</p>
