U.S. stocks were expected to tumble at the open after a warning by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan against "irrational exuberance" in stocks and other assets staggered financial markets around the globe.

Greenspan, who made the comment during a lecture in Washington Thursday night, stopped short of directly referring to the recent sharp rally in stocks but analysts expressed little doubt about the impact of his message.

"It doesn't look good," said Hildegard Zagorski, market analyst at Prudential Securities.
