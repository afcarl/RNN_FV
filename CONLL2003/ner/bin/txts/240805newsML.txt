U.S. Equisure signs two reinsurance contracts.

MINNEAPOLIS 1996-12-05

Equisure Inc said on Thursday it had signed two new reinsurance contracts that will bring in about $19.5 million in annual premiums.

Equisure did not name the two firms but said one was a U.S.-based, A-rated admitted carrier involved in insurance liability. The second company is a U.K. insurer.

It said it expects the fourth quarter ending December 31, 1996, will start to reflect the impact of the new contracts.

Equisure, based in Minneapolis and Antwerp, Belgium, is a reinsurance company that primarily covers risks in delivery and warehousing of raw, refined or constructed metal products.
