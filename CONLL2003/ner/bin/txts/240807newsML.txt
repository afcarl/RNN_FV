Bell Atlantic and Nynex slow TV expansion - WSJ.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Bell Atlantic and Nynex, which announced a merger last year, are retreating from a key part of their strategy to expand into television, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

The decision makes it almost certain that they will reorganize their ambitious programming venture, Tele-TV, either shutting it or folding it into Bell Atlantic.

Bell Atlantic and Nynex had intended to offer Tele-TV to tens of thousands of East Coast telephone customers, using a microwave transmission technology called wireless cable.

But, the story says, the technology has proven to be fatally flawed because the signals are obstructed by hills, trees and structures.
