UPS mechanics ratify new labour deal.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. 1996-12-06

Top-scale aircraft mechanics at United Parcel Service have ratified a new six-year labour contract which will provide them with wage increases of three percent a year for each year of the agreement retroactive to August 1, 1995, industry sources said.

The agreement, which runs until August 1, 2001, covers 800 mechanics and utility workers, members of Teamsters Union Local 2727.

It will also take more junior employees less time to get to the top of the pay scale: five years instead of either 10 or seven under the old agreement, the sources said.

Employees also will be able to earn an improved "perfect attendance" bonus, they added.

The union has gained jurisdiction for maintenance work performed on company aircraft in Hawaii and Puerto Rico if maintenance operations are established at airports in those locations, and union members will maintain aircraft used in the freight carrier's planned weekend passenger charter operations.
