Schwarzkopf doubts chemicals made vets sick - NYT.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of American troops in the 1991 Gulf War, said he did not believe that Iraqi chemical weapons had anything to do with the mysterious health problems reported by thousands of those troops, The New York Times reported on Friday.

In what the Times called the first detailed interview on the subject since the Pentagon's announcement this year that thousands of troops might have been exposed to nerve gas after the destruction of an Iraqi ammunition depot, the retired general said he did not recall any confirmed reports during the war that U.S. troops had been exposed to Iraqi chemical or biological weapons.

"We had lots of alarms, but I personally know of no incident in which there was any chemical uncovered," Schwarzkopf told the Times.

Schwarzkopf said he did not know why several pages were missing from a military log that should have recorded reports of chemical or biological detections during the war, the Times said.

Pentagon officials said on Wednesday that despite an exhaustive search they had been unable to track down the missing entries from computer disks that had once contained the chemical warfare logs.

"I more than anybody else wish to hell we could find the logs," the general is quoted as saying.
