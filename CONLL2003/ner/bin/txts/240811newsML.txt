U.S. astronauts to try landing later Friday morning.

NASA ordered the astronauts aboard the space shuttle Columbia to skip their first possible landing attempt on Friday morning because of bad weather at the Florida landing site.

Eileen Hawley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. space agency, said a combination of patches of fog at the landing strip and scattered clouds made the planned 8:01 a.m. EST (1301 GMT) touchdown unsafe.  If the weather clears in time, the astronauts will have a second landing opportunity on Friday at 9:38 a.m. EST (1438 EST).  

The shuttle's back-up landing strip at Edwards Air Force Base in California was ruled out for Friday because of gusty winds.

Cloudy skies thwarted the shuttle's planned landing on Thursday. The crew was minutes away from firing Columbia's braking rockets to begin their descent when flight controllers called off the planned 8:10 a.m. EST (1310 GMT) landing.

The weather in Florida had been expected to improve on Friday, contrary to a forecast earlier in the week that had caused NASA to order the shuttle home one day earlier than planned. But the extra day in space made Columbia's voyage the second-longest shuttle flight ever.

The mission, which began Nov. 19, was marred by a jammed airlock hatch that forced NASA to cancel a pair of spacewalks. Astronauts Tammy Jernigan and Tom Jones spent months training for the spacewalks, which had been intended to test construction tools for a planned permanent space station.
