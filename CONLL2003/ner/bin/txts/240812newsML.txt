The U.S. and California governments said Thursday they have given a Texas company lists of assets they are offering to swap in a proposed $380 million deal to acquire two ancient redwood groves.

Officials said it was an important step in government efforts to acquire and preserve northern California's Headwaters grove, the world's largest privately-owned old-growth redwood forest.

The U.S. and California governments reached a tentative agreement Sept. 28 with Charles Hurwitz, chairman of MAXXAM Inc, which owns Headwaters, to preserve the 3,000-acre (1,210 hectare) grove as well as the nearby 425-acre (170 hectare) Elkhead Springs grove and a buffer zone of surrounding timberland.

The groves, about 250 miles (400 kms) north of San Francisco, contain towering redwoods, some of which are hundreds or even thousands of years old.

The parties agreed that during the following 10 months, they would identify $380 million in government assets to be swapped for the forests, $250 million of them from the federal government and $130 million from the state.

The Interior Department said the federal assets submitted to MAXXAM in the proposed exchange included 2,967 acres (1,200 hectares) of non-old-growth timber land in northern California, federal oil and gas interests in California, about 30 acres (12 hectares) of land in Laguna Niguel in southern California and the 7,755-acre (3,140 hectare) Elk River timber property next to Headwaters Forest.

The state of California sent Hurwitz a list of surplus properties estimated to be worth more than $200 million.

The value of specific properties on the California list will be appraised, Hurwitz will select the properties he is interested in and "hopefully what he wants will amount to approximately $130 million," California Deputy Secretary for Resources Andy McLeod said.

California is offering MAXXAM the choice of a wide variety of assets including office buildings, warehouses, a rock quarry and the Transbay terminal, a bus terminal in San Francisco covering three city blocks.

"If anybody doubts the seriousness of our desire to protect these natural resources, they can look at the magnitude and extent of the assets we are willing to put on the table," McLeod said.

MAXXAM and the state of California now have 10 days to agree on an appraisal process and then another 30 days to decide which properties are suitable for exchange, state officials said.

A MAXXAM spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

Environmentalists were disappointed with September's tentative agreement. They have pushed for years for the protection of a 60,000 acre (24,280 hectare) preserve, including Headwaters, five smaller ancient redwood groves and surrounding forest to safeguard the entire ecosystem.

Hundreds of environmental activists have been arrested this year during many protests calling for the protection of the redwood forests.
