<p>Astronauts aboard the Columbia wrapped up one of the space agency's longest shuttle missions on Friday and prepared to dodge scattered clouds at NASA's Florida landing site.</p>
<p>Ground controllers said patchy fog and clouds from a cold front moving through central Florida could delay the shuttle's first landing opportunity on Friday, set for 8:01 a.m. EST (1301 GMT).</p>
<p>Columbia would have a second chance to land at Kennedy Space Centre at 9:38 a.m. EST (1438 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;The passage of that cold front through the Kennedy Space Centre area might be a little slower than expected,&quot; said NASA spokesman Rob Navias. &quot;Patchy ground fog forecast for the early morning hours at Kennedy Space Centre might be a bit thicker than first believed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The scenario could play out that the second of the two landing opportunities might be better as the sun comes out and has a chance to burn off the fog,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The shuttle's back-up landing strip at Edwards Air Force Base in California was ruled out for Friday because of gusty winds.</p>
<p>Cloudy skies thwarted the shuttle's planned landing on Thursday. The crew was just minutes away from firing Columbia's braking rockets to begin their descent when flight controllers called off the planned 8:10 a.m. EST (1310 GMT) landing.</p>
<p>&quot;Give me another day up here and I'll take every second of it,&quot; said veteran astronaut Story Musgrave, who is making his sixth and final shuttle flight. At 61, Musgrave has been with NASA for three decades and is the oldest person to fly in space.</p>
<p>The astronauts were awakened at 9:26 p.m. EST (0226 GMT) on Thursday evening to begin stowing gear and making other landing preparations. The crew was to close the shuttle's cargo bay doors at 4:15 a.m. EST (0915 GMT) on Friday, then fire braking rockets at 6:55 a.m. EST (1155 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning, Columbia. It's flight day 17 and we're ready to bring you home,&quot; said ground controller Marc Garneau after playing an audiocassette of &quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot; to wake up the crew.</p>
<p>The weather in Florida was expected to improve on Friday, contrary to an earlier forecast that had caused NASA to order the shuttle home one day earlier than planned.</p>
<p>The extra day in space made Columbia's voyage the second longest shuttle flight ever.</p>
<p>The mission, which began on Nov. 19, was marred by a jammed airlock hatch that forced NASA to cancel a pair of space walks. Astronauts Tammy Jernigan and Tom Jones spent months training for the spacewalks, which had been intended to test construction tools for the planned permanent space station.</p>
<p>Another problem cropped up this week when a crucial navigation tool stopped working. The shuttle is equipped with two other back-up inertial measurement units to guide it home.</p>
<p>The astronauts released and later retrieved two science satellites. A U.S.-German telescope studied the life cycles of stars and a prototype computer chip factory manufactured ultra-pure semiconductors for the electronics industry.</p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration prefers to land the shuttle whenever possible at its Florida base to avoid the additional $1 million cost of transporting the shuttle back from California.</p>
