Einstein's heirs settle lawsuit over letters.

SAN FRANCISCO 1996-12-05

Heirs of Albert Einstein announced on Thursday they had settled a dispute over rights to a trust overseeing letters written by the great physicist.

Lawyers said at a hearing in an Oakland, California court that a settlement had been reached of a suit filed last year by Einstein's granddaughter, Evelyn, against the trustees of an archive which originally consisted of some 450 of Einstein's letters.

As a result of the lawsuit, some of the letters, which gave a revealing look at Einstein's personal life, were sold by Christie's in New York last week for nearly $900,000. But not all of the letters sold and prices paid were not as high as originally expected.

Ken Cera, an attorney for Evelyn Einstein, said the seven beneficiaries of the trust were all represented at Thursday's hearing in Alameda County Superior Court. "The parties agreed on a final division of assets," Cera said after the hearing.

Judge William McKinstry approved a request by lawyers involved in the case to keep the terms of the settlement, which involves family members in California, Switzerland and Israel, confidential.

The out-of-court settlement avoids a trial of the suit that had been due to begin soon. The lawyers return to court on Dec. 13, when McKinstry is expected to formally approve the settlement.

In the suit, Evelyn Einstein sought a share of the archive of letters by the Nobel prize-winning author of the revolutionary theory of relativity. She alleged that trustees had concealed from her that she was a beneficiary. The suit estimated that the assets of the trust were worth some $15 million.

Evelyn Einstein, 55, who lives in Albany near San Francisco, is poor, disabled and in bad health, and needed money for medical treatment, the lawsuit said.

She wanted the letters sold so she could receive a share of the proceeds. She also originally demanded $5 million in punitive damages from the trustees.
