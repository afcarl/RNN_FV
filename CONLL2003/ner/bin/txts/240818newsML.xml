<title>USA: Einstein's heirs settle lawsuit over letters.</title>
<headline>Einstein's heirs settle lawsuit over letters.</headline>
<dateline>SAN FRANCISCO 1996-12-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Heirs of Albert Einstein announced on Thursday they had settled a dispute over rights to a trust overseeing letters written by the great physicist.</p>
<p>Lawyers said at a hearing in an Oakland, California court that a settlement had been reached of a suit filed last year by Einstein's granddaughter, Evelyn, against the trustees of an archive which originally consisted of some 450 of Einstein's letters.</p>
<p>As a result of the lawsuit, some of the letters, which gave a revealing look at Einstein's personal life, were sold by Christie's in New York last week for nearly $900,000. But not all of the letters sold and prices paid were not as high as originally expected.</p>
<p>Ken Cera, an attorney for Evelyn Einstein, said the seven beneficiaries of the trust were all represented at Thursday's hearing in Alameda County Superior Court. &quot;The parties agreed on a final division of assets,&quot; Cera said after the hearing.</p>
<p>Judge William McKinstry approved a request by lawyers involved in the case to keep the terms of the settlement, which involves family members in California, Switzerland and Israel, confidential.</p>
<p>The out-of-court settlement avoids a trial of the suit that had been due to begin soon. The lawyers return to court on Dec. 13, when McKinstry is expected to formally approve the settlement.</p>
<p>In the suit, Evelyn Einstein sought a share of the archive of letters by the Nobel prize-winning author of the revolutionary theory of relativity. She alleged that trustees had concealed from her that she was a beneficiary. The suit estimated that the assets of the trust were worth some $15 million.</p>
<p>Evelyn Einstein, 55, who lives in Albany near San Francisco, is poor, disabled and in bad health, and needed money for medical treatment, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>She wanted the letters sold so she could receive a share of the proceeds. She also originally demanded $5 million in punitive damages from the trustees.</p>
