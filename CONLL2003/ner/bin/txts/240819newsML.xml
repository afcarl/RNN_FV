<p>Large banks could become the dominant banking organizations in most rural counties under nationwide branch banking, Vice President Alton Gilbert of the St Louis Federal Reserve Bank said Thursday.</p>
<p>Federal law will allow interstate branch banking next year.</p>
<p>Speaking at a banking conference, Gilbert said it was unclear whether such a change in the rural banking structure would help or hurt rural economic activity. Local banks could argue for regulatory relief to make it easier for them to provide credit to residents not served by the big banks.</p>
<p>Gilbert based his conclusions on a study of the outcome of statewide branch banking laws in 12 states. In California, for example, the five largest banks had offices in 16 of 18 rural counties and together held more than half of the deposits in every one.</p>
<p>The executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of America, Kenneth Guenther, welcomed the idea of a smaller regulatory burden. The IBAA is a trade group for community banks.  </p>
<p>Local banks will be put at a disadvantage by nationwide branch banking, he said, because they must obey the Community Reinvestment Act, a series of initiatives to promote local lending, while a branch bank would not have the obligation.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an unfair situation that must be remedied, particularly as regards out-of-state branches of banks operating in many states,&quot; Guenther said.</p>
<p>Thomas Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, told the conference rural America &quot;is enjoying an economic rebound in the 1990s&quot; although the gains were spread unevenly. The need for capital would be increased, he said, by reductions in federal subsidies.</p>
<p>One-fourth of Americans live in rural areas. The rural population is rising overall and job growth is robust.</p>
<p>Computer links and modern telecommunications allow &quot;footloose&quot; firms the option of basing high-paying jobs virtually anywhere -- an unparalleled opportunity for rural America, said Marvin Duncan, a North Dakota State University professor.</p>
<p>But Duncan and other speakers said rural lenders face constraints as well.  </p>
<p>Rural banks tend to be small -- less than $100 million in assets -- and in the midst of a wave of consolidation. Many of their depositors and local property owners are elderly, posing the chance that ownership of billions of dollars in assets will transfer in the next decade to baby boomers living in the city for use in stocks and mutual funds.</p>
