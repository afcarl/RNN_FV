Far from Argentine woes, Menem basks in the U.S.

Argentine President Carlos Menem, a long way from political woes at home, on Thursday took time to bask in his cosy relationship with the United States and in the praise from international investors.

Menem, who has seen his approval rating plummet to single digits in recent opinion polls, stepped out beaming from a private meeting in the Oval Office with President Bill Clinton.

"It was a meeting of two presidents, but moreover, of two friends. Frequently, friendship can overcome things that hamper a relationship," Menem told reporters at the White House.

Argentina has become a fast ally of Washington since Menem took office in 1989, siding with U.S. presidents in the Gulf war, the Haiti intervention, various peacekeeping missions and in lambasting Cuba's communist leader, Fidel Castro.

In a statement released after the talks, the White House said that it viewed Argentina as one of its closest international partners. It added that Menem had invited Clinton to visit Argentina, pointing out that the U.S. leader wanted to make a trip to Latin America early in his second term.

The Peronist president told reporters that he had asked for Clinton's help to try to persuade Britain to hold talks with Argentina over the sovereignty of the Falkland islands.

The Argentines have maintained their long-standing claims over the South Altantic archipelago despite having lost a war against Britain over that territory in 1982.

Asked what the hoarse Clinton had replied to his request regarding the Falklands, which Argentina calls the Malvinas, Menem said: "well, he nodded."

Under former president Ronald Reagan, Washington stood by its NATO ally Britain during the brief, bloody 1982 war.

Besides their warm political ties, the United States and Argentina also have a number of pending trade disputes.

Menem said the Argentine Congress would soon pass a "data exclusivity" law strengthening the protection for foreign intellectual property rights, hoping to settle a simmering dispute with U.S. pharmaceutical companies.

He added that Clinton had instructed aides to clear the way for Argentine beef exports to enter the U.S. market, from which certain cuts had been excluded due to sanitary barriers against the foot-and-mouth disease.

According to an Argentine diplomat, Menem was particularly pleased that his White House host had not raised the issue of corruption during their talks.

The Argentine government was concerned about the impact of accusations hurled this week by Menem's estranged economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, the architect of a stabilisation programme that tamed Argentina's hyperinflation.

A revered figure in world financial markets, Cavallo, who was sacked in July, charged that foreign investors were worried about bribery and court cover-ups in Argentina.

"There is a firm will to investigate any charges that are made. And Argentine courts are working capably and swiftly to put an end to all this," Menem said.

As he did Wednesday when he courted bankers and investors in New York, Menem drew applause from the businessmen for his achievements like the massive privatisations of state firms and for his forecasts of stronger economic growth.
