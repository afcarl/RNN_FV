FEATURE-Bela Fleck revitalizes popularity of banjo.

Bela Fleck admits that New York City is an unlikely place to fall in love with the banjo.

"But then again, I don't play like I come from North Carolina," said the 37-year-old Fleck, whose masterful banjo strumming has revitalised the instrument's popularity.

The native New Yorker was named after the famous Hungarian composer Bela Bartok by his father, a classical music lover. But Fleck's parents split when he was a year old and his earliest musical experiences date back to playing folk guitar with his mother. At age 7, his life changed forever when he was visiting his grandparents and heard the theme song to the popular television comedy, "The Beverly Hillbillies," which featured banjo strumming by bluegrass legend Earl Scruggs.

"I was into guitar in a vague sort of way, but then I heard the banjo and it was a totally different thing," he told Reuters. "I heard that sound come over the television and it was the prettiest sound I ever heard. I was flipped out and everything else took second place. It was like turning on a switch in me."

Armed with his love for the banjo and a fascination with jazz, Fleck went to New York's High School of Music and Art and followed his dream, hooking up with musicians in New York and then Boston who were seeking to blend traditional bluegrass music with jazz, rock and other modern sounds.

PLAYING ORNETTE COLEMAN BLUEGRASS STYLE

"I was able to take lessons from good people who were doing new and crazy things. They were mixing it all up. They wanted to play Ornette Coleman bluegrass style," Fleck recalled. "I got into modernists and it took me a while to get into traditionalists, but then I moved to Kentucky for a while to get closer to the bluegrass heartlands."

After Kentucky, Fleck moved to Nashville, where he has lived for the past 15 years. In 1982 he joined the New Grass Revival, making a name for himself as a daring banjo player with this eclectic ensemble that stretched bluegrass music beyond its traditional boundaries.

In 1990, the 10-time Grammy nominee formed Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, which includes bassist Victor Wooten and his brother Roy "Future Man" Wooten on a guitar-shaped drum synthesizer he invented called the drumitar. The trio colourfully fused bluegrass, jazz, rock, funk, Celtic, Latin, classical, world beat, reggae and blues into a unique sound that has been drawing critical and popular success. They average about 200 performances a year, recently touring with Sting and Hootie & the Blowfish.

While Fleck is often credited with redefining the banjo, he is also considered a renegade by the country music industry in Nashville. "I don't have a heck of a lot to do with the Nashville country music industry," he said.

The current explosion in country music began in 1991 and has seen record sales multiply with increased radio television exposure and as country music has evolved by absorbing rock styles to capture young and other new audiences.

FINDS PLACE FOR BANJO

"Bluegrass is like the illegitimate stepchild of country music, and since country music is trying to transform itself into something different it really shuns the banjo," Fleck said. Nevertheless, he is recognised for helping Nashville in his unique way. "A lot of people in the national music industry are very proud that a banjo player from Nasvhille can end up competing for national spots on TV," he said.

Banjo manufacturers are also grateful to Fleck. Greg Deering and his wife Janet started up Deering Banjo Company near San Diego in 1978 and say sales are up significantly. "A year ago, we weren't back ordered at all and now we're back-ordered about 20 percent;" said Janet Deering. The company's banjos retail for between $1,000 and $12,000 each.

"I think the banjo is growing more popular because instead of being pigeonholed with a hee-haw image people are considering it a full-on instrument for jazz, rock and other forms of music," Deering said.

Fleck's fifth album, just-released "Live Art," brings all of the artist's various sounds together, featuring original jazzy sounds, old New Grass Revival tunes, a cover of the Beatles' "Oh Darling" tune  and one tune that mixes a Bach sonata with "The Ballad of Jed Clampett," an instrumental that Fleck recorded for "The Beverly Hillbillies" movie.
