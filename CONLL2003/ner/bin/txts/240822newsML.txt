U.S West Coast late crudes rise further with NYMEX.

LOS ANGELES 1996-12-05

U.S. West Coast crudes rose further in the afternoon, driven by bullish crude futures and an increase in California posted prices.

Spot prices for Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude, which is pegged off West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, were lifted by the futures contract, which jumped 78 cents to $25.58 a barrel.

The rally pushed crude through key technical levels and was sparked by data showing lower inventories and increased demand in Asia.  

West Coast spot trade thinned Thursday after a flurry of early-week deals lowered the discount for ANS.

Three deals early this week narrowed the discount for Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude to $1.75 a barrel under WTI from $1.95.

Traders attributed the increase to shortness in ANS supplies. They said tightness could worsen after the expiration of crude supply contract between Arco and Tosco January 1. The contract gave Tosco 50,000 bpd of ANS, which often landed in the spot market.

Dealers said a tender of Chilean Rincon crude closed Thursday. The grade has a gravity of 36 degrees API.

Diffs for Line 63 remained unchanged at $3.20/3.00 under WTI.

Prices for Kern River heavy crude remained 10 cents under postings to even with postings, traders said. Outright prices increased 20 cents to $17.40/17.60 a barrel after Chevron raised its posted prices 75 cents Thursday.

Wilmington premiums stagnated at 55 to 65 cents over postings, with outright pirces $18.90/19.00 a barrel and no barrels sold.
