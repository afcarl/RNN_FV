U.S. West Coast spot gasoline keeps firming late.

LOS ANGELES 1996-12-05

U.S. West Coast wholesale gasoline continued climbing late Thursday, as refiners snatched up supplies before pricier crude values trickled into the spot market.

A 78-cent rally in NYMEX crude, which influences the wholesale market, forced traders to buy products in a market nervous about decreased production and upcoming maintenance outages.

"People looked at (Thursday's) values and said it's way undervalued," a broker said.  

NYMEX January crude settled at $25.58, up 78 cents as it broke through a contract high of $25.20 a barrel and gained strength on reports of shrinking U.S. supplies.

Bids for Los Angeles conventional-grade gasoline added another cent to their penny gain this morning, touching 67.50/67.50 cents a gallon. Futures helped fuel the gains as January gasoline prices settled a sharp 1.44 cents higher at 69.68 cents a gallon.

California Air Resource Board (CARB) gasoline was sold for 70.50 and 70 cents, with traders pegging its range at 70/70.50 cents in late trade. It gained one cent from midday and just over two cents from Wednesday.

Distillates, which have also risen this week amid increased exports, saw less dramatic gains. Bids for L.A. low sulphur diesel rose a half cent to 70 cents.
