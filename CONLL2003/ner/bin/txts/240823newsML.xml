<p>U.S. West Coast wholesale gasoline continued climbing late Thursday, as refiners snatched up supplies before pricier crude values trickled into the spot market.</p>
<p>A 78-cent rally in NYMEX crude, which influences the wholesale market, forced traders to buy products in a market nervous about decreased production and upcoming maintenance outages.</p>
<p>&quot;People looked at (Thursday's) values and said it's way undervalued,&quot; a broker said.  </p>
<p>NYMEX January crude settled at $25.58, up 78 cents as it broke through a contract high of $25.20 a barrel and gained strength on reports of shrinking U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Bids for Los Angeles conventional-grade gasoline added another cent to their penny gain this morning, touching 67.50/67.50 cents a gallon. Futures helped fuel the gains as January gasoline prices settled a sharp 1.44 cents higher at 69.68 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>California Air Resource Board (CARB) gasoline was sold for 70.50 and 70 cents, with traders pegging its range at 70/70.50 cents in late trade. It gained one cent from midday and just over two cents from Wednesday.</p>
<p>Distillates, which have also risen this week amid increased exports, saw less dramatic gains. Bids for L.A. low sulphur diesel rose a half cent to 70 cents.</p>
