Amoco gets Bolivian oil & gas unit.

NEW YORK 1996-12-05

Amoco Corp said on Thursday it had won operatorship and 50 percent ownership in a new Bolivian oil and gas company with a bid of $306,667,001.

The company, Empresa Petrolera Chaco, was formed in the capitalisation of Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Boliviano (YPFB), the Bolivian state oil company, Amoco said.

The company said that Chaco, one of three Bolivian entities offered for bid this week, has proved hydrocarbon reserves of 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas and 35 million barrels of oil.

It currently produces about 180 million cubic feet of gas per day, which is sold into the market or reinjected into the fields to maintain production.

It also produces about 9,300 barrels of crude oil and condensate per day.

Amoco said it believes the hydrocarbon reserves and the quantities of oil, gas and liquids produced can be increased significantly with the planned investments.

Amoco said it and the Bolivian government expect to finalise details of the contracts within 60 to 90 days, at which time Amoco will formally assume operatorship of the company.  

One of the company's primary objectives will be to develop additional gas resources to supply the Bolivia to Brazil pipeline, which is expected to begin operations in 1999, it said.

The Chaco producing properties include fields in the Santa Cruz Basin and the Tarija Basin, as well as additional exploration acreage.
