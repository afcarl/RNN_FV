U.S. issues travel warning for Central African Rep.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-05

The U.S. State Department Thursday warned all Americans to defer travel to the Central African Republic because of civil and military unrest.

"The security situation remains uncertain," the department said in a written notice.

The warning, issued to reflect "deteriorating" conditions, would remain in effect until further notice, it said.

An uprising by army mutineers complaining about pay and conditions has paralysed the capital, Bangui, for almost three weeks and has begun to degenerate into an ethnic conflict.

The rebels have hardened their demands into a drive to topple President Ange-Felix Patasse and to disarm civilian militias and mercenaries from Chad and Sudan they say are hired by the head of state.
