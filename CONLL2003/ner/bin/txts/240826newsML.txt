Film director Woody Allen lost another round in his bitter custody battle with former lover actress Mia Farrow on Thursday when a state judge barred him from visiting his adopted daughter, Dylan.

But Allen will be allowed to resume visits to Satchel, his son with Farrow, in one week, Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Elliot Wilk said in his 10 page opinion.

In reaching his decision, Wilk relied on the testimony of psychiatric experts who he said testified at a closed door hearing last summer that Satchel, now known as Seamus, hated his father and that Dylan had no desire of ever seeing him.

The experts have been treating the two children for a number of years.

In denying Allen's request to visit 11-year-old Dylan, who now goes by the name Eliza, the judge said her therapeutic situation was "still too fragile" to determine when or if contact should be resumed.

Allen's attorney, Elkan Abromowitz told Reuters he would seek an expedited appeal as soon as possible.

Allen and Farrow who were never married, split up in January 1992 after 13 years together when Farrow found nude pictures of her grown adopted daughter Soon-Yi Farrow Previn in Allen's apartment.  Allen and Previn were later revealed to be romantically linked.

Dr. Hector Bird who treated Dylan until the summer of 1995 told the judge that Dylan "remains adamant in her negative feelings towards Mr. Allen" and expresses no desire to see him.

Bird said he believes Dylan avoids her father because of her "perception of her father having, as she referred to it 'a boyfriend-girlfriend' relationship, with her sister..."

Allen has not seen the girl since 1992 when Farrow accused him of sexually molesting Dylan. The director steadfastly denied the charge and medical experts found no evidence of abuse and cleared him.

In June 1993, Wilk awarded Farrow custody of the girl, Satchel and another adopted son, Moses, now 18 after a month-long acrimonious trial in which he denounced Allen for having an affair with Previn.
