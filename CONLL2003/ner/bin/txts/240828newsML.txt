U.S. says rebels agree to atrocity probe.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-05

Tutsi rebels have agreed to let independent observers investigate allegations of atrocities against civilians in eastern Zaire, the U.S. State Department said on Thursday.

"The rebels have now agreed to allow access to human rights investigators to eastern Zaire, and the rebels have offered assurances that they are committed to cooperating with an international investigation of these political killings," spokesman Nicholas Burns said.

He said this message was communicated to the acting deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Kinshasa, who met rebel leader Laurent Kabila on Wednesday.

"Actions will always be more important than promises but we perhaps have made ... progress on this very important issue," Burns told a news briefing.

The United States this week voiced concern over "mounting evidence" of abuses of civilians by Tutsi rebel fighters known as the Banyamulange in eastern Zaire.

Burns talked publicly of consistent reports by refugees repatriating to Rwanda of killings by rebel forces in northern Zaire and rumours of executions of Zairian government officials in Bukavu.

He urged rebel leaders to halt the abuses and allow independent observers to investigate. The international community would ensure violators were brought to justice, he added.

Rebel leaders have been taking towns as part of an intensive offensive in the eastern region that could be a serious blow to the government of Zaire.
