China's Defense Minister Chi Haotian and U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry will meet Monday for talks that Washington hopes will help stabilize relations and address tough issues, officials said Friday.

Chi and a delegation of 20 Chinese defense and foreign ministries officials were scheduled to arrive in New York Thursday and will meet with U.S. officials Monday and Tuesday.

A senior U.S. defense official told reporters that Perry is likely to tell Chi Washington believes Chinese military sales to Iran could eventually help disrupt Middle East oil supplies not only to Europe but Asia.

"We believe certain actions that China has engaged in in terms of provision of certain kinds of equipment to Iran is not in our interests but we also believe not in their interest as well," he said.

He said other major topics will be U.S.-China cooperation toward resolving tensions between North and South Korea, and other Asia-Pacific security issues.

The U.S. official made the comments at a briefing on condition that he not be identified.

Defense Department spokesman Ken Bacon stressed earlier that Chi's visit is part of an effort by both countries to maintain stable relations even though they have disagreements.

"This is a significant visit," Bacon said. "...We believe that one of the keys to a more stable world is having a robust dialogue with all countries, and China is a leading country with whom we want to have a full and frank dialogue.

"We know we won't agree on all topics. We don't agree on all topics," Bacon said. "But altogether, we think that we have a better chance of maintaining the type of stability we have achieved in Asia through a full dialogue with China, and that's what we'll be working on with Minister Chi's visit."

Chi and his delegation will meet with senior White House and State Department officials Monday and Tuesday as well Perry, Gen. John Shalikashvili, who is chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and other defense officials.

He will also make a speech on Chinese security policy and meet with reporters, the defense briefer said.

The Chinese delegation will be in the United States for two weeks and also is to visit U.S. military installations in Virginia, Alabama and Texas.
