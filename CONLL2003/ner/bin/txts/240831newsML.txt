Restructuring NYC and NY could save $15 bln -study.

New York State and New York City could save as much as $15 billion a year if they restructured a vast array of programs, from welfare to public education, and streamlined how they ran the government, a study said.

Such sweeping changes would free up $9 billion to $11 billion that the state and its largest city could use to pay for badly needed capital improvements and tax cuts needed to compete with other regions whose costs are lower, said the report, prepared by the Citizens Budget Commission.

The extra funds also could help close large, long-term budget gaps faced by both the city and state, as well as provide government employees with incentive pay.

The group, a non-profit civic organization, was careful to note that it was not addressing whether its proposals were practical. Among its recommendations were for the state to take over the $3.6 billion cost of social welfare programs now paid by local governments.

"Our goal is to help change the way people think about state and local government," said the group's president, Raymond Horton, in prepared remarks.

Both Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said they backed a number of the group's recommendations. Still, the mayor did not seem optimistic about the likelihood that the proposals would be adopted any time soon.

"The reality of the plan is not as strong as the academic (science). You would not get the budget balanced in the plan," Giuliani said through a spokeswoman. The mayor noted that the state government has resisted taking over the costs of Medicaid, which helps pay for health care for the poor.

Similarly, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said the proposals were likely to encounter considerable opposition. "Citizens Budget Commission poses some hard choices that will be difficult for many to accept," McCall said in prepared remarks.

New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, through a spokeswoman, said his office had not yet analyzed whether the group's recommendations were practical. Still, the plan is likely to stimulate public debate, which is particularly useful in an election year, he said. Giuliani faces re-election next year.

The wide-ranging study pulls together a number of ideas that have been proposed over the years and recommends sacrifices by unions, state workers, private companies and the wealthy. "Everybody who gets government services is being asked to give up a little," said Bob Kurtter, a vice president of Moody's Investors Service.

Pataki said that the recommendations support the direction his administration has taken in the past two years to improve the state's competitiveness.

"The report endorses our philosophy of controlling government spending, providing tax relief for working families and creating an atmosphere that is conducive to private sector job growth," he said in prepared remarks.

His statement did not address whether the state might be willing to pick up all of the tab for social welfare programs.
