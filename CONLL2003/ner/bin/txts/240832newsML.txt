Highlights of report on restructuring NY and NYC.

NEW YORK 1996-12-05

The following list highlights some of the Citizen Budget Commission's recommendations and findings on restructuring New York and New York City.

The non-profit civic group said its proposals could save up to $15 billion a year.

--Expanding managed care, as Medicaid costs for acute care cost 58 percent more than the national average per patient.

--Curtailing the placing of foster children with relatives.

--Tightening eligibility rules for Medicaid to force the middle- and upper-class to pay a fairer share, and providing incentives to help people buy long-term health insurance.

--Cutting non-cash public aid to bring it in line with the rest of the country, while adjusting for the cost of living.

--Cutting state aid to wealthier school districts by 20 percent, saving $400 million a year, while allowing districts that did not want to slash spending to raise property taxes.

--Repealing the Wicks Law that requires localities to divide capital contracts whose cost exceeds $50,000 into at least 4 separate contracts, a move that could have saved the city about $720 million in capital costs in 1995.

--Improving regular maintenance plans to avoid costly upgrades later on.

--Setting clear priorities and eliminating items like state-run golf courses.

--Using competitive contracting, which would be open to state workers.

--Raising the government workforce's productivity by condolidating agencies and revamping union pacts and work rules. In 1995, New York State could have saved up to $5.7 billion and the city up to $4.5 billion from such changes.

--Using up to $1.5 billion to give government employees incentive pay, such as gain sharing.

--Reducing discretionary tax breaks, like those given companies that threaten to pull up stakes, as these would become unnecessary if savings were used to cut taxes.

--Cutting state personal income taxes by 20 percent, business income taxes by 29 percent, and inheritance and gift taxes by 40 percent.

--Slashing city personal income taxes by 78 percent, eliminating city business income and real estate transaction cuts, and altering real property taxes to raise the bills of some under-taxed owners while cutting the bills of most others. Such moves would have cost the state and city nearly $11.7 billion in 1995.

Findings:

--New York spends 55 percent more on social welfare than the national average.

--New York and local communities spend 18 percent more on elementary and secondary spending than other states.

--Repaying bonds that pay for capital projects accounts for seven percent of state and local spending, 44 percent more than the national average.

--New York spends $4 of $10 on services from trash collection to the police, 29 percent more than other states.
