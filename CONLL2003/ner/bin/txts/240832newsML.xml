<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>The following list highlights some of the Citizen Budget Commission's recommendations and findings on restructuring New York and New York City.</p>
<p>The non-profit civic group said its proposals could save up to $15 billion a year.</p>
<p>--Expanding managed care, as Medicaid costs for acute care cost 58 percent more than the national average per patient.</p>
<p>--Curtailing the placing of foster children with relatives.</p>
<p>--Tightening eligibility rules for Medicaid to force the middle- and upper-class to pay a fairer share, and providing incentives to help people buy long-term health insurance.</p>
<p>--Cutting non-cash public aid to bring it in line with the rest of the country, while adjusting for the cost of living.</p>
<p>--Cutting state aid to wealthier school districts by 20 percent, saving $400 million a year, while allowing districts that did not want to slash spending to raise property taxes.</p>
<p>--Repealing the Wicks Law that requires localities to divide capital contracts whose cost exceeds $50,000 into at least 4 separate contracts, a move that could have saved the city about $720 million in capital costs in 1995.</p>
<p>--Improving regular maintenance plans to avoid costly upgrades later on.</p>
<p>--Setting clear priorities and eliminating items like state-run golf courses.</p>
<p>--Using competitive contracting, which would be open to state workers.</p>
<p>--Raising the government workforce's productivity by condolidating agencies and revamping union pacts and work rules. In 1995, New York State could have saved up to $5.7 billion and the city up to $4.5 billion from such changes.</p>
<p>--Using up to $1.5 billion to give government employees incentive pay, such as gain sharing.</p>
<p>--Reducing discretionary tax breaks, like those given companies that threaten to pull up stakes, as these would become unnecessary if savings were used to cut taxes.</p>
<p>--Cutting state personal income taxes by 20 percent, business income taxes by 29 percent, and inheritance and gift taxes by 40 percent.</p>
<p>--Slashing city personal income taxes by 78 percent, eliminating city business income and real estate transaction cuts, and altering real property taxes to raise the bills of some under-taxed owners while cutting the bills of most others. Such moves would have cost the state and city nearly $11.7 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Findings:</p>
<p>--New York spends 55 percent more on social welfare than the national average.</p>
<p>--New York and local communities spend 18 percent more on elementary and secondary spending than other states.</p>
<p>--Repaying bonds that pay for capital projects accounts for seven percent of state and local spending, 44 percent more than the national average.</p>
<p>--New York spends $4 of $10 on services from trash collection to the police, 29 percent more than other states.</p>
