<text>
<p>A New Mexico high school football player who used razor-sharp helmet buckles to slash opponents and a referee was expelled from high school banned Thursday from competition for one year.</p>
<p>Mike Cito, 17, was expelled from St Pius X High School in Albuquerque after an October game in which he used the sharpened chin strap buckles to injure two opposing players and the referee. One of the players need 10 stitches to a cut on his forearm.</p>
<p>Officials said the New Mexico Activities Association decided to bar Cito from any inter-scholastic competition until next October, regardless of the school he attends.</p>
<p>Cito's father, Stephen Cito, had admitted filing the metal buckles to a fine edge, saying he did it to get even with the referee and with players who had roughed up his son in a previous game.</p>
