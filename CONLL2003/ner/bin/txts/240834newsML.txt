Stock markets can become too exuberant -- Greenspan.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-05

The Federal Reserve must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets because that could end up doing damage to the economy, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Thursday.

In a lecture to a dinner meeting of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, Greenspan stopped short of commenting on the recent steep run-up in Wall Street prices.

But the central bank chief made clear that the Fed needed to factor the activities of bears and bulls on Wall Street into its deliberations on interest rates.

"Evaluating shifts in balance sheets generally, and in asset prices particularly, must be an integral part of the development of monetary policy," Greenspan said.

Blue-chip stock prices have soared 25 percent this year, leading some analysts to worry that the market may be setting itself up for a crash that could cripple the economy.

After slipping earlier this week from recent record highs, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.16 points on Thursday to close at 6,437.10.

"We as central bankers need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy, its production, jobs and price stability," Greenspan said. "Indeed, the sharp stock market break of 1987 had few negative consequences for the economy."

He quickly added that the central bank could not afford to underestimate or become complacent about the complex links between the prices of such assets as stock and real estate and the economy.

It is not clear what, if anything, the Fed can do if it fears that the financial markets have gotten ahead of themselves and are setting themselves up for a crash.

If the central bank decides to raise interest rates to cool off speculative fervor, it risks triggering the very collapse it is seeking to avoid, analysts said.

Greenspan himself was influential in containing the economic fall-out from the October 1987 crash by promising to provide the financial system with liquidity if needed. On Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow Jones industrial average of blue chip shares fell by 508 points.

The Fed holds its next policy-making meeting Dec. 17 and is widely expected to opt to hold interest rates steady amid signs of moderate economic growth with steady inflation.

Greenspan said that inflation has been low, but added that its "future course remains uncertain."

Labour markets are tight but product markets are, in Greenspan's words, "comfortable" -- an apparent allusion to the lack of shortages. That is a combination with "scant historic precedent," he added.

Because interest rate changes work on the economy with a lag, the Fed needs to be forward looking in setting policy, taking action before dangers develop, Greenspan said.

"It means that often we need to tighten or ease before the need for action is evident to the public at large, and that policy may have to reverse course from time to time as the underlying forces acting on the economy shift," he said.

That can prove puzzling to the public, whose support, he said, is needed for the Fed to pursue its goals of maximum employment, sustainable economic growth and price stability.

The central bank is not helped in winning public backing for its actions by what Greenspan called the "misperception" that it is a "secretive organisation."

To help correct that, the Fed is looking to expand the flow of information to the public, he added.

The Fed's task has not been made any easier by the increasing difficultly statisticians face in measuring inflation and thus in pinning down exactly what constitutes price stability, the Fed chairman said.

A Congressionally-appointed commission this week concluded that the most popular measure of inflation -- the consumer price index -- overstates the cost of living by 1.1 percentage points per year.
