French police briefly detain four in Basque swoops.

BORDEAUX, France 1996-12-06

French police briefly detained four people in Friday after searches of suspected Basque separatist homes in a southwestern village, police sources said.

Police, acting on the orders of a Paris anti-terrorism magistrate, targeted two houses and three flats in the village of Sare in the Pyrenees Atlantiques, believed linked to ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom).

Four people were detained but freed after several hours with police apparently having little to show for the raids. The searches were a follow-up to the arrest in July in France of a suspected ETA leader, Julian Achurra Egurola, known as "Pototo".

The group has killed some 800 people in the 28 years it has been struggling for Basque independence. The searches came three days after police found 36 anti-tank rockets in Pau, in the same area.
