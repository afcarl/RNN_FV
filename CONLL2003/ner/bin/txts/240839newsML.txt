Central Africans in France occupy Paris embassy.

PARIS 1996-12-06

About two dozen nationals of the Central African Republic occupied their country's Paris embassy on Friday, demanding the resignation of their country's president following an army rebellion.

"We ask for peace, the resignation of President (Ange-Felix) Patasse and an end to intervention by French forces," said one of the occupiers, who would identify himself only as "Citizen of the Central African Republic".

"We say 'no' to French forces and 'yes' to the establishment of democracy," said the man.

He said about a hundred Central African residents were on the way to the embassy from outside Paris to join their peaceful protest.

While the ambassador had departed, all other embassy employees had remained at their posts, he said. "We all had lunch together. We're having a great time."

Speaking at a Franco-African summit in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, on Friday, French President Jacques Chirac said that French troops would not interfere in the internal affairs of the Central African Republic.

"French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities," he said.

The latest uprising in Bangui began on November 16 over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple Patasse, sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital.

Chirac said Paris opposed violence aimed at Bangui's elected government, which has been the target of three army mutinies this year.

French soldiers, which have openly propped up Patasse on previous occasions, only opened fire this time when rebels attacked a central Bangui hotel on Thursday.

Chirac said Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore would visit Bangui "in the coming hours" with the heads of state of Gabon, Mali and Chad to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels.

Compaore said the fighting in Bangui appeared to be part of a struggle for power, and his trip there would be a fact-finding mission to try to prevent trouble from spreading and suggest peaceful solutions.
