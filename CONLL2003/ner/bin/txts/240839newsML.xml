<p>About two dozen nationals of the Central African Republic occupied their country's Paris embassy on Friday, demanding the resignation of their country's president following an army rebellion.</p>
<p>&quot;We ask for peace, the resignation of President (Ange-Felix) Patasse and an end to intervention by French forces,&quot; said one of the occupiers, who would identify himself only as &quot;Citizen of the Central African Republic&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We say 'no' to French forces and 'yes' to the establishment of democracy,&quot; said the man.</p>
<p>He said about a hundred Central African residents were on the way to the embassy from outside Paris to join their peaceful protest.</p>
<p>While the ambassador had departed, all other embassy employees had remained at their posts, he said. &quot;We all had lunch together. We're having a great time.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking at a Franco-African summit in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, on Friday, French President Jacques Chirac said that French troops would not interfere in the internal affairs of the Central African Republic.</p>
<p>&quot;French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The latest uprising in Bangui began on November 16 over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple Patasse, sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital.</p>
<p>Chirac said Paris opposed violence aimed at Bangui's elected government, which has been the target of three army mutinies this year.</p>
<p>French soldiers, which have openly propped up Patasse on previous occasions, only opened fire this time when rebels attacked a central Bangui hotel on Thursday.</p>
<p>Chirac said Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore would visit Bangui &quot;in the coming hours&quot; with the heads of state of Gabon, Mali and Chad to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels.</p>
<p>Compaore said the fighting in Bangui appeared to be part of a struggle for power, and his trip there would be a fact-finding mission to try to prevent trouble from spreading and suggest peaceful solutions.</p>
