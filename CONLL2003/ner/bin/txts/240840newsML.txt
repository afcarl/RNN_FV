French lower house backs Corsica tax break plan.

PARIS 1996-12-06

France's National Assembly on Friday approved sweeping tax breaks for Corsica as part of a government plan to try to defuse two decades of guerrilla violence on the Mediterranean island.

Centre-right parties in the ruling coalition voted for the bill while the opposition Socialists and Communists parties voted against, arguing the scheme was insufficient and poorly planned.

The five-year plan, costing the state three billion francs ($580 million), will grant tax breaks to businesses operating on the island of 250,000 inhabitants.

Territorial Planning Minister Jean-Claude Gaudin hailed the plan as a "helping hand to the Corsican economy."

"Development is the only way of preserving the identity of this territory," he told the assembly.

The Senate, or upper house, has to approve the bill before it becomes law. The Senate, where parties in the centre-right government also have a strong majority, will debate the plan on December 17.

The island, racked by thousands of separatist bombings since the 1970s, was the scene of another explosion overnight in Porto-Vecchio, one of several Corsican ports blocked by a fishermen's protest. No one was hurt and no one claimed responsibility for the bomb.

The blast late on Thursday destroyed a building in the south-eastern port that included the ticket offices of SNCM, the main shipping company serving the French island.

Fishermen are blocking the ports of Ajaccio, Bastia, Porto-Vecchio and Ile Rousse to push for concessions in the government tax plan. Fishermen want cuts in payroll charges and want fuel prices pegged to those in a mainland French port.

A court on Wednesday told fishermen to lift a blockade that has kept an SNCM car ferry in Ajaccio since Tuesday, ordering them to pay 100,000 francs ($20,000) for every day the blockade lasts as well as a fine of 10,000 francs.
