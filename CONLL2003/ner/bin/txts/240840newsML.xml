<title>FRANCE: French lower house backs Corsica tax break plan.</title>
<headline>French lower house backs Corsica tax break plan.</headline>

<text>
<p>France's National Assembly on Friday approved sweeping tax breaks for Corsica as part of a government plan to try to defuse two decades of guerrilla violence on the Mediterranean island.</p>
<p>Centre-right parties in the ruling coalition voted for the bill while the opposition Socialists and Communists parties voted against, arguing the scheme was insufficient and poorly planned.</p>
<p>The five-year plan, costing the state three billion francs ($580 million), will grant tax breaks to businesses operating on the island of 250,000 inhabitants.</p>
<p>Territorial Planning Minister Jean-Claude Gaudin hailed the plan as a &quot;helping hand to the Corsican economy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Development is the only way of preserving the identity of this territory,&quot; he told the assembly.</p>
<p>The Senate, or upper house, has to approve the bill before it becomes law. The Senate, where parties in the centre-right government also have a strong majority, will debate the plan on December 17.</p>
<p>The island, racked by thousands of separatist bombings since the 1970s, was the scene of another explosion overnight in Porto-Vecchio, one of several Corsican ports blocked by a fishermen's protest. No one was hurt and no one claimed responsibility for the bomb.</p>
<p>The blast late on Thursday destroyed a building in the south-eastern port that included the ticket offices of SNCM, the main shipping company serving the French island.</p>
<p>Fishermen are blocking the ports of Ajaccio, Bastia, Porto-Vecchio and Ile Rousse to push for concessions in the government tax plan. Fishermen want cuts in payroll charges and want fuel prices pegged to those in a mainland French port.</p>
<p>A court on Wednesday told fishermen to lift a blockade that has kept an SNCM car ferry in Ajaccio since Tuesday, ordering them to pay 100,000 francs ($20,000) for every day the blockade lasts as well as a fine of 10,000 francs.</p>
