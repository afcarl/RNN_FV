<p>Anti-corruption magistrates dealt new blows to President Jacques Chirac's Gaullist RPR party on Friday, ordering its personnel chief detained for another 24 hours and placing the Paris mayor's wife under investigation.</p>
<p>In another case, three ex-budget ministers -- Socialists Henri Emmanuelli and Michel Charasse, and the RPR's Nicolas Sarkozy -- were called before a Paris judge in a probe on alleged tax breaks linked to funding of political parties.</p>
<p>As probes into an alleged covert RPR funding scheme widened, justice sources said Louise-Yvonne Casetta, nicknamed &quot;la cassette&quot; (the cashbox) because she was regarded as RPR shadow treasurer, would be held for another 24 hours for questioning by Nanterre magistrate Patrick Desmure on suspicion of graft.</p>
<p>The sources said Casetta, picked up by police before dawn on Thursday, could be formally placed under investigation later on Friday. Her new detention order expires on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>She is suspected of misuse of corporate funds in connection with alleged illicit funding of the RPR by the construction firm Maillard et Duclos in 1992-93. Casetta was head of personnel at party headquarters until last September but is widely regarded as having been its main secret fundraiser.</p>
<p>Justice sources said she was questioned chiefly about links between RPR funding and public works contracts.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Jacques Toubon, a faithful Chirac lieutenant, told reporters he had &quot;strictly no comment to make save that justice works better than people often say&quot;.</p>
<p>In a probe also targetting the RPR, judges in Evry outside Paris placed Xaviere Tiberi, wife of the RPR man who succeeded Chirac as mayor of the capital, under investigation for misuse of public funds, justice sources said.</p>
<p>Investigating magistrates Dominique Pauthe and Chantal Solaro notified her by letter, the sources said. Mayor Jean Tiberi's wife is suspected of having been paid 200,000 francs ($40,000) for a 36-page report largely copied out of a book.</p>
<p>The magistrates sent a similar letter to Xavier Dugoin, RPR president of the Essone regional authority outside Paris, notifying him that he had also been placed under investigation for allegedly paying the sum.</p>
<p>Toubon has acknowledged ordering a helicopter chartered to track down a magistrate holidaying in Nepal in an effort to head off the probe of Mrs Tiberi, which was being pursued in the magistrate's absence by an independent-minded deputy.</p>
<p>In a separate case, the weekly Le Point reported that the three former budget ministers had been summoned by Paris Judge Laurence Vichinievsky about alleged tax breaks for the water utility Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE).</p>
<p>Le Point said the tax breaks may have been a counterpart to covert funding of political parties by CGE linked to public works contracts.</p>
<p>Emanuelli's lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve said the two Socialists may refuse the judge's summons for early next week.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see why the judge did not also summon (Prime Minister) Alain Juppe who was budget minister in 1986-88,&quot; he said. Sarkozy could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The judge, who in October placed Communist leader Robert Hue and his predecessor Georges Marchais under investigation, is probing CGE's payment of nearly 13 million francs ($2.6 million) in 1992-94 linked to local water contracts in some 70 towns.</p>
<p>France has been plagued since 1990 with a seemingly endless series of corruption scandals involving covert funding of all the major parties through rake-offs on public contracts.</p>
<p>The scandals first hit the late president Francois Mitterrand's Socialist Party and played a major role in its landslide general election defeat in 1993.</p>
<p>Graft-busting magistrates have since uncovered what they suspect was a huge covert funding system for the Gaullists based on rake-offs from public works contracts in the Paris region while Chirac was mayor of the capital.</p>
