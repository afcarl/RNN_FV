New draft EU treaty gets positive reviews.

Ireland's draft European Union treaty got high marks from EU foreign ministers on Friday despite huge differences among member nations over what reforms are needed for the bloc to succeed in the future.

German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said  parts of the draft -- to be handed to EU leaders at a summit in Dublin next week -- were "ambititious".

"It shows that progress has been made," he told reporters. "But there is considerable need for discussion."

Italy said in a statement that the treaty, designed to prepare the bloc for a dozen or more new members next century, was a "satisfactory text open to further improvements".

Even Britain, opposed to many of the proposals contained in the draft, said the document was fair.

"It is a well-judged and competent piece of work," a British official said, seeking to play down predictions that the treaty draft would feed the turmoil over Europe currently infecting the ruling Conservative party.

The draft, unveiled by Ireland on Thursday, is designed as a working paper for an enventual treaty to be approved by EU leaders at a summit in Amsterdam in June next year.

Seeking to avoid a row at the Dublin summit on December 13 and 14, Ireland made no suggestions for how to deal with some of the most controversial issues.

These include whether to water down a country's right to veto EU legislation, how many European commissioners there should be in an expanded Union, and how to permit "flexibility" -- allowing some countries to integrate faster than others.

Despite this, the draft does contain proposals likely to be jumped on by Euro-sceptics in Britain, Denmark and elsewhere.

Britain, for example, has already said it will not countenance a proposal to lift border controls across the bloc.

Denmark, meanwhile, has indicated its opposition to plans to give the European Commission more of a say in external affairs, notably in trade in services.

Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said the Irish presidency had done a good job but there were elements that were not acceptable to Denmark.

Others said the draft did not go far enough. Germany's Kinkel, for example, told reporters there was not enough progress on strengthening the bloc's joint foreign policy decision-making.

Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said when arriving at the meeting that he was pleased with initial reaction from most member states to the draft.

Asked whether it would be possible to reach a compromise, especially in view of British scepticism about further EU integration, he told reporters:

"I think in terms of the interests of the citizens of Europe that we should work very hard to ensure we have the necessary compromise in Amsterdam."
