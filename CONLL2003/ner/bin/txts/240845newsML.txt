Police on Friday raided the homes and offices of Antonio Di Pietro, a former minister and the most popular man in Italy for his judicial assault on corruption.

Italian media reported that some 300 agents were involved in the raids, ordered by magistrates in the northern town of Brescia who are probing alleged irregularities by Di Pietro when he was a star anti-graft magistrate.

His attorney, Massimo Dinoia, told Reuters that agents had seized a number of legal documents on various subjects from Di Pietro's home in the town of Curno, near Milan.

Dinoia said Di Pietro, who returned to Milan from Rome on Friday morning, was not present, but added that his wife and two small children had been awakened by police.

"His only worry is that he won't be able to defend himself because they have seized these documents," said parliamentarian Elio Veltri, a friend who spoke with Di Pietro on Friday.

Italian radio and news agencies said police conducted about 50 raids of which around 10 were in Rome.

The searches, carried out by special finance police investigators and comparable to large-scale Mafia raids, also targeted several of Di Pietro's business associates and lawyers. Brescia magistrates would not comment on the case.

Friday's raids fell on the second anniversary of Di Pietro's unexpected departure from the judiciary, a step that he has never fully explained.

Di Pietro, who belongs to no political party, quit the Milan magistrature on December 6, 1994, shortly after the pool placed then-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi under investigation, amid rumours that he had been forced out.

"Exactly two years ago Di Pietro announced his resignation and today we have this nice little present," Dinoia said.

Berlusconi's brother Paolo and his defence minister Cesare Previti are both on trial in Brescia accused of plotting to discredit Di Pietro. They deny the charges.

The Di Pietro investigation began last month, prompting him to quit the post as public works minister he took on in May in the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi.

In his resignation letter, Di Pietro said the probe was "pigeon shoot", implying it was part of what he has portrayed as a vendetta by defendants he helped expose in his investigations.

"It is clear that this type of operation is only used when police are dealing with a major criminal and not a magistrate (whose case) could be questionable," said parliamentarian Nando Della Chiesa.

"This is sort of like the Stations of the Cross," Veltri said, referring to the events in Christ's crucifixion.

Di Pietro, 46, was the star investigator of the elite "Clean Hands" anti-graft team in Milan, which from 1992 launched a series of probes that destroyed Italy's political establishment and involved hundreds of businessmen.

The probes uncovered widespread payments of bribes by businesses to political parties in exchange for government contracts. Di Pietro, a policeman before turning prosecutor, was seen as the symbol of the anti-graft assault and public opinion polls still show him to be the most popular man in Italy.

Di Pietro was the target of an earlier probe by Brescia magistrates into allegations of corruption and of profiting from holding a public office. All charges against him were dropped in April shortly before he was named to the cabinet.
