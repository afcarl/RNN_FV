Unidentified gunmen shot at a group of Manchester United soccer fans in a red-light district of Vienna on Friday after a row in a bar, hitting one in the stomach and another in the leg, police said.

The gunmen opened fire from a white Mercedes saloon, which sped past the group of four Britons as they were making their way back to their hotel from a bar in one of Vienna's less salubrious quarters.

A Vienna doctor said Steven Mark Day, 33, whose stomach injury was earlier described as life-threatening, had undergone a three-hour abdominal operation and was now out of danger.

"He is in intensive care and is out of danger," Dr Michael Kilga of the Sozialmedizinisches Zentrum Ost hospital said.

"We have to wait two or three days to see if there are any complications but he should be able to leave hospital in 10 to 14 days," he said.

A second man, Christopher Mackenner, was shot in the lower part of his right leg, and should be out of hospital in about a week, he added.

Two other men, Josef Vickers and Paul Francis Orel, escaped without injury after diving for cover on hearing the gunfire, just metres (yards) from their three-star Reichshof hotel, police said.

The Manchester United fans were in the Austrian capital for a match last Wednesday night against Rapid Vienna. The fans' hotel is a 20-minute walk from the Ernst Happel stadium where Manchester United won the European Champions' league match 2-0.

A worker at the Piccolo Sauna bar where the fans were last seen before the shooting said they arrived accompanied by two Austrians, well-known in the red light district.

"They had two beers each and all of a sudden they started arguing. I don't know the reason but I don't think it was about girls or football," the worker, who preferred to remain anonymous, told Reuters.

"They didn't hit out at each other, it was just an argument. I think it was all down to a bit too much alcohol," said the worker, standing near the mirror-enclosed dancefloor.

The big neon-lit bar is one of many employing female dancers near Vienna's Prater amusement park, which houses the famous giant ferris-wheel -- the Riesenrad -- featured in the 1949 film of Graham Greene's classic novel "The Third Man".

"When the argument started to get louder, they were told to leave. The British men left first and then the Austrians went out later," the bar worker said.

Bar staff knew nothing of the shooting until police cars screeched to a halt in the road and officers began questioning the clientele.
