Iran is making overtures to buy troubled east German heavy machinery maker Sket Magdeburg GmbH, government officials said on Friday.

Iranian Minister for Mines and Metals Mohammad Hossein Mahlouji and Saxony Anhalt's state economics minister Klaus Schucht have signed a letter of intent, officials at the Iranian embassy and the state government said.

Mahlouji visited the machinery plant for two hours on Thursday. Saxony Anhalt spokesman Hans Juergen Fink said Iran hoped to buy Sket as a whole or in parts, and would soon name Iranian enterprises that would participate in the deal.

Wolf Schoede, spokesman for the BvS privatisation agency, told German radio, "We hope the Iranian delegation quickly makes concrete its intentions ... so we know what jobs, what investments and what future concept we are talking about,"

BvS will make a formal review of the Iranian plan when concrete proposals are presented, BvS, the successor to the Treuhand agency, said in a statement.

Germany, Iran's largest European trading partner, has come under fire from other leading nations for its close relations with Iran, which owes it $13 billion.

But Bonn's policy of dialogue has recently been strained by the Berlin trial of five men for the 1992 killing of three Kurdish dissidents and their translator in Berlin. Prosecutors allege Teheran ordered the killings.

Mahlouji on Friday discussed Iran's interest in Sket on Friday in Bonn with Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, who said he would welcome Iran's investment, particularly in east Germany, a ministry statement said.

German government spokesman Peter Hausmann said it was still too early to speak of sale negotiations.

Fink said the letter of intent contained few details or specific commitments, but an Iranian embassy spokesman said Iran intended to maintain for the long term the work force that exists at the time of an eventual purchase.

Sket, which once employed 18,000 workers and was a main supplier to communist eastern Europe, has absorbed billions in state aid after posting heavy losses since German unification. Officials say it continues to lose half a million marks ($325,000) a day.

BvS approved earlier this week a restructuring plan that would split Sket into five companies and shrink the workforce to 425 workers from 1,850.

"We don't have a day to lose with this restructuring. Parallel to it we will be looking at the offers for the privatisation, which since yesterday apparently includes the Iranian interest," Schoede said.

Investment bank West Merchant Bank has been named to manage the restructuring.

BvS said it would release over 200 million marks in restructuring funds only after the European Commission approves the restructuring plan.

The five companies set to continue Sket's work have already been founded and are due to start up on January 2, leaving only a narrow window of opportunity.

"Customers and suppliers need certainty. The name Sket must be clearly represented in the market," Schoede said.

In mid-October Sket filed for liquidation proceedings after its workforce refused to support a drastic cost-cutting programme that would have cut the workforce by two-thirds.
