<p>Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis stood firm on Friday against a nine-day road blockade by angry farmers using thousands of tractors, saying his government would not bow to blackmail.</p>
<p>&quot;The seizure of the road network is blackmail and no government should bow to blackmail. We had a dialogue with the farmers but dialogue has its limits,&quot; Simitis told parliament.</p>
<p>The farmers have blocked some 50 main junctions around Greece with a fleet of 10,000 tractors to press demands for price supports, cheaper fuel, the rescheduling of $1.3 billion in debts and lower Value Added Tax (VAT) on farming equipment.</p>
<p>Simitis fears that satisfying farmers' demands would encourage other groups to make demands on a 1997 austerity budget intended to set the economy on a convergence course with European Union partners.</p>
<p>&quot;The price of satisfying the farmers' demands is four billion dollars, equal to the amount which we are desperately trying to secure from new taxes and spending cuts in the budget,&quot; Simitis said.</p>
<p>&quot;We called on the Greek people to make sacrifices and some block the roads and threaten to destroy this effort. We tell them that we will not endanger the country's future,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But Simitis's tough stand has done little to resolve the crisis and the farmers seem determined to continue the revolt.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is no agreement everything is possible including taking our tractors and heading down to Athens,&quot; Yannis Pattakis, farmers' representative said.</p>
<p>Government officials said police had been given orders to keep open the Isthmus bridge linking Athens with the southwestern Pelepponese peninsula so that the capital can be supplied with farm products.</p>
<p>&quot;The Isthmus blocking will be our next move. When Athens feels the heat then the government will think twice,&quot; said Apostolis Kabouris, another farmer.</p>
<p>Simitis gave no hint of what he would, or could, do to force the defiant farmers off the roads.</p>
<p>International and domestic land transport has ground to a halt and queues of stalled lorries stretch along motorways with irate drivers complaining about food, water and sanitation.</p>
<p>&quot;Truck drivers have been stranded for days with no food. Tonnes of sensitive products like milk and meat have been ruined. We appeal to both the farmers and the government to reach a compromise,&quot; said Nikos Daditsas, a Greek truck drivers union leader.</p>
<p>Similar appeals were made by various other groups like the Greek Industries Association, the Northern Greek Exporters Union and the Greek Railways Organisation.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in central Greece have filed charges against the farmers for blocking transport but it was doubtful police would move towards the barricades to make any arrests.</p>
<p>Athens newspapers said the economy had suffered a loss of $12 million in the first week of the protest and that the amount was growing fast.</p>
