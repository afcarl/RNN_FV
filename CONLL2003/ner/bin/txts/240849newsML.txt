Munich Re, the world's leading reinsurer, on Friday assured shareholders they would receive an unchanged dividend of 16 marks this business year even though group earnings may dip below last year's records.

Chairman Hans-Juergen Schinzler told the group's shareholder meeting that the payout for 1995/1996 -- which marked an unprecedented jump from 13.50 marks -- was "also secured for the current year."

At the same time, he warned that the company's reinsurance units were unlikely to match the strong earnings achieved last year, making a fall in group profits likely by end-June 1997.

The reassurance on payout prospects follows one of Munich Re's most profitable, and eventful, years ever.

The group, whose full name is Muenchener Rueckversicherungs AG, posted a dramatic surge in earnings in its 1995/1996 business year, with earnings per share more than doubling to 140 marks on the back of a return to underwriting profit.

In addition, it agreed a mega-takeover of American Re, a major player in U.S. reinsurance, acquired Germany's biggest health insurer Deutsche Krankenversicherungs AG(DKV) and succeeded in having its shares included on the blue-chip DAX index in September after a long campaign.

The events, especially the DAX inclusion, which generally boosts interest in a stock, combined to push Munich Re's registered stock up nearly 40 percent from lows set in May this year, four times faster than the DAX's rise in the period.

On Friday, Munich Re's registered shares were down 68 marks marks at 3,680, in line with a sharply downward market trend.

Given the upheaval of the past year, analysts generally expect calmer times ahead for Munich Re and see dividend payouts remaining steady for the time being, even though earnings are likely to fluctuate somewhat.

Munich Re itself has said in the past that it opted for such an abrupt rise in its dividend in 1995/1996 in order to get the payout to a sustainable level.

Schinzler said on Friday however that the hike should not be seen as a signal that there was no more upside potential on dividends.

He also told shareholders that the events of 1996 would impact on Munich Re's 1996/1997 accounts and that consolidating DKV would add two billion marks to group premium income, which was just under 29 billion marks ($18.9 billion) last year.

In addition, Schinzler said the group had been once again relatively unaffected by natural catastrophes in the year to date. Its 1996 claims count toward its accounts for the 1996/1997 business year.

Schinzler also finally confirmed plans to switch Munich Re's shares to a lower par value next year -- in line with a trend in Germany to lower the price of shares and help boost their liquidity.

Munich Re's shares, now the most expensive on the DAX, are to be split 10-for-one, which will cut their price to around one tenth of their current level. Schinzler said the switch would probably take effect in September at the earliest.
