Paris studies train security, mystery blast.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Paris authorities studied tighter security on trains on Friday as investigators probed a mystery blast in the countryside last month that may have been a test for Tuesday's train bomb that killed three people.

False bomb alerts disrupted traffic on the tightly-guarded Paris underground rail network after the bomb planted by suspected Algerian Islamic guerrillas tore through a train at the Port-Royal station.

The blast claimed a third victim when a 25-year-old Moroccan student, Mohamed Benchaou, died of his injuries on Thursday night. Twenty people were still in hospital on Friday out of a total of 94 treated for injuries.

The head of the Paris regional transport authority said he was studying extra security to seal the areas under seats in trains and buses to make it harder to conceal bombs.

Tuesday's bomb, concealed in a bulky 13-kg (27-pound) gas canister, was placed under a seat in a bag.

"We have to work out whether it would be efficient. I have ordered a study," Jean-Paul Bailly told Radio Luxembourg, adding that it would involve redesigning 200,000 seats in underground trains and more than 300,000 in buses.

He also said the transport authority would study wider use of surveillance cameras to record what was going on in stations.

Investigators, expecting a long and painstaking probe, were also looking into an explosion south of Paris overnight on November 19 which they suspect was a test run for the bomb on the rush-hour train, gendarme sources said.

They confirmed a report in the daily Le Parisien that a gas canister bomb similar to the one used in Tuesday's attack had exploded in a workers' shed on waste ground in the Essonne region. No one was hurt.

"The theory that the terrorists carried out a test before acting is being taken seriously," Le Parisien said. The probe, first entrusted to the gendarmes, was handed to Paris anti-terrorism magistrates.

On Friday bomb disposal experts were called out to the Gare du Nord after a suspect package was found at about 7 a.m. (0600 GMT), hitting trains on two lines of the RER suburban express railway.

Another suspect package was found at the Chatelet station but traffic was unaffected. Both proved false alerts. Several similar false alarms were reported in the southern port of Marseille where a shopping centre was evacuated.

Investigators said they suspected Algerian militants primarily because the bombing methods and target were strikingly similar to a series of bloody attacks last year claimed by fundamentalist rebels from the former French colony.

Last year's bombs killed eight people and injured more than 160.

The rebels accuse France of backing the Algiers government in a war that has claimed an estimated 50,000 lives since 1992, when the authorities scrapped elections that Islamic fundamentalist candidates were poised to win.
