Algerian fundamentalists kill 19 civilians.

PARIS 1996-12-06

In a second night of carnage, Moslem fundamentalists killed 19 civilians overnight in Blida province south of Algiers, bringing to 29 the death toll in under 48 hours, Algerian security forces said on Friday.

A security force statement carried by the official Algerian news agency said the 19 had been killed in the village of Benachour by "a group of terrorists".

It described them as having been killed "in a cowardly way", a term used by Algerian authorities when the victims have had their throats slit.

Benachour lies not far from Boufarik where security forces said on Thursday that 10 civilians had been slain in a similar way on Trab Farm during Wednesday night.

Both Benachour and Boufarik are in the province of Blida whose provincial capital is both the headquarters of Algeria's number one military region and a bastion of Moslem fundamentalism.

Algerian authorities have blamed Moslem fundamentalists for a series of massacres of civilians in the past two months, usually on isolated villages during the night.

Last month, suspected fundamentalists killed 18 people in two overnight attacks in Medea province, bringing to more than 90 the number of people to have died in two weeks.

One of the most deadly attacks, also in Blida province, took place early in November when 38 people were slain in one village. Most had their throats cut and several were mutilated.

In another attack early in November Moslem rebels killed 10 women and three children, cutting their throats one by one, in a village near Algiers.

That mass killing came less than a month after Moslem guerrillas killed 38 bus and car passengers at a fake roadblock in the southern province of Laghouat.

The latest overnight killing followed a statement by President Liamine Zeroual this week to judges and magistrates that Algeria was determined to build a strong state of law.

About 60,000 people have died in Algeria's violence since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead.
