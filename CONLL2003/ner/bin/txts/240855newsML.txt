Parliament committee approves German tax bill.

BONN 1996-12-06

Germany's parliamentary mediation committee on Thursday night approved a compromise deal on the 1997 tax bill, clearing the way for a final vote this year and handing the government a victory over scrapping a wealth tax.

The mediation committee, made up of representatives from the two houses of parliament, agreed 8.2 billion marks in tax increases to offset the loss of 9.3 billion marks in revenues to Germany's 16 states from dropping the wealth tax.

Joachim Horster, of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), said that political posturing over the issue had given way to pragmatism in the overnight talks.

"Political statements were made -- and that was that," Hoerster told reporters on Friday morning.

The tax bill will formally clear the mediation process on December 12, leaving time for a final vote in the Bundesrat upper house, probably on December 19, Hoerster said.

With the bill's passage, the final element of Finance Minister Theo Waigel's austerity plan for 1997 -- when he wants Germany to qualify for European monetary union -- should fall into place.

The opposition Social Democrats (SPD), who control the Bundesrat upper house, had been blocking the abolition of the tax, which had been ruled illegal by the constitutional court.

But they finally caved in after leaders in Kohl's coalition government threatened last week to let the tax bill fail -- which would have meant the tax would have been scrapped automatically at the start of 1997.

CDU negotiators welcomed the result, while the SPD said it still wanted to keep wealth taxes on private fortunes and would introduce legislation in parliament to do so.

Chief SPD negotiator, Hamburg mayor Henning Voscherau, said his party would keep up the pressure to maintain the private wealth tax in forthcoming parliamentary sessions -- and would link the issue to planned reforms of company taxation.

Under the tax compromise, property dealing taxes will rise by more than originally planned, to 3.5 percent from two percent, raising revenues by 5.25 billion marks.

Higher inheritance tax rates will raise an extra 2.5 billion marks, while changes to corporation tax and subsidies for housing construction will raise a further 415 million.

Despite the political row over the wealth tax, government and opposition found common ground over putting a moratorium on imposing a capital trading tax -- currently only raised in west Germany -- in the depressed former communist east.

The CDU's Joachim Hoerster told reporters that his party would examine an SPD proposal on the moratorium -- separately to the other disputes about company taxation.
