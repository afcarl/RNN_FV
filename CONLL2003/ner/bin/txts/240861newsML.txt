Henkel takeover welcome, but cost high.

German chemicals group Henkel KGaA scored a strategic coup with its acquisition of U.S. adhesives group Loctite Corp, but the high price of the deal worried markets on Friday.

Henkel and Loctite said late on Thursday they had agreed a merger under which Henkel will acquire the 65 percent of Loctite it does not already own for about $1.3 billion, or $61 in cash per share.

The deal ended weeks of wrangling over the price during which Henkel was forced to raise its initial bid of $56 dollars a share.

"From a strategic point, the merger is absolutely super," said Sven Dopke, analyst at MM Warburg in Hamburg.

For Henkel, whose market position is primarily in Europe, acquiring the U.S. sealants and coverings maker represents not only a geographical improvement but also a technological and financial boost.

"Henkel's product line was not broad enough and they will really benefit from what Loctite has to offer," said another analyst, who asked not to be named.

Loctite, based in Hartford, Connecticut, earned $84 million, or $2.40 a share, on revenues of $785 million in 1995.

U.S. ratings agency Standard and Poor's, reaffirming its ratings, said: "The rating affirmation reflects that, from a business perspective, the acquisition of Loctite, one of its largest competitors, strongly reinforces Henkel's global number one position in both industrial and consumer adhesives."

However, because of Henkel's high debt load Standard and Poor's said its overall outlook on the company was negative.

Analysts agreed that Henkel, which last year bought German hair care group Hans Schwarzkopf GmbH from Hoechst AG, needed to act quickly to buy the rest of Loctite.

Although the German group already owned a 35 percent stake, reports that a white knight might be ready to fend off Henkel's offer prompted the firm to quickly raise its offer price.

"The price is relatively high, but this was the only chance Henkel had to get the rest of Loctite. Opportunities like this don't come around that often, so even the rather high price can be justified," Dopke said.

Henkel plans to finance the acquisition with debt, which relieved some analysts but still worried the market, where the share price fell over five percent in bourse trade to 73 marks.

Traders stressed that part of the drop was due to the overall decline of the German share index, ending floor trading down over four percent, but added the financing question helped offset some of the undisputed long-term benefits of the deal.

Standard and Poor's "negative outlook" on the company may also have troubled the market, dealers said.

But analysts said the company, which has holdings in German chemical company Degussa AG, may try to sell some of these stakes to help offset the purchase price.

"I think the company is probably working hard to get rid of some of these holdings and this could net them nearly one billion marks, which would be quite positive," an analyst said.
