Frankfurt shares seen rebounding on Dow bounce.

FRANKFURT 1996-12-06

German shares were expected to bounce back on Monday in response to Wall Street trimming back its opening loss, Frankfurt traders said.

The IBIS DAX held steady at 2,824.12, down 70.31 points, but well up from its intra-day low of 2,759.68. The German index climbed back over 2,800 as the Dow Jones average slumped more than 150 points and then recovered to 6,353.99, down 83.11.

"The sell-off in Germany was factoring into the Dow, but now the Dow has bounced so we should have a nice little squeeze on Monday," one trader said.  

Hardest hit on the DAX were export-heavy shares such as the chemical groups pressured by the dollar dipping to 1.53 marks from 23-month highs around 1.56.

In IBIS trading, BASF AG was down 2.65 marks, or 4.25 percent, to 58.60 marks, while Bayer AG fell 2.19 marks to 62.05. Hoechst AG fell 1.68 marks to 67.95.

Industrial group Mannesmann AG, which rose on Thursday on rumours of a telecommunications alliance, retreated 18 to 643 marks, but up from a low of 640.

Frankfurt economists also said German shares still have room to grow through the end of the year.  

"We could go even lower on Monday after we see how the U.S. market reacts," said a Bank Julius Baer economist.

"The bourse still has upward momentum because German profits are still climbing and the German market as a whole could be even more attractive if other markets fall," he said.

Other economists called Friday's fall a healthy correction, saying the DAX had climbed too quickly in its 100-point ascent to the 2,900 point level in the last week.
