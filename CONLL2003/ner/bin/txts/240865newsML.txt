STOCKHOLM, Sweden

Swedish appliance maker Electrolux said Friday it would combine the appliance and outdoor product businesses of American Yard Products, Frigidaire Co. and Poulan/Weed Eater in the United States and Canada.

Electrolux said the merger will take effect Jan. 1.

"This new structure will allow Electrolux to capitalise on and develop synergies in these two core business areas," Electrolux said.

It said Hans Backman had been named to lead the process across the Electrolux group. Robert Cook was appointed president of the combined organisation.

"We are entering a new phase of development for major appliances and outdoor products in North America," said Leif Johansson, Electrolux president and chief executive officer.

"Our customers will benefit from better service and support and from continued new product introductions."
