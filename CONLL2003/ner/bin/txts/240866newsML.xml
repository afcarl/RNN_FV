<headline>N.Europe rapeseed touch lower on lack of buying.</headline>
<dateline>HAMBURG 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Rapeseed hardly traded in north west Europe but prices eased only slightly as tight supplies and a firmer dollar lent some support, brokers said on Friday.</p>
<p>Interest from Polish buyers also underpinned the market.</p>
<p>December rapeseed buyers free Hamburg were down 2.50 marks a tonne on the week at 462.50 compared with mid-week highs of 470.</p>
<p>As prices remained historically high, crushers focused on soybeans while others have planned stoppages in their rapeseed lines over the Christmas/New Year holiday period.</p>
<p>Traders estimated 1996/97 EU rapeseed crushings at 6.2 million tonnes compared with 8.1 million in 95/96 and mid-October estimates by Oil World newsletter of 6.6 million.</p>
<p>In products markets, rape oil was not required because of a price premium over other oils, but rape meal benefitted from feed industry demand for the winter season.</p>
<p>Rapeseed buyers at points other than Hamburg were no longer in the market for Dec, which was at 445-462.50 marks last week.</p>
<p>Jan buyers were in a 440-460 marks range, off 2.50 on the week. January buyers of French seed fob Moselle were at 1,520 francs, off 20 from last week.</p>
<p>German August 1997 buyers were broadly steady in a 415-435 marks range.</p>
<p>Trade buyers struck contracts with farmers for the 1997 crop at 395-410 free traders' stores and crushers agreed contracts with traders free mill at 430, but volumes were slim.</p>
<p>On the Matif, February was untraded in a 447/449 bid/offer range, with May unchanged at 448 and Aug down three at 425.</p>
<p>Local Dec rape meal sellers (34 percent protein) were steady on the week per 100 kg at 31.00-31.25 marks, with Jan a touch firmer at 30.50 and Feb-April unchanged at 29.25.</p>
<p>Local Jan rape oil sellers were down 1.75 marks/100 kg at 82.25 while Feb/April oil was down 1.25 at 83.75.</p>
