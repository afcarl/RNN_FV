UNITED NATIONS 1996-12-06

U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali will give clearance for the start of Iraqi oil sales Monday, completing the implementation of the oft-delayed oil-for-food accord signed May 20, a senior U.N. official said Friday.

"Sales can start the next day (Tuesday). I know the draft is already in the process of being written. I would put my money that the report will come out Monday," said the official.
