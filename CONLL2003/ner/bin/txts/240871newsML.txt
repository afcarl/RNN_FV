Siemens says Mauss flap hurts Colombia bid.

BONN 1996-12-06

The controversy over Werner Mauss, the German consultant accused of paying a ransom in Colombia, has dimmed Siemens AG's hopes for a major contract there, a Siemens spokesman said on Friday.

Colombia has put a freeze on an 80 million mark ($52.3 million) tender for the modernisation of a computerised registry system for residents in which Siemens was bidding, the spokesman said.

Mauss is in detention in Colombia on suspicion of paying a ransom to get a German kidnap victim freed. Colombia has made ransom payments illegal in an effort to dry up rebels' funds.

It accuses Mauss of being a member of the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas.

The Siemens spokesman said Mauss had done business for Siemens in the past, including securing the release of a Siemens worker held hostage in Lebanon in the 1980s. He also helped Siemens win a contract for a suburban train in Medellin.

But the spokesman said he was unaware whether Siemens had used Mauss's services in the Colombian registration system bid.

It was not immediately clear whether the contract award had already been decided, but Siemens believed it had had good chances against a pack of U.S. competitors, he said.
