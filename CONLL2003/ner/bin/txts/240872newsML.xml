<p>A widening rift between the German government and the nation's employers over social and labour reforms has made nearly unachievable Chancellor Helmut Kohl's goal of halving unemployment by the year 2000, industry officials and economists said on Friday.</p>
<p>Despite a return to economic growth and a positive outlook on corporate profits next year, Germany's recovery threatens to pass by the growing jobless ranks just as the latest data show 10.7 percent unemployment, a post-war record of 4.1 million.</p>
<p>The government has little room for manoeuvre as it cuts state spending in a bid to meet the strict fiscal targets for Europe's single currency as set out in the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>And because of high labour costs and taxes, German industry is not using its increased profits to create jobs at home, but is increasingly investing abroad in neighboring, low-wage countries in eastern Europe or to be closer to markets in Asia.</p>
<p>As a result, Kohl's efforts to rope industry into a plan to create more than two million jobs over the next five years in exchange for slashing corporate taxes appears to be failing as each side blames the other for steadily rising unemployment.</p>
<p>&quot;There will have to be a powerful effort on the part of all political parties, industry and trade unions and the population if this aim is still to succeed,&quot; said Horst Siebert, one of Kohl's independent economic advisors.</p>
<p>&quot;But at the moment this does not seem likely,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Industry points the finger at Bonn's missed opportunities to cut the fat from Germany's bloated social welfare system or to pass laws to lower the cost of labour.</p>
<p>In a demonstration of discontent over the direction of government policies, the presidents of Germany's leading industry associations went before reportes on Friday to demand tax cuts and more sweeping social reforms.</p>
<p>Hans Peter Stihl, president of the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHT), told journalists that industry was willing to do its part, but urged the government not to pass weak legislative reforms that have little impact in the end.</p>
<p>&quot;The planned tax reform, if radically implemented, will be an epochal work to strengthen Germany as an industrial centre and create more jobs,&quot; he told a news conference in Bonn.</p>
<p>The head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), Hans Olaf Henkel, said he did not want to give up the goal of halving unemployment levels over the next five years, but complained that government was tying industry's hands.</p>
<p>&quot;We would really like to celebrate more ground-breaking ceremonies in Germany and hire people. But in regard to costs and taxes the conditions to do this do not yet exist,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But while the employers complain about the slow pace of political change, they caved in to union pressure this week and struck a wage deal in Lower Saxony state that failed to take advantage of a recently-passed law that would allow businesses to cut sick-pay benefits to 80 percent of normal pay.</p>
<p>The deal was seen as positive because it concluded a moderate pay rise. But it signals the defeat of employers' efforts to reduce the cost of labour by cutting sick pay from 100 percent of wages as guaranteed in existing contracts.</p>
<p>The latest setback for employers comes after the collapse earlier this year of the &quot;Alliance for Jobs&quot; that would have exchanged low wage agreements for job guarantees.</p>
<p>Friedhelm Ost, the economic affairs expert for Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) in parliament, reflected the government's growing frustration with German industry leaders, telling German radio it made no sense to just pass the buck.</p>
<p>He said government and opposition politicians in Bonn just reached a &quot;real breakthrough&quot; by agreeing not to replace a tax on corporate wealth that will expire at the end of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The most sincere desire of German businessmen has been achieved and they are already making new demands,&quot; he said.</p>
