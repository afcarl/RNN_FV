Unions tell Arthuis to quit in French Foncier saga.

Trade unions fighting plans to wind down French property lender Credit Foncier called on Friday for the resignation of Finance Minister Jean Arthuis, alleging a conflict of interest.

The six unions alleged there was a conflict between his role as minister and as a partner in a private accounting firm which had audited the accounts of Credit Foncier subsidiaries in the past.

"For these reasons, we are seeking the immediate resignation of Jean Arthuis, who cannot play both sides of the fence in the Credit Foncier case" the unions said in a joint statement.

Arthuis announced plans in July for a "managed wind-down" of Credit Foncier after the property loans group announced losses of 10.8 billion francs ($2.1 billion), saying there was no other option.

Unions and some politicians have mounted a campaign against the wind-down, saying the group's core business is viable and that the 1995 accounts were overloaded with losses and charges.

Their campaign gained fresh momentum last week when Credit Foncier chairman Jerome Meyssonier said the group was headed for a profit of one billion francs in 1996 after making more than 400 million francs in the first six months.

The statement from the unions on Friday sought to capitalise on the troubles of a government already accused of mismanaging the privatisations of state electronics group Thomson SA and CIC bank. Both sell-offs were suspended recently.

The finance ministry press office said it had not yet seen the union statement and there was no immediate reaction.

The unions said the accounting firm in which Arthuis is a partner had been involved in auditing the accounts of Credit Foncier subsidiary Compagnie Fonciere de Construction as far back as 1987.

"This is about three units which registered the most disastrous results of the Credit Foncier group," their statement said.

"The Compagnie Fonciere de Construction cost Credit Foncier nearly 900 million francs without any action by the Jean Arthuis consultancy," it said. "What secrets are being smothered in trying to kill Credit Foncier?".

A official of the CFDT union contacted by Reuters said that the unions were now hoping they could convince Prime Minister Alain Juppe to put the wind-down plan on hold and consider alternatives, including recapitalising the group.

A recapitalisation of three billion francs would solve the solvency troubles of a group whose shareholder funds were negative to the tune of 2.6 billion francs but which was otherwise making a profit on its basic business, he said.

"The problem of shareholder funds is not unresolvable," the official said, adding that unions had met advisers of Juppe last week and would meet them again on Monday.

The state-owned bank Caisse de Depots et Consignations (CDC) has made a takeover offer for Credit Foncier at a cost of up to 2.7 billion francs on the orders of Arthuis as a prelude to winding the group down.

An announcement due on Monday is expected to show that the offer has been successful.

The opponents of the wind-down hope they can get the process halted at that stage and win a stay of execution during which the group could once again look for a buyer or partner and keep the business running. ($ = 5.173 French Francs)
