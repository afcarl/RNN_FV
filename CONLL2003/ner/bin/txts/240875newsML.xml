<p>Trade unions fighting plans to wind down French property lender Credit Foncier called on Friday for the resignation of Finance Minister Jean Arthuis, alleging a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>The six unions alleged there was a conflict between his role as minister and as a partner in a private accounting firm which had audited the accounts of Credit Foncier subsidiaries in the past.</p>
<p>&quot;For these reasons, we are seeking the immediate resignation of Jean Arthuis, who cannot play both sides of the fence in the Credit Foncier case&quot; the unions said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>Arthuis announced plans in July for a &quot;managed wind-down&quot; of Credit Foncier after the property loans group announced losses of 10.8 billion francs ($2.1 billion), saying there was no other option.</p>
<p>Unions and some politicians have mounted a campaign against the wind-down, saying the group's core business is viable and that the 1995 accounts were overloaded with losses and charges.</p>
<p>Their campaign gained fresh momentum last week when Credit Foncier chairman Jerome Meyssonier said the group was headed for a profit of one billion francs in 1996 after making more than 400 million francs in the first six months.</p>
<p>The statement from the unions on Friday sought to capitalise on the troubles of a government already accused of mismanaging the privatisations of state electronics group Thomson SA and CIC bank. Both sell-offs were suspended recently.</p>
<p>The finance ministry press office said it had not yet seen the union statement and there was no immediate reaction.</p>
<p>The unions said the accounting firm in which Arthuis is a partner had been involved in auditing the accounts of Credit Foncier subsidiary Compagnie Fonciere de Construction as far back as 1987.</p>
<p>&quot;This is about three units which registered the most disastrous results of the Credit Foncier group,&quot; their statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Compagnie Fonciere de Construction cost Credit Foncier nearly 900 million francs without any action by the Jean Arthuis consultancy,&quot; it said. &quot;What secrets are being smothered in trying to kill Credit Foncier?&quot;.</p>
<p>A official of the CFDT union contacted by Reuters said that the unions were now hoping they could convince Prime Minister Alain Juppe to put the wind-down plan on hold and consider alternatives, including recapitalising the group.</p>
<p>A recapitalisation of three billion francs would solve the solvency troubles of a group whose shareholder funds were negative to the tune of 2.6 billion francs but which was otherwise making a profit on its basic business, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem of shareholder funds is not unresolvable,&quot; the official said, adding that unions had met advisers of Juppe last week and would meet them again on Monday.</p>
<p>The state-owned bank Caisse de Depots et Consignations (CDC) has made a takeover offer for Credit Foncier at a cost of up to 2.7 billion francs on the orders of Arthuis as a prelude to winding the group down.</p>
<p>An announcement due on Monday is expected to show that the offer has been successful.</p>
<p>The opponents of the wind-down hope they can get the process halted at that stage and win a stay of execution during which the group could once again look for a buyer or partner and keep the business running. ($ = 5.173 French Francs)</p>
