Italian consumers seen drinking less espresso.

Italy, home of espresso coffee, could struggle to maintain its annual coffee use of 4.5 million 60-kg bags in 1997 amid prospects of slower consumer spending, a senior Italian coffee trader said.

"It's very hard for us to maintain that level," said Alberto Micucci, general manager of Swiss-based Cofiroasters S.A., the buying arm of large Italian roaster Segafredo Zanetti SpA.

He said in an interview that the growing popularity of soft drinks like colas, particularly among young people, had also taken a toll on coffee.

The demand for coffee in the nation of 60 million people has been growing very slowly in the past years in line with sluggish economic growth, Micucci said.

But he said new worries by taxpayers over a "Eurotax" to be imposed in 1997 to enable Italy to be in the first wave of countries joining Europe's single currency could further depress consumer spending.

The Eurotax, part of the 1997 budget, will seek to raise 12.5 trillion lire or some $8.22 billion in several ways, including a one-off hike in income tax which the government has promised to partly reimburse, starting in 1999. "Even if there is no significant rise in inflation, purchasing power is diminishing compared with three to four years ago," Micucci said.

Italians now drink about a cup or two of espresso a day at coffee shops against four or five cups in the past, he said.

Overall, Italy remains a great coffee-drinking nation though in relative terms, it lags France in per capita consumption.

France consumes about 5.5 million bags of coffee a year.

Cofiroasters imports about 800,000 bags of green coffee a year to feed Segafredo's roasting plants in Italy, France, the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium.

Its Italian units alone roast some 300,000 bags a year.

The company also supplies an undisclosed amount of coffee to other Italian roasters outside the group. After the United States, Italy is the largest buyer of Brazilian coffee, importing some 1.5 million bags a year against 2.1 million bags by the United States, figures from German statistician F.O. Licht show.

Micucci said he sourced mostly Brazil's Santos coffee, which when blended with a good robusta and some washed arabica, makes a good cup of espresso, a short but strong coffee.

He said a shakeout in the Italian coffee sector has seen the number of small indepedent roasters falling by half from 1,000 over the past few years. About three-quarters of the Italian market is controlled by five long-established roasters.
