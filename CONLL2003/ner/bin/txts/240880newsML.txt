Forecasts by German diversified utility Veba AG for a 25 percent increase in net profit for 1996 provide further evidence that strong earnings growth in the German utilities sector is set to run and run.

The group said on Thursday night in Essen that it expected pre-tax profit to rise 15 percent in 1996 and net profit to rise 25 percent from last year's figure of 1.9 billion marks ($1.2 billion).

"We expect that we can repeat the nine-month figures for the whole year," Veba's chief executive, Ulrich Hartmann, said.

One London-based utilty analyst said: "I think Veba can keep up this kind of earnings growth for some time. We can see Veba exceeding ten-percent earnings growth every year for at least the next five years."

Veba shares ended bourse trade down 3.80 marks, or 4.4 percent, at 86.40 marks, slightly less than the overall market.

Asked by journalists if Veba would raise its dividend payout from last year's dividend of 1.70 marks per five mark share, Hartmann said: "I dare not contradict that," while declining to make a more specific comment.

Hartmann also said that Veba's return on equity capital would improve in 1996 from its level last year of 11.4.

"We will make another step this year toward our goal of 15 percent return on equity capital after taxes," said Hartmann

According to analysis on Reuters Securities 3000, a return on equity figure of 15 percent is closer to RoEs at Veba's competitors, with Viag's RoE at 21 percent and RWE's at 17.3 percent.

Meanwhile, Veba's chief financial officer Michael Gaul said that the group would see internal financing clearly climb in the years ahead, despite higher investment, adding that this would help improve the group's financial flexibility, allowing it to take advantage of strategic options.

Veba was one of the earliest proponents of the shareholder value ethos in German industry, but in recent months has sought to distance itself from the shareholder value debate, which it says has focused on job losses over improved investor returns.

Some analysts were more sceptical about the outlook for Veba. "If what we saw in the nine-month figures, that most of Veba's earnings growth came from electricity and exports, then we must draw the conclusion that it is a one-off," said Peter Gyllenbaga, European utilities analyst at CS First Boston.

Analysts said that the fact Gaul was stressing cash-flows indicated that the company was examining options on how to use its cash, which could be a hint at share buy-backs.

"Veba is well positioned among the German utilities. The state sold its last shares in the company ten years ago, which means that Veba has had ten years to adopt a return-oriented policy," said Gyllenbaga.

The London analyst said: "The main growth areas for Veba will be its energy business and its oil business. The oil business will recover as European oil refining margins pick up as overcapacity in the sector is cut back."

He said his comments did not just apply to Veba, but that he was generally bullish on the outlook for the whole German energy sector.

"For the energy sector, despite what many German commentators say, I think competition in the energy sector is good news. Look at what it has done in the U.K. -- costs have been cut back and earnings have increased," the analyst said.

"There are more than one thousand distributors in Germany, which the big utilities are gobbling up -- that's good news. Also, instead of sitting on their cash, utilities are now redirecting into worthwhile non-core areas," the analyst said. ($1=1.5338 Mark)
