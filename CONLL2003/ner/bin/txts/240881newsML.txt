Buba's Jochimsen urges national deal for metal pay.

DUESSELDORF, Germany 1996-12-06

Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen said on Friday he hoped a regional pay deal reached on Thursday in the state of Lower Saxony could be applied across the strife-hit metal and engineering sector.

"I welcome the Lower Saxony agreement, it's a far-sighted solution in which all partners got closer to each other. I hope it will be adopted by the other regions," Jochimsen told a news briefing.

In an unexpected move, regional employers in the northern state of Lower Saxony agreed on Thursday to continue paying workers sick pay at 100 percent of salary, overriding a new law allowing them to cut payments to 80 percent.

The deal was widely seen as raising the chances for an amicable end to the dispute, which many feared would result in all-out strikes across the sector next year.

Under the deal, 90,000 workers in Lower Saxony will also receive a wage increase of 1.5 percent from April, 1997, and a further rise of 2.5 percent from April 1, 1998.

Contracts on sick pay last until 2001. Jochimsen said he was impressed by the long duration of the contracts signed.

Employers said the deal would mean no significant increase in labour costs for the sector next year. They had however been hoping to use the new sick pay law to launch an attack on costs linked to the industry's three million plus workers.

Board members of the central Gesamtmetall sector employers federation are due to meet in Frankfurt this Sunday and are expected to decide whether to recommend the deal to other regional employer representatives.

Jochimsen had earlier warned that Germany's economic recovery was not yet on a solid footing despite recent data showing strong growth in the third quarter.
