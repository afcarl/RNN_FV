ZURICH 1996-12-06

The Alusuisse-Lonza Group said its chemicals division would invest 36 million Swiss francs in the construction of an additional multipurpose plant at its Visp Fine Chemicals Complex.

The new plant, where high-quality fine chemicals will be produced, is scheduled to come on stream in the summer of 1998, Alusuisse said in a statement.

The fine chemicals complex, which has been gradually expanded since 1984, produces custom syntheses of intermediates and active ingredients for pharmaceuticals, plant protection agents and special polymers.

Given the current broad product portfolio in the research and development pipeline, Alusuisse's Lonza division anticipates strong growth of the custom syntheses business.
