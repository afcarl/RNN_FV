German stocks may still brighten Yuletide-analysts.

Germans may still end up decking their halls with boughs of money, despite the steep dive in the country's stock market on Friday.

Even after the blue-chip DAX index fell more than four percent -- its sharpest one-day slide in five years -- German shares have enough strength to deliver a Merry Christmas and possibly a Happy New Year, analysts said.

"The bourse still has upward momentum because profits are still climbing in Germany and the German market as a whole could become even more attractive if other markets fall," said Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at Bank Julius Baer Frankfurt.

Equity analyst Andrew Bell of BZW in London agreed.

"This is a healthy correction. People are not running for the exits," he told Reuters Financial Television.

The 30-share DAX index closed bourse trade at 2,791.96 on Friday, over four percent down on the day but well above its intra-day low of 2,760.76.

The index recovered to around 2,820 points in afternoon computer-based trade in response to weaker than expected U.S. jobs data, which reduced market fears about the U.S. economy.

The slide was a rude awakening for the market, which only a day earlier had closed above 2,900 points for the first time, after forging more than 100 points higher in the week.

Even after today's fall, the DAX is still about 25 percent up on the year.

The dip below 2,800 points, the first since November 22, marked the index's biggest fall since the shock from Russia's August 1991 coup against Mikhail Gorbachev.

"We had risen too fast and overheated, and some profit-taking and consolidation can only be healthy for the market," Grebe said.

The fall in German stocks followed comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan that central banks had to beware of "irrational euphoria" in recent stock and bond gains.

Investors sold off dollars in response, and Asian markets fell sharply, with the key Nikkei 225 index dropping more than three percent.

Reimut Jochimsen, president of the state central bank in North Rhine-Westphalia, further unsettled markets when he said the German economy had no basis for self-sustaining growth. He also saw no need to prop up the economy with monetary policy.

Hardest hit on the DAX were export-heavy shares such as the chemical groups.

Bayer AG was down seven percent to 60.50 marks, BASF AG off six percent 57.55 and Hoechst AG down 4.7 percent to 66.80.

Industrial group Mannesmann AG, which rose on Thursday on rumours of a telecommunications alliance, fell back five percent to 643 marks.

Meanwhile, German government bonds extended a tumble begun late on Thursday on a sell-off of U.S. debt, as Greenspan's comments compounded concerns. But the market was supported by dealers' view that Germany, a traditional safe-haven for capital, could benefit from outflows from other European bonds.

As losses hit markets all across Europe, and investors braced for more bad news on Wall Street, analysts dismissed fears German markets would continue to fall longer-term.

"Optimism is giving way to realism," Thomas Tilse, equity analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, told Reuters Financial Television.

"We should expect the market to grow 3.5 percent next year rather than the more than 20 percent we have seen this year. It will be a difficult year, but not a time for crashes," he said.
