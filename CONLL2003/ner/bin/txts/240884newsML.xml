<p>Germans may still end up decking their halls with boughs of money, despite the steep dive in the country's stock market on Friday.</p>
<p>Even after the blue-chip DAX index fell more than four percent -- its sharpest one-day slide in five years -- German shares have enough strength to deliver a Merry Christmas and possibly a Happy New Year, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The bourse still has upward momentum because profits are still climbing in Germany and the German market as a whole could become even more attractive if other markets fall,&quot; said Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at Bank Julius Baer Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Equity analyst Andrew Bell of BZW in London agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a healthy correction. People are not running for the exits,&quot; he told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index closed bourse trade at 2,791.96 on Friday, over four percent down on the day but well above its intra-day low of 2,760.76.</p>
<p>The index recovered to around 2,820 points in afternoon computer-based trade in response to weaker than expected U.S. jobs data, which reduced market fears about the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>The slide was a rude awakening for the market, which only a day earlier had closed above 2,900 points for the first time, after forging more than 100 points higher in the week.</p>
<p>Even after today's fall, the DAX is still about 25 percent up on the year.</p>
<p>The dip below 2,800 points, the first since November 22, marked the index's biggest fall since the shock from Russia's August 1991 coup against Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p>&quot;We had risen too fast and overheated, and some profit-taking and consolidation can only be healthy for the market,&quot; Grebe said.</p>
<p>The fall in German stocks followed comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan that central banks had to beware of &quot;irrational euphoria&quot; in recent stock and bond gains.</p>
<p>Investors sold off dollars in response, and Asian markets fell sharply, with the key Nikkei 225 index dropping more than three percent.</p>
<p>Reimut Jochimsen, president of the state central bank in North Rhine-Westphalia, further unsettled markets when he said the German economy had no basis for self-sustaining growth. He also saw no need to prop up the economy with monetary policy.</p>
<p>Hardest hit on the DAX were export-heavy shares such as the chemical groups.</p>
<p>Bayer AG was down seven percent to 60.50 marks, BASF AG off six percent 57.55 and Hoechst AG down 4.7 percent to 66.80.</p>
<p>Industrial group Mannesmann AG, which rose on Thursday on rumours of a telecommunications alliance, fell back five percent to 643 marks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, German government bonds extended a tumble begun late on Thursday on a sell-off of U.S. debt, as Greenspan's comments compounded concerns. But the market was supported by dealers' view that Germany, a traditional safe-haven for capital, could benefit from outflows from other European bonds.</p>
<p>As losses hit markets all across Europe, and investors braced for more bad news on Wall Street, analysts dismissed fears German markets would continue to fall longer-term.</p>
<p>&quot;Optimism is giving way to realism,&quot; Thomas Tilse, equity analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>&quot;We should expect the market to grow 3.5 percent next year rather than the more than 20 percent we have seen this year. It will be a difficult year, but not a time for crashes,&quot; he said.</p>
