   Petrofina  Oil and Chemicals  *10,700    Vermeulen Raemdonck

COMMENT: We have upgraded our EPS forecast for 1997 from 700 to 730 Belgian francs. We confirm our buy signal for the share which trades at 14.7 times 1997 earnings versus 15 for the sector in Europe.

We believe the share deserves a premium as the company is better positioned than its competitors in the refining sector (75 percent of sales) in view of tighter regulations (to be imposed).

Recommendation: BUY.
