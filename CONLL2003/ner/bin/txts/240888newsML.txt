Dutch see offshore airport as Schiphol replacement.

AMSTERDAM 1996-12-06

The Netherlands' national airport at Schiphol could be moved to a man-made island in the North Sea, a report by the Dutch national resources and demographics institute(RPD) said on Friday.

It added that an artificial island is the most logical location for a new national airport.

The report was prepared for the Dutch planning ministry.

The RPD said moving Schiphol would avoid the need for a second national airport.

The report is intended as an advisory document ahead of a review of airport capacity due in to start in March next year.

The proposal is one way of achieving improved long term growth for the airport and of reducing environmental objections to further expansion of the existing airport, it added.

The report also examined a number of other options including boosting current capacity at Schiphol, the construction of a satellite airport and a third option, of building a second national airport offshore. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017
