<headline>Durch overnight rates continue Thursday's rise.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Most Dutch money market rates seemed unaffected by the bond market's slide on Friday, remaining stable in disorderly pre-weekend trade.</p>
<p>Only call money was significantly up, quoting 2.81 to 2.94, while most deals were done at 2.87, some 20 basis points higher than on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the rise (in call money) is due to a tight allocation, although some players may have subscribed for a too small amount and may now be pushing the call up,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>He said the main part of the rise was probably due to the pre-weekend effect, referring to the usual rise in overnight guilders ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p>This morning, the central bank allocated 7.455 billion guilders to the money market under a seven-day special advances pact at an unchanged rate of 2.50 percent. The pact replaced an eight-day facility of 6.47 billion guilders which expired today.</p>
<p>The flurry on the surrounding bond markets did not seem to have a significant effect on Dutch money market rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, a lot of money is going out of bonds, especially from investment funds, but I don't see it flowing into the money market at the moment,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>As bond deals are settled three working days after they are done, he said he did not expect a big impact from this pullout of bonds on the money market before next week.</p>
<p>&quot;If it is going towards the money market at all,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One-year deposits were quoted 3.20/28, up from 3.16/24 yesterday.</p>
<p>Trade was concentrated on overnight money and one-month deposits, dealers said.</p>
<p>The guilder held steady against the mark, quoting 112.17 per 100 marks, as it did on Thursday.</p>
