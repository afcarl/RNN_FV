Swiss Q3 GDP fell 0.7 percent - banking sources.

ZURICH 1996-12-06

The Swiss Federal Office for Economic Policy will report on Tuesday that third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.7 percent after a provisional 0.9 percent second-quarter drop, banking sources said.

The data are due for official release only next week, but the office, a division of the economics ministry, routinely circulates them under embargo to bank economists and economic institutes ahead of publication, the sources said.

"This has been going on for years," one source said.

The numbers are provided in advance to allow the banks and institutes to prepare analysis and analytical commentary ahead of the announced released date, the sources said.

This time they found their way into the markets, but have had no major impact.

An economics office official confirmed that the data has for some time been circulated in such a manner to allow economists more time to analyse the data.

"I can confirm this," said Andre Schwaller of the Office for Economic Policy. "It is handled in such a way that certain circles and people get this information in advance, the Centre for Research of Economic Activity as well," he said.

He was referring to the KOF economic think tank, one of Switzerland's top forecasting institutes.

He could not say whether people informed in advance were able to profit from their knowledge, adding: "Not as such because all banks are treated in the same way. In this regard, no one is better off than the others."

All banks operating here would be included in this system, and not just Swiss banks, he said. "Swiss banks are not given preference," he added.

He said the system aims to give institutions the chance to keep publications that require weeks of preparation up to date.

"The people who look after these publications are supposed to keep the data to themselves, but I can now see it is apparent this information is going in different directions and I suspect we will have to consider how this is handled, Schwaller said.

He said his office had not encountered any problems in the past. "This is apparently the first time a problem has arisen. Someone has not stuck to the rules of the game."

The Swiss system complies with guidelines drawn up by the International Monetary Fund and posted on the Internet on the Dissimination Standards Bulletin Board.

The Web site (HTTP://DSBB.IMF.ORG) opened in April 1996 to guide members that wish to access capital markets.

"Data are made available under strict conditions, to the Minister of Economy, the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the National Bank, the Swiss Council of Economic Advisers (KFK) and national forecasting institutions (including reserach divisions of accredited banks) some days ahead of press release," it says on the page.

"Data are provided to the press and to the interested public on an embargo basis by postal mailing the day before and by fax the day of release," it adds.
