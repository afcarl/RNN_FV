German feed mixers warn customers of rising costs.

BONN 1996-12-06

Rising global protein feed prices were raising feed mixers' costs and could bring higher product prices, German feeds industry association FFMI said in a written statement on Friday.

"Mixed feed prices may have to be raised...especially as there are no factors pointing to weaker raw materials prices over the next few weeks," the statement said.

"The only relief comes from stable feed grain prices and this will mean a high degree of grains use in feed mixes will be maintained."

Soymeal was priced at up to 470 marks a tonne depending on customers' location, when four weeks ago the top price was 410, FFMI noted. It cost 440 marks fob ex Hamburg mills today for December.

Citing Chinese buying in the U.S. for the price strength, FFMI added other oil cakes and protein feeds had risen in sympathy with soymeal.

Argentine sun meal pellets had risen to 240 marks free European sea port from 220 marks a month ago.

Citrus pellets, germ meal and domestic rape meal prices were also firm.

Demand was strong because consumers had some gaps in their winter cover, FFMI said. -Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275
