<p>Rising global protein feed prices were raising feed mixers' costs and could bring higher product prices, German feeds industry association FFMI said in a written statement on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Mixed feed prices may have to be raised...especially as there are no factors pointing to weaker raw materials prices over the next few weeks,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The only relief comes from stable feed grain prices and this will mean a high degree of grains use in feed mixes will be maintained.&quot;</p>
<p>Soymeal was priced at up to 470 marks a tonne depending on customers' location, when four weeks ago the top price was 410, FFMI noted. It cost 440 marks fob ex Hamburg mills today for December.</p>
<p>Citing Chinese buying in the U.S. for the price strength, FFMI added other oil cakes and protein feeds had risen in sympathy with soymeal.</p>
<p>Argentine sun meal pellets had risen to 240 marks free European sea port from 220 marks a month ago.</p>
<p>Citrus pellets, germ meal and domestic rape meal prices were also firm.</p>
<p>Demand was strong because consumers had some gaps in their winter cover, FFMI said. -Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275</p>
