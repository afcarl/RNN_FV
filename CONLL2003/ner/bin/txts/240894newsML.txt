Munich Re - DAX status boosted share vols.

MUNICH, Germany 1996-12-06

Muenchener Rueckversicherungs AG, the world's largest reinsurer, said on Friday that its inclusion in the DAX index this year sharply boosted its share trading volumes.

Management board chairman Hans-Juergen Schinzler told the annual shareholders meeting that trading volumes in Munich Re's registered shares increased four-fold since they joined the DAX in late September.

He also predicted that the company's stock split, planned for late next year, could boost volumes further. Schinzler said the split would cost around one million marks.

Munich Re's registered shares joined the DAX after an annual reshuffle of the index components which ousted tyre maker Continental AG to make room for the reinsurer and also agreed to drop Metallgesellschaft AG in favour of Deutsche Telekom.

Munich Re, whose stock was considered relatively illiquid, had campaigned for years for inclusion in the DAX mainly on the basis of its status in world insurance.

Munich Re's registered shares, the most expensive on the DAX, closed bourse dealings at 3,680 marks on Friday.

The planned 10-for-one stock split would reduce the par value of Munich Re's shares to five marks from 50, causing their price to drop to around one tenth of the present value.
