French privatisation to continue -Lamassoure.

PARIS 1996-12-06

France's privatisation programme will continue, despite hiccups with the sale of Thomson SA and CIC bank, budget minister Alain Lamassoure said.

"We are determined to continue the privatisation programme despite the events of the recent days. It is easier to sell companies that make money than those that have debts," he said during a magazine prize award ceremony.

Lamassoure said that the sale of state companies proved France had ditched an old approach of centrally guided capitalism and was getting more in line with the Anglo-Saxon model of capitalism.
