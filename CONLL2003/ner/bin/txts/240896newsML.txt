Paris and Bonn may discuss budget pact at summit.

PARIS 1996-12-06

French Foreign Ministry Spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said on Friday that the issue of the so-called budget "stability pact" would probably be discussed at an upcoming Franco-German summit in Nuremberg, Germany.

He said an announcement of a deal on the pact, over which Germany and France have been at odds, was unlikely at the summit on December 9 since it required the approval of all 15 members of the European Union.

"If there are differences, they will be discussed since the will of both (countries) is to reach an accord and all these meetings mark progress, maybe not as fast as some would wish, but each time it goes in the direction of rapprochement," Rummelhardt told reporters at a briefing.

Diplomats have said Paris and Bonn have reached agreement on the issue, meant to impose budget discipline on members of a single European currency.

They have suggested Germany would eventually settle on less strict terms for automatic fines when countries overshoot Maastricht Treaty budget deficit targets.
