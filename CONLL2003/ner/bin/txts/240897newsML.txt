Austrian shares hammered after U.S. warning.

VIENNA 1996-12-06

Austrian shares slumped to a one-week low on Friday, hurt by declines on Europe's main markets after U.S. central bank chief Alan Greenspan suggested a recent stock rally in the U.S. might have been overdone.

Traders said the ATX could retrace further below the key psychological 1,100 point level unless U.S. markets staged a strong recovery later on Friday. "There's no way of telling where we're heading before Wall Street opens," said one.

The ATX index of 21 blue chips fell 22.56 points or 1.99 percent to close at 1,108.40, up from the day's low of 1,102.34, marking its biggest one-day decline in almost three months. All but two of its constituents fell.

"That was the fear of a crash in America," said a trader. "But compared to some other markets, we held out pretty well."

Leading shares in Germany had plunged more than four percent before recovering slightly on the back of better-than-expected U.S. payfarm data.

Chip-maker Austria Mikro Systeme, or AMS, led the day's decliners in Vienna, slumping 5.95 percent to 790 schillings, wiping out most of the advances racked up over the past two weeks as investors regained confidence in the long-term profitability of the semiconductor maker.

Shares of steel maker VA Stahl were the day's most actively traded issue, falling 2.45 percent to 381 schillings on volume of 76,000 shares ahead of nine-month results due on Monday.

Outside the main market, shares of automobile maker Steyr-Daimler-Puch rose three schillings, or 1.9 percent, at 160 schillings after the firm announced on Thursday it would assemble Chrysler Cherokee Jeeps for a further six years, an order worth some 10 billion schillings in aggregate sales.

The broad Vienna bourse index fell 5.87 points to 422.71.

On the Vienna futures and options exchange, ATX contracts for December delivery slumped 27.0 points to 1,103.0.
