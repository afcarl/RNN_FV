Petrofina  Oil and Chemicals  10,700   Vermeulen Raemdonck

COMMENT: We have upgraded our EPS forecast for 1997 from 700 to 730 Belgian francs. We confirm our   buy signal for the

share which trades at 14.7 times 1997 earnings vs. 15 for the sector in Europe. We believe the share deserves a perium as the companyis better positioned than its competitors in the refining sector (75 percent of sales) in view of tighter regulations.

Recommendation: BUY.
