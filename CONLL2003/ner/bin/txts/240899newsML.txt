Swiss Re says 1996 premium volume up.

ZURICH 1996-12-06

Swiss Reinsurance Co said premium volumes would finish 1996 two percent higher at 13 billion Swiss francs, although major currency exchange rate fluctuations could still have a strong impact.  

"We anticipate a slight decrease in premium development measured in original currencies," a Swiss Re statement said.

"In comparison to the previous year, however, various major currencies have gained against the Swiss franc; we therefore expect a premium volume of 13 billion Swiss francs, representing an increase of two percent," the reinsurer said.

Swiss Re added that large fluctuations in the remainder of the year could still have a strong influence on premiums.
