Swiss Re sees higher 1996 result.

ZURICH 1996-12-06

Swiss Reinsurance Co said it expected 1996 after-tax profit to rise significantly more than 20 percent from the year before, excluding the acquisition of Merchant & General Re.  

The world's second biggest reinsurance group, and world leader in life business, Swiss Re said it was confident for 1997 but did not elaborate.

"Overall, we anticipate that results after tax will increase by significantly more than 20 percent compared with last year, excluding the acquisition of M&G Re," a Swiss Re statement said.

Swiss Re posted an ordinary net profit of 1,092 million Swiss francs, a 54 percent rise from the year before.

The purchase of M&G Re from Prudential of Britain will cost 1.704 billion sterling or about 3.15 billion Swiss francs, Swiss Re said when the deal was announced in August.  

Swiss Re said its investment portfolio had performed well.

"The return on investment for 1996 had already exceeded that of the 1995 business year (2,605 million Swiss francs) by the end of October," it said.

"We expect the underwriting result for the current business year to improve slightly on 1995," Swiss Re added.

It said the year had once again seen an abscence of major natural catastrophes and lartge individual claims.

"Assuming this remains the case, we will be able to strengthen the provision for catastrophe and major losses substantially," it said.  

Swiss Re said the acquisition of M&G Re would contribute to achieving its targeted returns. It had said in August M&G Re would help it reach a return on equity of 15 percent.

"In view of developments in the reinsurance market, the acquisition of M&G Re, Swiss Re's market position and the measures which we have implemented to increase earnings, we are confident for 1997, although performance depends largely on major claims experience and developments on the financial markets," it said.

A Swiss Re spokesman said M&G Re would not be consolidated in the 1996 profit and loss account due to the short time remaining in the year.

But M&G Re will be fully consolidated on the balance sheet as of December 31, 1996.

"We expect investments at balance-sheet value to rise more than 54 million Swiss francs," the spokesman said.

Capital funds at balance-sheet value should amount to about nine billion Swiss francs after goodwill for M&G Re, he said.
