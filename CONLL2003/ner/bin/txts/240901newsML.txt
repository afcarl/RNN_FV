Swiss Re completes M&G acquisition.

ZURICH 1996-12-06

Swiss Reinsurance Co. said it had completed its acquisition of Mercantile and General Re (M&G Re) from Prudential Corp. following the granting of all regulatory approvals.  

Swiss Re agreed to acquire M&G at the end of August for 1.7 billion sterling, marking an important step for Swiss Re in the life and health reinsurance business.

Swiss Re noted that 1.7 billion sterling was the equivalent of 3.2 billion Swiss francs, but at current exchange rates it would be 3.6 billion francs.

"As is customary for such transactions in the insurance industry, the acquisition was subject to regulatory approval in various countries. All approvals have been granted, and the acquisition of the company is now complete," Swiss Re said.

M&G, a reinsurance company based in London, expects to record a premium volume of 1.4 billion sterling in 1996 (3.0 billion Swiss francs), up from 1.3 billion sterling in 1995.

Almost 80 percent of M&G's business is written in the life and health reinsurance sector and the move made Swiss Re the world's leading reinsurer in this sector.
