EU farmers oppose review of world trade pact.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

The European Union must block any move by its trade partners at a meeting in Singapore next week to renegotiate the world farm trade agreement, European farmers said on Friday.

The Australian-led Cairns Group of agricultural free trading nations is expected to press at the first ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation to reopen the pact signed in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 1994.

A review of the agreement is not scheduled until 1999.

"The EU must firmly oppose any such attempt," COPA, the EU farmers' organisation, said in a statement.

Implementation of sanitary and phytosanitary measures as well as technical barriers to trade should instead be clarified, it added.

Work on establishing and extending international and social standards must also be speeded up.
