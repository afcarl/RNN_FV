BW-Bank plans capital rise in early 1997.

STUTTGART, Germany 1996-12-06

Baden Wuerttembergische Bank AG (BW-Bank) said on Friday it planned to increase its capital by a nominal 15 million marks at the start of 1997, in a bid to raise 105 million marks.

The bank said shareholders would be offered new shares in a ratio of one-for-11 at 350 marks per share. Its shares closed bourse dealings at 585 marks on Friday.

The shares would be eligible for full 1997 dividends, the bank said.

The bank also said it would issue participation certificates worth 100 million marks, offered in a ratio of one-for-33.

The offer period will run from mid-February through the start of March 1997.

BW said the increase was designed to give it a basis for further growth.
