German share suffer biggest drop in five years.

FRANKFURT 1996-12-04

The German DAX index of top shares dived on Friday to end bourse trade down over four percent, the biggest loss since a nine percent tumble on the 1991 coup against former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

The fall came after overnight comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, hinting at concerns over the recent steep gains in the U.S. financial market.

Greenspan said the Federal Reserve had to be wary of "irrational exuberance" affecting stock and other asset markets.

The DAX index ended down 4.05 percent, or 117.95 points, at 2,791.96 points, coming off an early low of 2,760.76, which had represented a fall of over five percent.

The fall wiped out two weeks of gains on the DAX in one fell swoop.

In mid-August 1991, the index had fallen 9.3 percent following the coup in Moscow. This year the largest bourse fall came on July 16, when the index dropped 3.17 percent following a sharp dive on Wall Street.

But despite the speed of the fall some analysts and players said the market had long been due for a downward correction and said the upward trend in Germany was still intact.

"We had risen too fast and overheated, and some profit-taking and consolidation can only be healthy for the market," said Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt.

"In Europe and particularly in Germany we have a completely different scenario. We still have no inflation danger and in terms of economic recovery we are two years behins the U.S," said Grebe.

The market was not only discouraged by Greenspan's comments, which Wall Street will only have a chance to react to this afternoon, but also by a fall in the dollar to around 1.53 marks and comments by a Bundesbank council member.

Reimut Jochimsen said on Friday that he saw no need for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth, dampening hopes for any further German interest rate cuts and sending German bond downwards.

But at the same time, Jochimsen said the German economy was not on solid base for sustained growth.

The dollar's strength earlier this week to 23-month highs above 1.57 marks, had boosted the German DAX to all-time record highs above 2,900 points.

The DAX index had ended bourse dealings on Thursday at a record closing high of 2,909.91 points.

"The biggest gainers of the past few days are now the biggest losers because of the dollar's fall," said one trader.

The strong rally in German stocks in recent days had been powered by the export-oriented chemicals sector in particular, which tumbled on Friday .

Shares in chemical firm Bayer AG was the biggest DAX loser, ending down nearly seven percent at 60.50 marks, while BASF AG dropped 6.35 percent to 57.55 marks.
