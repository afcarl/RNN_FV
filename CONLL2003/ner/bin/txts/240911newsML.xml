<headline>Israel's Peres favours NATO in Mideast talks.</headline>

<p>Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said on Friday he believed NATO should be represented in Middle East peace talks.</p>
<p>&quot;Europe says it no longer wants to be only a banker for the peace process without being associated with it. I believe there should be an Atlantic (Alliance) team in these negotiations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Peres, visiting the Council of Europe, was referring to controversy over Europe's role in the process which flared when French President Jacques Chirac sought in October to include the European Union, together with the United States, as a mediator.</p>
<p>Israel rejected the suggestion.</p>
<p>Peres described the establishment of new Israeli settlements in occupied Arab areas as a &quot;tragic error&quot; though he added that the Oslo agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority did not specifically ban them.</p>
<p>He said the peace process was irreversible though &quot;it would cost more and take longer&quot; under Israel's present right-wing leadership.</p>
<p>Peres rejected the notion of a national unity cabinet &quot;unless it included a joint common programme for peace.&quot;</p>
