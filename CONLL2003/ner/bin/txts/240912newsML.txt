French stocks cut losses after U.S. jobs data.

PARIS 1996-12-06

French shares cut losses after the publication of U.S. jobs data, showing an 118,000 increase in payrolls which was less than expected, was seen as a good sign.

The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 67.34 points or 2.92 percent at 2,225.54 at 1332 GMT while the CAC-40 futures contract was down at 2,225 from 2,294 on Thursday's close.

The CAC-40 had hit a day low of 2,180.44.  

* Volume was a high 7.25 billion francs, of which 5.8 billion in blue chip shares.

* The market had plunged from the opening on the back of comments made by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, during a dinner in Washington after Wall Street had closed, warning markets of "irrational exuberance".

The market also suffered from later comments by Bundesbank member Jochimsen saying that there was no need for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth and that the German economy was not yet strong enough for self-sustained growth.  

Market analysts said they had expected a correction because Paris was close to historic highs, but they had not expected the sell-off to be a steep as this morning.

Analysts at Paribas, CSFB and J.P Morgan said their end-year target for the CAC-40 remained 2,200.

"December is not going to be brilliant. The market is still expensive when compared with other markets and there at no signs of any recovery in economic fundamentals that would justify the profit expectations," said Jean-Luc de Lamaze, an analyst who follows the French market for CSFB in London.  

"Recently there have been uncertainties on the monetary front and the Thomson decision has damanged the country's reputation in the eyes of investors," he added.

"There is a feeling that there is a social blockade and that does not entice investors, they will keep outside the market," De Lamaze said.

" The Greenspan comments were an excuse to take profits," said Gary Dugan, French equity analyst at JP Morgan in London.

"In Paris we had been trading some seven to eight percent above the 90-day moving average and we were expecting a correction," he said.  

An analyst at Paribas said that even if the job figures were good the market would remain flat and on its toes.

During a dinner at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington on Thursday, Greenspan said that there was a risk that the financial bubble would burst.

"Greenspan sent a clear message to the markets -- 'Gentlemen, you are overdoing it, restrain yourselves.' He is puncturing the speculative bubble that fuelled New York and other markets," one dealer said.
