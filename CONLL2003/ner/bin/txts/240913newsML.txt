LISBON 1996-12-06

The privatisation of 65 percent of state tobacco concern Tabaqueira-Empresa Industrial de Tabacos should be on the agenda of the next cabinet meeting on Thursday, December 12, Economy Minister Augusto Mateus told Reuters.

"On Monday, I hope to finalise my report which has only to do with the competitive aspects," he said.

"After that, it will go to the cabinet for a decision," he said, adding that if a decision were taken at the cabinet session, there would still be time for the privatisation to be carried out this year.

Three foreign-led consortiums -- Spain's Tabacalera, Philip Morris and French group Seita -- are bidding for Tabaqueira.

The country's competition council has already ruled that all three bids are acceptable under competition rules.
