S&P reaffirms Henkel ratings.

FRANKFURT 1996-12-06

U.S. ratings agency Standard & Poor's on Friday said it has taken German chemicals group Henkel KGaA off its CreditWatch and affirmed its ratings for commercial paper and senior unsecured debt.

It affirmed Henkel's commercial paper at A-1+ and senior unsecured debt at AA- after the group on Thursday announced it would acquire the remaining 65 percent of adhesives group Loctite Corp it does not yet own.

"The rating affirmation reflects that from a business perspective, the acquisition of Loctite, one of Henkel's largest competitors, strongly reinforces Henkel's global number one position in both industrial and consumer adhesives," the rating agency said.

But it said the "ratings have very limited potential for further debt-financed acquisitions over the next few years, and could be reviewed if Henkel's financial profile does not improve as envisaged."

Henkel and Loctite Corp agreed a merger in which Henkel will acquire the 65 percent of Loctite it does not already own for about $1.3 billion, or $61 in cash per share.

The agreement, unanimously approved by Loctite's board, comes five weeks after Henkel first unveiled a proposal to buy Loctite for $56 a share.

Based on Loctite's 32 million shares outstanding, the Henkel merger offer is worth about $1.27 billion.

Loctite makes sealants and coatings, earned $84 million, or $2.40 a share, on revenues of $785 million last year.

One of the conditions that Loctite had required was that its Hartford office remain open for at least two years.
