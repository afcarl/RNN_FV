<headline>S&amp;P reaffirms Henkel ratings.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's on Friday said it has taken German chemicals group Henkel KGaA off its CreditWatch and affirmed its ratings for commercial paper and senior unsecured debt.</p>
<p>It affirmed Henkel's commercial paper at A-1+ and senior unsecured debt at AA- after the group on Thursday announced it would acquire the remaining 65 percent of adhesives group Loctite Corp it does not yet own.</p>
<p>&quot;The rating affirmation reflects that from a business perspective, the acquisition of Loctite, one of Henkel's largest competitors, strongly reinforces Henkel's global number one position in both industrial and consumer adhesives,&quot; the rating agency said.</p>
<p>But it said the &quot;ratings have very limited potential for further debt-financed acquisitions over the next few years, and could be reviewed if Henkel's financial profile does not improve as envisaged.&quot;</p>
<p>Henkel and Loctite Corp agreed a merger in which Henkel will acquire the 65 percent of Loctite it does not already own for about $1.3 billion, or $61 in cash per share.</p>
<p>The agreement, unanimously approved by Loctite's board, comes five weeks after Henkel first unveiled a proposal to buy Loctite for $56 a share.</p>
<p>Based on Loctite's 32 million shares outstanding, the Henkel merger offer is worth about $1.27 billion.</p>
<p>Loctite makes sealants and coatings, earned $84 million, or $2.40 a share, on revenues of $785 million last year.</p>
<p>One of the conditions that Loctite had required was that its Hartford office remain open for at least two years.</p>
