FOCUS - German Colonia sees higher profit.

COLOGNE, Germany 1996-12-06

German insurance group Colonia Konzern AG said on Friday it expected its 1996 net profits to rise at least five percent and promised shareholders that it would pay a higher dividend.

"We will continue our dividend policy with higher pay-outs in 1996," chief executive Claas Kleyboldt told a news briefing in Cologne on Friday.

Colonia, a 68 percent-owned subsidiary of French insurer UAP, said its premium income would grow by some 5.5 percent to 10.7 billion marks ($6.98 billion) in 1996.

Colonia has said before that it expects 1996 profits to be higher than the 210 million marks it made in 1995, but has not quantified how much growth it expected.

The Colonia board said it was confident its 1997 results from its individual group businesses would build on the "very good" results expected this year.

It said, however, it was only expecting moderate premium income growth of around four percent next year.

An improvement in German economic conditions next year would bring "hardly any positive impetus" to the German insurance market.

Colonia increased its 1995 dividend to 15 marks per preference share and 14 marks per ordinary share.

Earlier this year Colonia reduced the nominal value of its shares from 50 marks each to five marks.
