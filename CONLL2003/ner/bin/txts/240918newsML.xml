<title>FRANCE: Investors to shun French shares in December - CSFB.</title>
<headline>Investors to shun French shares in December - CSFB.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>A stock market analyst at CSFB in London said international investors were likely to shun the Paris Bourse in December due to a number of uncertainties.</p>
<p>&quot;December is not going to be brilliant. The market is still expensive when compared with other markets and there at no signs of any recovery in economic fundamentals that would justify the profit expectations,&quot; said Jean-Luc de Lamaze, an analyst who follows the French market for CSFB in London.</p>
<p>He was speaking when Paris's CAC-40 blue chip index was down 91.5 points, or 3.9 percent on the day, at 2,200.99.</p>
<p>&quot;Recently there have been uncertainties on the monetary front and the Thomson decision has damaged the country's reputation in the eyes of investors,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a feeling that there is a social blockade and that does not entice investors; they will keep outside the market,&quot; De Lamaze said.</p>
<p>&quot;We had expected a correction, the market had risen too far and of late it had been inventing its own reasons to rise further based on merger speculation in the wake of UAP/AXA,&quot; he said, referring to the merger of insurers AXA and UAP .</p>
<p>CSFB is maintaining its year-end target of 2,200 for the CAC-40.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, we had that target. We are there now. We maintain the target,&quot; he said.</p>
