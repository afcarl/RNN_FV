Commission plans energy excise rates offensive.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

The European Commission is currently discussing plans to bring natural gas, coal and electricity under EU legislation which provides for minimum excise taxes on mineral oils and heating fuels.

The Commission is also to propose increasing the existing minimum taxes on such products as petrol, leaded petrol, diesel and heating fuel.

But a Commission official said this was unlikely to affect prices since the actual rates applied by national governments are well above the EU-wide minimums.

The proposal does not include Value Added Tax which is usually levied on top of excise taxes.

The move follows a long-standing failure to agree on a so-called CO2 tax to reduce carbon dioxide emissions levels in Europe. Instead, EU leaders agreed that the Commission should build on the current excise duty legislation by widening its scope to other energy products.

Taxation issues require a unanimous vote at ministerial level. The Commission is expected to forward its proposal to EU finance ministers in January.
