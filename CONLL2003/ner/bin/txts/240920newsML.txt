Munich Re - dividend rise still possible.

MUNICH 1996-12-06

Muenchener Rueckversicherungs AG, the world's largest reinsurer, said on Friday there was still upside potential on its dividend, which it raised to 16 marks per share in 1995/1996 from 13.50 marks.

Management board chairman Hans-Juergen Schinzler told shareholders that the abrupt hike in the dividend last year should not be interpreted as a "signal of an end."

Earlier, he had said that another 16 mark payout was secure for the business year ending June 30 1997.

Schinzler also said he saw no current need for a capital increase, and that the group could finance its planned takeover of American Re, at a cost of some five billion marks, out of its own resources.
