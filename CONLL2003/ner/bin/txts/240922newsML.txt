Greece's defiant farmers test PM's mettle.

Greece's socialist government and thousands of farmers crippling the nation's road network with blockades appear locked in a fight to the finish over economic policies.

The farmers' uprising, with 10,000 tractors blocking road and rail links for nine days, is the first real challenge to Prime Minister Costas Simitis's economic austerity programme.

After days of silence, Simitis weighed in to the battle and said the showdown was a pivotal moment defining the direction Greece will in convergence with the European Union.

"The Greek people decided two months ago who would rule the country," he said on television. "There are no margins for new hand-outs, new subsidies and new spending without restraint."

He delivered the blunt message to the group which has formed the backbone of his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) for years and always faired better than others.

But Simitis, lawyer and economist, is proving a different kind of socialist than late party founder Andreas Papandreou, who dished out state aid, especially in the countryside.

Simitis has used Greece's obligations to meet EU economic targets to justify a 1997 austerity budget, which stripped away many tax exemptions and subsidies.

He has argued that meeting economic targets, and entering the EU's economic and monetary union (EMU) as soon as possible after a 1999 target date will ensure Greece's future. All other considerations are secondary.

There has been widespread, but relatively tame, opposition to his programme. The streets of Athens reverberate daily to the chants of unhappy students, teachers, pensioners, tax and port officials and construction workers.

But the farmers, many fighting for economic survival, have been the first to challenge Simitis en masse and flatly reject his vision of the future.

"They tell us Greece will be destroyed if it misses the 'EU convergence train'. But this train concerns only the elite, the few rich ones," said farmers' representative Yannis Pattakis.

"The convergence train is not for the people. The farmers have no way of getting on it. They don't have money for the ticket," he added.

That is a message which Simitis would rather not spread to other sectors of the economy and he is clearly concerned that the farmers' revolt could inspire more widespread opposition.

He arranged hasty meetings with the leadership of the two largest labour confederations early this week but they said they would go ahead with one-day work stoppages on December 17.

Greece, the EU's poorest state, has until now accepted the Maastrict criteria and rarely debated EU economic convergence. There was no referendum on Maastrict and it cleared parliament easily.

But with time running out and Greece showing a new determination to push through the measures required to join EMU by 2001, a debate is emerging.

"We are asking for a change in economic policy. The farmers know that soon enough they will stop being farmers. That's why they won't be swayed," said Pattakis.

Keeping a lid on other groups may prove crucial if Simitis is going to have any chance of turning the public against the farmers action.

Officials have warned that meeting the farmers demands, for lower fuel costs, higher subsidies and rescheduling debts, would cost the government about $4 billion.

But the bill for the road blockage is also running up fast, with commerical lorries, trains, rural public buses and shops all saying that the effect is crippling.

Simitis, so low-key and media shy that he borders on being a recluse, has told the farmers to lift their blockade immediately but he has not said what he can do to make them.

"Simitis might have been able to find a way out early on but he took a tough line. If he caves in now it could open Pandora's box and incite other groups to protest," said one EU diplomat.
