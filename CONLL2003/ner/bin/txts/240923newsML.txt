Highlights of Friday's Commission briefing.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the European Commission on Friday:

Spokesman Peter Jorgensen briefed on Monday and Tuesday's Environment Council. He said discussions would focus on genetically modified micro-organisms, waste policy, leghold traps, quality of water, environment NGOs and sustainable development. He also said there would be a joint news conference by Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard, Council President Brendan Howlin and the World Wide Fund for Nature on the adoption of the EU CITES regulation on Monday, around 1300/1200 GMT.

Asked about U.S. genetically modified maize in the EU, Jorgensen said that it was not the Commission's responsibility but the Member States' to apply Community legislation and ensure the blocking of these products.

In answer to a question, spokesman Filippo di Robilant said the proposal for the 1997 fish quotas had been postponed to Monday.
