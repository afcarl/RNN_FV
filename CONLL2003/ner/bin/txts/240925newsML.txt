Nobel laureate Belo says peace will be his message.

ROME 1996-12-06

East Timorese Roman Catholic bishop Carlos Belo was quoted on Friday as saying that he would deliver a message of peace and reconciliation when he receives the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo next week.

"I will focus my words on the social teaching of the Church with regard to human dignity, to peace in the world, to reconciliation," Belo was quoted as saying by ANS, the Rome-based news service of his Salesian religious order.

Belo said he had received support from fellow bishops in Indonesia since learning he had won the Nobel Peace Prize.

"They told me: 'At least now we have a bishop who can talk. In Indonesia we cannot say anything. At least there in Timor we have someone who can speak out, can raise his voice'," the agency quoted him as saying.

Belo was jointly awarded the 1996 prize with self-exiled activist Jose Ramos Horta, who has led resistance in the territory to its annexation by Indonesia.

The Indonesian government has condemned the inclusion of Ramos Horta and has said it will not be represented officially at the award ceremony in the Norwegian capital.

ANS said the interview was conducted in Dili, where witnesses said Belo departed for Jakarta on Friday at the start of a trip that will take him to Oslo, Bonn and Rome, where he is due to meet Pope John Paul.

Belo and Ramos Horta won the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year. The United Nations has never recognised Jakarta's move.

Last month, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas warned Belo against meddling in politics after an interview in which the German magazine Der Spiegel quoted him as saying Indonesian troops treated East Timorese like "scabby dogs" and "slaves".

"I would say that the magazine used many foolish expressions, but they are Der Spiegel's," Belo said.

"The Indonesian government, especially the military, have felt wounded by those expressions but the fundamental problem is that here the people of Timor have been wounded and no one has ever apologised," ANS quoted Belo as saying.

The bishop is highly regarded by East Timorese, who gathered in their thousands to show their support when he returned to the territory after facing demonstrations against his comments in Der Spiegel while visiting Jakarta last month.
