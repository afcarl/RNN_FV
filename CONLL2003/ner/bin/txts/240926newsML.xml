<p>Swiss banks and the country's Jewish community voiced doubts on Friday about a governing party's plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward Holocaust victims.</p>
<p>The conservative Radical Democrats (FDP) have said they would ask parliament next week to order Swiss banks to put some 40 million Swiss francs ($31 million) in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for Jewish groups and charitable organisations.</p>
<p>It marks the first move at federal level to fix a collective payment to Jewish groups since Switzerland came under pressure last year over claims it profited cynically from the Holocaust.</p>
<p>The Swiss Bankers Association frowned on the idea, saying it was too early to hand out the money -- not all owned by Jews -- uncovered since last year in a search of old accounts run by the banks under pressure from the World Jewish Congress.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems too early to us for a special fund. We want as much of the money as possible to be matched with individual claims,&quot; said banking association spokeswoman Silvia Matile.</p>
<p>Matile said decisions on any left-over money should wait until two separate searches for owners were completed, probably some time in 1998.</p>
<p>Swiss banks are hunting for Holocaust accounts in two ways. A banking ombudsman is taking queries from individuals and a joint committee with Jewish groups run by former U.S. Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker is scouring bank records independently.</p>
<p>At the Swiss Jewish Federation (SIG), vice-president Thomas Lyssy agreed it was too early to lump all the ownerless accounts together before it was clear how much had belonged to Jews and whether legal heirs still existed.</p>
<p>&quot;We should wait for the results of the Volcker and ombudsman enquiries before dividing the money,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>FDP leaders defended the plan, but made clear the proposed fund should not be seen as the product of a guilty conscience.</p>
<p>&quot;The unclaimed assets that are known about do not belong to the banks and you have to ask whether this money shouldn't be dedicated to a good cause,&quot; FDP member Vreni Spoery, who first raised the idea in a parliament debate last week, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Spoerry, whose party is the biggest conservative bloc in the four-party centre-right government coalition, said the fund would not be an act of restitution but rather an effort to settle the difficult issue of unclaimed bank accounts.</p>
<p>&quot;The fund must not be seen as an admission of guilt,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The FDP's willingness to pay out the assets in question, money which has been unclaimed for at least ten years in accounts opened before 1945, is a marked change in the sparring between Jewish and Swiss leaders that started in 1995.</p>
<p>Some Jewish leaders, like British member of parliament Greville Janner, have demanded the Swiss pay a collective settlement to Holocaust survivors or their heirs for what critics say were Jewish accounts hidden by the banks.</p>
<p>Until now, Swiss banks and politicians have rejected those claims, arguing that any restitution must wait for proof of Swiss wrongdoing from three separate probes of the country's wartime role as a financial centre.</p>
