<title>PORTUGAL: Timor guerrilla offers Indonesia ceasefire.</title>

<p>East Timor guerrilla leader Konis Santana on Friday offered Indonesia a ceasefire in the disputed territory, providing Jakarta met conditions that included a halt to migration and a cut in its military presence.</p>
<p>&quot;If Indonesia agreed to freeze the ceaseless migration of its nationals to East Timor, and reduced its military personnel in East Timor, the guerrillas of Falantil would declare an indefinite ceasefire,&quot; he told Portugal's TSF radio.</p>
<p>The guerrillas, who clash periodically with Indonesian forces in the territory that Jakarta invaded 21 years ago, have made such offers in the past, but they have always been rejected.</p>
<p>Indonesia annexed East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in 1976 but its rule has never been recognised by the United Nations.</p>
<p>Opponents frequently accuse Indonesia, the world's largest Moslem state, of encouraging migration to the largely Roman Catholic East Timor to tighten its hold over the territory.</p>
<p>The offer of a ceasefire comes just four days before two East Timorese rights activists receive the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize at a ceremony in Oslo.</p>
<p>Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo and Jose Ramos-Horta, spokesman for jailed East Timor resistance leader Xanana Gusmao, were jointly awarded the $1.12 million prize for their efforts to find a peaceful solution to the East Timor problem.</p>
<p>Santana took over as head of the Falantil after Gusmao's capture by Indonesian forces in 1992.</p>
<p>Jakarta has spurned his past offers of a conditional peace saying that it will only accept a complete surrender.</p>
<p>The Indonesian army said recently that the number of guerrillas operating in the hills around the East Timor capital, Dili, had dwindled to less than 100, against some 200 earlier in the year.</p>
<p>But it calculates that the guerrillas can call on a 3,000-strong clandestine network of supporters around Indonesia.</p>
<p>Indonesia and Portugal have been holding periodic meetings under the auspices of the United Nations to seek a solution to the question of East Timor.</p>
<p>But there has been little progress, with Jakarta rejecting Portugal's call for the people of East Timor to be allowed to decide their future through some form of consultation.</p>
