Gene maize already in Portugal, Spain - EU diplomat.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

Shipments of U.S. gene-modified maize may already have arrived in Portugal and Spain in breach of EU rules, a European Union diplomat told reporters on Friday.

"According to our information from the European Commission, Spain and Portugal have already received shipments of maize," the diplomat said, referring to cargos containing corn from this year's U.S. harvest, the first to include a gene-modified strain made by Swiss chemicals company Ciba-Geigy AG.

The European Commission is due to decide on December 18 whether to allow imports of the modified maize, which Ciba Geigy has altered to make it resistant to the corn-borer pest and to increase its tolerance of certain weedkillers.

A Commission decision to clear the maize, which U.S. authorities have approved, will depend on advice from EU committees on food, animal feed and pesticides.

European Union environment ministers failed last June to agree on a French-backed proposal to approve the maize, with some citing fears related to the environmental effects of releasing the new strain and others saying that a "marker gene" used in the Ciba maize could undermine the effectiveness of an antibiotic used in animals and humans.

Commission environment spokesman Peter Jorgensen refused to say on Friday whether the EU executive had information indicating whether Portugal and Spain had received maize shipments containing the gene-modified strain.

He told a news conference that the EU's 15 member states were warned in writing on November 27 that it was their responsibility to stop such imports entering the bloc.
