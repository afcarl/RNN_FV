Commission postpones 1997 fish quota proposal.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

The European Commission has postponed until Monday the presentation of a proposal for total allowable catches (TACs) and national quotas, Commission fisheries spokesman Filippo di Robilant said.

"It was delayed for technical reasons...the tables were not yet ready," Di Robilant told a daily news briefing on Friday.

But he added that the Commission had completed the so-called written procedure for approving the proposal.

Commission sources have said that EU and international scientists have warned that major reductions will be needed in catches of mackerel and North Sea herring as well as plaice and sole in order to rebuild seriously depleted supplies.
