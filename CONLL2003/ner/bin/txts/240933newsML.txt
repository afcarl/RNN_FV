Portuguese govt, unions to hold wage talks.

LISBON 1996-12-06

The government and public sector unions will hold a further round of wage talks on Monday, a government spokeswoman said on Friday.

Unions have rejected the government's latest offer of a 2.6 percent wage rise for 1997, with union leaders pressing for increases of at least 3.5 percent.

The government says it cannot afford much more than its 2.5 percent inflation target for next year without jeopardising Portugal's hopes of qualifying for the European Union's planned monetary union.
