<p>North Korea's food shortages will worsen next year and the country will be unable to feed its people without substantial foreign help, two United Nations agencies reported on Friday.</p>
<p>The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) issued their report after a joint mission from October 19 to November 2 to the communist country, where floods have devastated crops for two years in succession.</p>
<p>&quot;The mission's assessment shows that (North) Korea will enter 1997 with a substantially larger food deficit than in 1996 which could further aggravate the already weak nutritional status of the population,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the forecast level, domestic food supplies from this year's harvest will be sufficient to cover need for about seven months...</p>
<p>&quot;The country therefore approaches 1997 in a far worse position than 1996 and will again depend heavily on large scale international assistance to help it meet minimum food requirements,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>South Korea said on Thursday that 17 North Koreans -- 16 members of one family and a security guard -- had fled through China to Hong Kong where they were awaiting asylum in South Korea.</p>
<p>It was the biggest single flight from North Korea and set off alarm bells in Seoul that the North's deteriorating food and economic situation might soon become so dire that there would be a mass exodus.</p>
<p>About 600 North Korean defectors are now living in the South. In recent months, arrivals have been seen to rise as chronic food shortages bite into the lives of the population.</p>
<p>International relief agencies have reported that peasants in the North are scrounging for tree bark, grass and edible roots in their search for food because of the failure of two successive annual food crops due to floods.</p>
<p>The FAO/WFP report said falling food output because of the floods had been accompanied by the impact of economic problems which had reduced domestic production of fertilisers and imports of essential items to agriculture such as fuel and spare parts.</p>
<p>It said up to half the country's 1996 maize harvest and almost all of the potato crop had been consumed in August and September because of the severe food shortages.</p>
<p>&quot;In doing so...the country has in effect merely deferred part of the food problem from this year to next,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The agencies estimated overall domestic production of milled rice and maize available for use in the current marketing year at 2.8 million tonnes, 2.3 million tonnes short of minimum needs.</p>
