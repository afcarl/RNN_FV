EU draft treaty "a fair document" - UK official.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

The British government believes the draft for a new European Union treaty to be discussed by EU leaders at a summit in Dublin next week is a fair document that lays out all the issues facing the bloc, British officials said on Friday.

"The British view is that it is a well-judged and competent piece of work. It is good that all member states' positions are in it," one official said.

"There are things we don't like...(but) overall we think this...is a reasonable basis for covering the negotiations over the next six months. We think it is a fair document," the official said.

The draft unveiled by Ireland on Thursday outlines many areas of difference between Britain and its continental partners. But Ireland chose to write the draft in such a way that it does not commit any country to any particular position.

Although British officials played down the controversy over the document, it comes at a time of intense turmoil in the ruling Conservative Party's ranks over Europe.

Britain's Malcolm Rifkind was discussing the draft with other EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Friday and was due to brief reporters later in the day.

Seen from continental Europe, the draft is no more than a report on the state of negotiations for a treaty to be agreed next June.

Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said when arriving at the meeting that he was pleased with initial reaction from most member states to the draft.

Asked whether it would be possible to reach a compromise, especially in view of British scepticism about further EU integration and the fact that elections in Britain must be held before May, he told reporters:

"I think in terms of the interests of the citizens of Europe that we should work very hard to ensure we have the necessary compromise in Amsterdam."

The paper puts forward draft treaty texts on most issues apart from some of the most contentious items, such as more majority voting in EU decision-making and a "flexibility clause" that would allow some member states to move ahead faster than others.
