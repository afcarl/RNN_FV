<p>The British government believes the draft for a new European Union treaty to be discussed by EU leaders at a summit in Dublin next week is a fair document that lays out all the issues facing the bloc, British officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The British view is that it is a well-judged and competent piece of work. It is good that all member states' positions are in it,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are things we don't like...(but) overall we think this...is a reasonable basis for covering the negotiations over the next six months. We think it is a fair document,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>The draft unveiled by Ireland on Thursday outlines many areas of difference between Britain and its continental partners. But Ireland chose to write the draft in such a way that it does not commit any country to any particular position.</p>
<p>Although British officials played down the controversy over the document, it comes at a time of intense turmoil in the ruling Conservative Party's ranks over Europe.</p>
<p>Britain's Malcolm Rifkind was discussing the draft with other EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Friday and was due to brief reporters later in the day.</p>
<p>Seen from continental Europe, the draft is no more than a report on the state of negotiations for a treaty to be agreed next June.</p>
<p>Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said when arriving at the meeting that he was pleased with initial reaction from most member states to the draft.</p>
<p>Asked whether it would be possible to reach a compromise, especially in view of British scepticism about further EU integration and the fact that elections in Britain must be held before May, he told reporters:</p>
<p>&quot;I think in terms of the interests of the citizens of Europe that we should work very hard to ensure we have the necessary compromise in Amsterdam.&quot;</p>
<p>The paper puts forward draft treaty texts on most issues apart from some of the most contentious items, such as more majority voting in EU decision-making and a &quot;flexibility clause&quot; that would allow some member states to move ahead faster than others.</p>
