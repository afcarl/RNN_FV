<p>Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said in an interview on Friday the criteria for entry into Europe's planned single currency should be expanded to include national savings rates and current account data.</p>
<p>&quot;The criteria are presented like they are the 10 commandments, that's why I would raise their number,&quot; Ciampi told Austrian daily Die Presse. &quot;There are aspects of economic reality that are not reflected in any of the criteria. For example the savings rate of a country.&quot;</p>
<p>The so-called Maastricht criteria for Europe's planned economic and monetary union (EMU) target entry levels in terms of public debt, deficits, inflation, exchange rates and interest rate levels.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't pass judgement on the indebtedness of a country if you don't take into account the private savings rate,&quot; Ciampi said. &quot;A country like Italy with a savings rate that makes it possible to cover all financial requirements does not have an imbalance.&quot;</p>
<p>He said a country's current account should also be added to the list of criteria for entry into EMU to paint a more representative picture of the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;But since that is not possible, we should at least try to respect not just the protocol to the Maastricht Treaty, but also the (accompanying) articles,&quot; Ciampi said.  </p>
<p>The minister reiterated Italy's firm intention to be among the first wave of countries to join EMU in 1999. &quot;We are prepared to do whatever is needed for that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ciampi admitted that Italy was far from meeting the Maastricht treaty's debt criterion, where the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product (GDP) should not exceed 60 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Please keep in mind that according to the treaty not only the figure, but also the tendency will be taken into account. If that criterion would be applied strictly, only very few countries could make it before (the year) 2000,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ciampi said a strong and stable euro was in Italy's own interest. &quot;After all, we don't want to participate in order to weaken the euro,&quot; he added. -- Vienna newsroom +431 53112 274</p>
