Italian cabinet approves draft law to boost jobs.

ROME 1996-12-06

The Italian cabinet approved a draft law on Friday aimed at promoting employment which is linked to an accord reached earlier this year between the government, unions and employers on reducing joblessness.

The bill sets out guidelines on temporary employment, regulations on fixed contracts, rights on job training, incentives for part-time working schemes, apprenticeships and other issues regarding the workplace.

The draft legislation is a follow-up to the accord reached between industry, workers and the centre-left government in late September which included a reduction in the working week, incentives to start businesses, tax breaks on research and encouragement for training schemes.
