EU seen facing tough wheat export competition - ZMP.

BONN 1996-12-06

European Union wheat exporters needed to search hard for marketing chances in a season characterised by fewer buyers and higher supplies, German farm price office ZMP wrote in a weekly circular.

"Global crops have risen but major importers need less supplementary supply," it said.

Chances of higher wheat purchases were seen in Central and South America, where 1996/97 imports were pegged at 17.5 million tonnes versus 16.5 milliion in 95/96.

Forecasts of 10 million tonnes of wheat imports by the Middle East in 1996/97 after 9.8 million in 95/96, should only materialise if Iran and Iraq covered import needs according to expectations.

But Chinese import demand was seen falling sharply, which would help cut total Asian demand to 32 million tonnes from 35.4 million the previous season.

Africa should also import 1.5 million tonnes less at 18.0 million tonnes in the 1996/97 season, when EU exporters would be especially hard hit by lower Algerian and Moroccon buying.

Argentina, Australia and Canada on the other hand had ample wheat export potential and the U.S. was unlikely to stay out of global markets as domestic use would not absorb surpluses.

ZMP said the EU was unlikely to reach a theoretical export target of 20 million tonnes of wheat and wheat flour in 96/97, compared with 12.1 million last season.

Export commitments since July totalled 3.75 million in soft wheat -- not counting Thursday's 429,400 tonnes -- compared with 4.67 million last year, while wheat flour exports were steady at 2.1 million tonnes.

ZMP's export target was based on the assumption that 96/97 carry-in stocks of nine million tonnes would be maintained by end-season and EU domestic wheat use would be 72 million tonnes, up 2.8 million.

This created a 96/97 wheat surplus for exports and stocks of 29 million (22 million 95/96). --Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275
