Dasa sees Alenia's Airbus role growing.

BONN 1996-12-06

Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (Dasa) said on Friday the new involvement of Italy's Alenia in Airbus would fall short of a full partnership with the aircraft consortium's four members, but would deepen over time.

"What we and our Italian friends wanted to achieve was their step-by-step involvement as aeroplane makers in the Airbus system," Dasa chairman Manfred Bischoff told Reuters.

"But that does not mean that Alenia will have the same status as other Airbus partners," he said after a news conference.

Earlier, members of the Airbus consortium -- Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Dasa and CASA of Spain -- announced a deal increasing Alenia's involvement in production operations to help rationalise the industry.

Alenia, which is already a subcontractor to Airbus and involved in the Airbus military transport programme for the Future Large Aircraft (FLA) would now also become involved in the AXX, the high capacity four-engined aircraft project.

Sweden's Saab has also expressed an interest in joining the AXX project as have Dutch politicians in order to salvage jobs and knowledge at bankrupt Fokker.

The statement said that Alenia will also be requested to participate in programmes of new derivatives from existing Airbus products, such as the A340-600.

A specific agreement has been reached on the new 100-seat jet family in which all the European partners involved have agreed will be part of the Airbus product range.

Airbus Industrie, together with Alenia/Finmeccanica, will establish a new company to lead the European participation in the joint venture with China and Singapore.

Bischoff said that members of the Airbus consortium were "working very hard" on restructuring the alliance into a single operating company, but talks are making slow progress on how stakes will be determined.

"We are making progress, but it is rather hard work, because interests are different in each of the countries," he said.
