<p>The French military, faced by an end to conscription in 2002, have drafted an Oscar-winning film-maker to help recruit soldiers for an all-professional army of the future.</p>
<p>France's Pierre Schoendoerffer, who won a Hollywood Oscar for his 1966 documentary &quot;The Anderson Platoon&quot; about the U.S. Army in Vietnam, directed the first television advertisement of the new campaign which was shown to the press on Friday.</p>
<p>The clip was made for the ground forces which will shrink from 270,000 to 170,000 with the disappearance of conscription which has existed in France for more than 200 years.</p>
<p>But the army will simultaneously need to double the number of enlisted personnel from 32,000 to 65,000 to replace conscripts who made up the brunt of its forces in Europe.</p>
<p>The commercial, which lasts 30 seconds and cost six million francs ($1.2 million) including air-time rights, starts running on French television stations at the weekend.</p>
<p>Amateurs of war films who had expected a follow-up of Schoendoerffer's tough, prize-winning fiction films, &quot;The 317th Section&quot; (1965) and &quot;Dienbienphu&quot; (1992), both about France's Indochina War of 1946-54 in which the director fought, will be disappointed.</p>
<p>The ad openly pitches at offering French youth secure jobs in a society where there are more than three million unemployed rather -- than alluring them with promises of tropical adventure and combat.</p>
<p>It shows half a dozen typical youths, including a young woman and two members of minority groups, being separately asked questions such as &quot;Why do you want this job?&quot; and &quot;Would you mind learning about communications?&quot; Only one question alludes to possible risks.</p>
<p>The ad ends with the camera turning to the questioner, a fatherly-looking colonel explaining that &quot;Each year, the army offers 10,000 jobs in 400 professions.&quot;</p>
<p>Army chief General Philippe Mercier told reporters he expected little difficulties in filling new posts, especially since starting pay had been boosted more than three-fold to 5,600 francs ($1,100) a month.</p>
<p>Some specialists question the army optimism, saying motivated recruits traditionally flock to units like the paratroops and marines who are already made up only of professionals and who take part in France's frequent military forays in Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is going to be tempted with being an infantryman in a suicidally-dreary garrison in rainy eastern France?&quot; a sceptical officer said. &quot;And how do we know that those youths who join to learn a trade are going to be sufficiently motivated if they have to go into combat ?&quot;</p>
