<p>Western nations, including the United States, on Friday expressed deep concern over lingering questions about illicit biological weapons activity in Iraq.</p>
<p>But the group of 23 Western countries said that, for the sake of consensus, they would drop any mention of Iraq from a final statement being issued later in the day by a conference reviewing compliance with the 1972 Biological Weapons Treaty.</p>
<p>In a statement read out by Australia, the Western nations said they closely followed the work of UNSCOM, the United Nations Special Commission. Set up after the 1991 Gulf War, UNSCOM is charged with overseeing the scrapping of Iraq's chemical, biological and ballistic weapons programmes.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to be very concerned about the information uncovered by UNSCOM. We remain very concerned by the revelations of illicit biological weapons activity, including questions that remain unanswered about dismantlement and destruction of that programme,&quot; the group said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission (UNSCOM) noted in its last report that this biological disarmament process was not yet completed,&quot; added the statement, read out by Australia's ambassador John Campbell.</p>
<p>The Western statement referred to comments by Iraq's delegation which had made clear that retaining any reference to UNSCOM activity would mean no consensus on a final declaration.</p>
<p>It said that, in the interests of reaching consensus, &quot;while reiterating that all members of the conference condemn any non-compliance with the convention's prohibitions and the obligations therein undertaken, we are prepared to agree to the deletion of the language in the report referring to UNSCOM activities.&quot;</p>
<p>Iraq's envoy to the Geneva conference took the floor to defend his country, according to Western diplomats.</p>
<p>Experts from many of the 138 states which have ratified the global pact banning biological weapons have taken part in the two-week review conference, held every four years.</p>
<p>During the talks, the United States said it suspected 12 countries -- including Russia, China and Iraq -- of having active biological weapons systems in various stages.</p>
<p>Delegates were arguing over what to say in the declaration about two major infractions committed since the last talks in 1991 -- discovery of Iraq's programme that year and President Boris Yeltsin's admission in 1992 that Russia had inherited an offensive biological weapons programme from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>It was not clear whether the final declaration would refer to lingering concern over Russia. On Thursday, diplomats said it would be difficult to refer to Baghdad and not to Moscow.</p>
<p>The final declaration will urge acceleration of negotiations to set up a verification regime aimed at strengthening the treaty, which was negotiated during the Cold War era.</p>
<p>But it will not stipulate a time frame for wrapping up the negotiations, Western diplomats said.</p>
<p>The United States wants agreement to be reached by 1998 for international experts to conduct on-site inspections of suspected programmes.</p>
<p>Non-aligned states dislike the intrusion of on-site inspections and also fought against current export controls during the meeting. But Western countries succeeded in leaving the controls in place, according to diplomats.</p>
<p>Britain's ambassador Sir Michael Weston, chairman of the session, was due to give a final news conference at 1330GMT.</p>
