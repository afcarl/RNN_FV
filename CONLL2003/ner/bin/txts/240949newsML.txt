Britain unfazed by EU draft treaty-UK official.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

The British government believes that a new draft European Union treaty to be discussed by EU leaders at a summit in Dublin next week is a fair document that lays out all the issues facing the bloc, British officials said on Friday.

"The British view is that it is a well-judged and competent piece of work. It is good that all member states' positions are in it," one official said.  

"There are things we don't like...(but) overall we think this...is a reasonable basis for covering the negotiations over the next six months. We think it is a fair document," the official said.

Ireland on Thursday unveiled a draft EU treaty that outlines many areas of difference between Britain and its continental partners. But it chose to write the draft in such a way that it does not commit any country to any particular position.

Although British officials played down the controversy over the draft document, it comes at a time of intense turmoil in the ruling Conservative Party's ranks over Europe.
