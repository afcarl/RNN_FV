<p>November inflation was expected to fall to 7.9 percent year-on-year while the key 12-month T-bill rate was cut 50 basis points to 11.50 percent in late November.</p>
<p>Farmers, defying a plea by Prime Minister Costas Simitis, continued a nine-day blockade of major highways protesting against Greece's austere 1997 budget and vowing to spend the Christmas holidays by the roadblocks.</p>
<p>They are demanding lower diesel fuel prices, cuts in the VAT tax on farm equipment, rescheduling of 1.3 billion drachmas of debt by farm cooperatives to state banks and higher price supports especially for cotton.</p>
<p>Talks between the socialist government and representatives of the farmers broke down on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Costas Simitis appealed to farmers on Thursday to end their crippling eight-day blockade of national road and rail links, saying it was posing a serious threat to the economy.</p>
