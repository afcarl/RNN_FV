French stocks fall by more than 100 points.

PARIS 1996-12-06

French shares fell below the 2,200 level with a decline of over 100 points as remarks by Bundesbank member Jochimsen exacerbated a plunge, initially sparked by comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 110.80 points or 4.83 percent at 2,181.66 at 1157 GMT while the CAC-40 futures contract was down at 2,185 from 2,294 on Thursday's close.  

Jochimsen said that there was no need for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth and also said that the German economy was not yet strong enough for self-sustained growth.

The comments came when Paris was already down by over three percent due to the Greenspan remark warning markets about "irrational exuberance" which was taken as a big selling sign.

A stocks analyst at Paribas said the U.S. payroll data due at 1330 GMT data would be decisive for the rest of the day and next week. "If the figures are just bad (job creation of 200/220,000 ex-farm) the market will be flat to weaker and remain on its toes due to Greenspan," the analyst said.  

"If they are good (about 170,000 jobs created) the market could flatten out. But if they are very bad the correction can continue," he added.

Paribas keeps its end of year target at 2,200.

Brokers said they expected Wall Street could fall by as much as 100 points. Analysts said that the Paris market, which had been trading near its life high recently, could fall another two to three percent over the coming days.

"The Greenspan comments were an excuse to take profits," said Gary Dugan, French equity analyst at JP Morgan in London.  

"In Paris we had been trading some seven to eight percent above the 90-day moving average and we were expecting a correction. I think we can still go down another two to three percent," he said.

"I maintain my year end target of 2,200," he added.

At the start of December, 17 French analysts polled by newspaper L'Agefi had increased their three-month forecast for the CAC-40 to 2,317.69 from 2,183.70.

During a dinner at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington on Thursday, Greenspan said that there was a risk that the financial bubble would burst.  

"Greenspan sent a clear message to the markets -- 'Gentlemen, you are overdoing it, restrain yourselves.' He is puncturing the speculative bubble that fuelled New York and other markets," a dealer said

"The correction will be quite volatile for a few days but then there will be a stabilisation on a healthy level and we can be serene at the start of 1997," another broker said.
