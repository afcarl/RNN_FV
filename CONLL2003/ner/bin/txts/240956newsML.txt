DUESSELDORF, Germany 1996-12-06

Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen said on Friday that the recent rise in the dollar was based on the relative weakness of European currencies.

"The dollar appreciation was not real dollar strength but European weakness," Jochimsen said.

He said there had been speculation in foreign exchange markets about how stable the future European single currency would be.
