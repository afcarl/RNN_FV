<p>Iran is interested in buying troubled east German heavy machinery maker Sket Magdeburg GmbH, the government privatisation authority said on Friday.</p>
<p>An Iranian delegation led by minister for mines and metals Mohammad Hossein Mahlouji discussed the purchase of the machinery group as a whole with state authorities in the state of Saxony Anhalt on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The Iranian delegation's interest in the privatisation of Sket Magdeburg, which became clear yesterday, will be reviewed when concrete proposals are presented,&quot; the Bundesanstalt fuer Vereinigungsbedingte Sonderaugfaben (BvS), successor to the Treuhand agency, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Germany, Iran's largest European trading partner, has come under fire from other leading nations for its close relations with Iran, which owes it $13 billion.</p>
<p>But Bonn's policy of dialogue has recently been strained by the Berlin trial of five men for the 1992 killing of three Kurdish dissidents and their translator in Berlin. Prosecutors allege Teheran ordered the killings.</p>
<p>Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt was due to meet Mahlouji on Friday in Bonn. The Sket purchase was likely to be on the agenda, a ministry spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Sket, which once employed 18,000 workers and was a main supplier to communist eastern Europe, has absorbed billions in state aid after posting heavy losses since German unification. Officials say it continues to lose half a million marks a day.</p>
<p>BvS approved earlier this week a restructuring plan that would split Sket into five companies and shrink the workforce to 425 workers from 1,850.</p>
<p>The Iranian group is familiar with the BvS plan, but is interested in buying Sket in its entirety. In the talks on Thursday, however, it made no specific proposals on jobs or investments, BvS said.</p>
<p>BvS said it would only release restructuring funds after the European Commission approves the restructuring plan. Earlier, the restructuring funds were said to total 200 million to 300 million marks.</p>
<p>The five companies set to continue Sket's work have already been founded and are due to start up on January 2, leaving only a narrow window of opportunity.</p>
<p>In mid-October Sket filed for liquidation proceedings after its workforce refused to support a drastic cost-cutting programme that would have cut the workforce by two-thirds.</p>
