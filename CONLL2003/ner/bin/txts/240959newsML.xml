<p>Irish bonds slipped in nervous early trade on Friday in line with most European markets following a sharp overnight drop in U.S. Treasuries on words of caution from Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, dealers said.</p>
<p>Greenspan said the Fed must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stock and other asset markets because that could end up damaging the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;All European markets are down after Greenspan's comments. We have fallen about the same amount as the UK but more than Germany has,&quot; one dealers said. &quot;The pressure will remain on ahead of the release of the non-farm payrolls data in the U.S. later today.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;The comments represent something of a change of tack for Greenspan, he is normally restrained in what he says. That has made the market nervous ahead of this afternoon's data,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>By 1145 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 had slipped 95 pence from Thursday's close at 100.75 to yield 6.22 percent while the eight percent bond due 2006 had fallen 120 pence from the close at 107.75 to yield 6.76 percent.</p>
<p>A Reuter survey of economists forecasts 179,000 new non-farm payrolls in November versus a 210,000-rise previously. The unemployment rate was expected to remain steady at 5.2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;If the non-farm payrolls number is higher than expected then we can expect Ireland to exaggerate any further easing in international markets,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
