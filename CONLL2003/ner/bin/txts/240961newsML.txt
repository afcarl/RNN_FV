GENEVA 1996-12-06

Reports of a massacre of 28 Iraqi Kurds near the Turkish and Iranian borders in October emerged on Friday, and the United Nations UNHCR refugee agency said it had asked Turkey for explanation.

UNHCR spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume told a briefing the Kurds were killed by an unidentified paramilitary group between Iran's and Turkey's borders on northern Iraq on October 14.

The victims were from a group of 30 fleeing violence in northern Iraq and trying to enter Turkey. Only two survived the attack, Berthiaume said.

"UNHCR has demanded explanation from the government of Turkey, which promised an investigation. We're waiting for the outcome," she said.

The border area is the scene of a guerrilla war between Turkish troops and Turkish Kurd rebels fighting for independence and operating from bases in northern Iraq. More than 21,000 people have been killed in the 12-year-old conflict.
