Buba's Jochimsen 90 pct sure EMU to start on time.

DUESSELDORF 1996-12-06

Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen said on Friday that he was 90 percent sure that European Monetary and Economic Union (EMU) would start on schedule in 1999.

But he told reporters he was disappointed that Bonn had been unable to win support from other European nations for its version of a stability pact designed to ensure fiscal discipline.

"It is all the more regrettable that the version of the stability pact with real automatic sanctions as demanded by Germany has not to date established itself among EU members," he said.

He said that the EU stability pact draft proposed by the European Union gives big scope for a softening of budget monitoring.

"The draft of the EU commission on which current talks are based still offers far-reaching scope to water down the budget monitoring procedure."

Jochimsen added that a deal on an effective stability pact and a EMS II would boost credability of the future Europeann currency, the Euro.

"An agreement on a really tangible, confidence-creating stability pact and on a solid construction for a not overdemanding European Monetary System could not only improve planning certainty for companies but could also confront uncertainty on the financial markets and strengthen the credibility of the entire currency project," Jochimsen said.

He added that it was "extremely unfortunate" that European government leaders planned to refrain from the end-1996 review of nations' convergence which was stipulated in the Maastricht Treaty as a binding requirement.

"This would have led to greater clarity about the interpretation of the convergence criteria laid down in the Treaty and would have given the companies affected a sounder basis for decision-making," Jochimsen said.

It would have also boosted financial market confidence in European monetary union.

He added that it would be a mistake to decide now on whether to postpone monetary union.

"The question about whether to postpone is not off the agenda but will be addressed in early 1998, and with all urgency," Jochimsen said.
