Cr Foncier unions tell Arthuis to resign.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Trade unions at French property lender Credit Foncier called for the immediate resignation of Finance Minister Jean Arthuis on Friday.

The six unions, fighting to halt Arthuis' plans to wind down Credit Foncier, said in a statement that there was a conflict of interest in his job as minister and head of an accounting firm which approved the accounts of a Credit Foncier subsidiary in the past.
