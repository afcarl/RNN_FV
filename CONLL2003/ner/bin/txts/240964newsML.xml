<p>The Belgian government, fighting to restore shattered public confidence in police and judicial authorities, started a day-long special cabinet meeting on Friday to review the legal system.</p>
<p>Options being studied for tightening the justice system and winning back public confidence in the wake of a horrific child sex and murder scandal range from ending political appointment of magistrates and integrating the often rival police services.</p>
<p>The scandal, which erupted in mid-August, revealed a catalogue of mistakes in investigation of a paedophile ring. At least four young girls died at the hands of paedophiles.</p>
<p>&quot;Confronted with the problems of the past few months, the government made promises. Reforms had been planned, (but) this policy is being accelerated,&quot; Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's spokeswoman Monique Delvou told Reuters.</p>
<p>Dehaene's centre-left cabinet will wade through a mass of proposals, including stricter parole procedures, better help for crime victims, an end to political appointments of magistrates, and integration of the different, and often competing, police services.</p>
<p>&quot;They will look at some new things...and some that have already been under discussion. The public is waiting for decisions from the government,&quot; Delvou said.</p>
<p>Cabinet members would explore the idea of a victims' charter, and capacity in Belgium's crowded prisons was also an issue. Last week prison officers staged a 24-hour strike in protest at low staffing levels.</p>
<p>Belgian magistrates are wary of reform and on Thursday the Cour de Cassation, Belgium's highest court, sent a sharp letter to the government, complaining that the courts themselves were not involved in the government's review of the system.</p>
<p>That same court was the focus of a wave of public outrage after it decided to remove a popular magistrate, Jean-Marc Connerotte, from the paedophile murder investigation for accepting a plate of spaghetti at a solidarity evening for families of the victims.</p>
<p>Connerotte's removal was followed by a &quot;White March&quot; when a quarter of a million people filed through Brussels in support of the child victims' families and to show their concern over the law and order system.</p>
<p>After the paedophile scandal blew up Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck moved swiftly to publicise new proposals.</p>
<p>Just two weeks after Marc Dutroux -- the main suspect in the paedophile ring -- was arrested the cabinet approved tougher rules on the early release from jail of child sex offenders.</p>
<p>These included setting up a special tribunal of magistrates to vet requests for early release, which would work on the basis of unanimity for paedophile crimes and in other serious cases.</p>
<p>A convicted child rapist, Dutroux had been released on parole in 1992, 10 years early from a 13-year sentence.</p>
<p>In August this year he led police to the bodies of two young girls who had been abducted 14 months earlier and buried in his garden. Two others were found on another property.</p>
<p>Questions were raised over whether Dutroux had enjoyed high level protection to remain undetected so long, and why police and judiciary had apparently not exchanged vital information.</p>
<p>De Clerck promised child abusers would be treated in more special centres and be better monitored on their release.</p>
<p>There would be an independent examination of all the 8,000 examples of prisoners currently on conditional release to see how well they were being observed.</p>
<p>He has also pledged to improve links between the police, the magistrature and state prosecution, and to make sure slow-moving cases are chased up.</p>
