UN says cholera hit 1,220 Zaire refugees, 30 dead.

GENEVA 1996-12-06

The U.N. health agency said on Friday 30 people died from an outbreak of cholera in east Zaire and in a Rwanda transit camp since November among 1,220 confirmed cases, but reported the epidemic had hit its peak.

World Health Organisation (WHO) spokesman Philippe Stroot told a Geneva briefing that the situation was under control.

Since November 16, cholera claimed 23 lives in east Zaire's Goma region where 1,123 cases had been confirmed, he said.

In Runda transit centre near Rwanda's capital Kigali, WHO reported seven dead among 97 confirmed cases of cholera.

"The situation is under control. WHO specialists think that the epidemic has already reached its peak," Stroot said.

More than half a million Rwandan Hutus poured out of Goma last month after Tutsi rebels shelled a camp and forced Hutu militiamen to flee. The U.N. refugee agency says 700,000 more refugees are still scattered in east Zaire.

A cholera outbreak claimed 30,000 lives in Goma in 1994 when Rwandan Hutu refugees fled after a Hutu-led genocide of minority Tutsis. At the peak of the epidemic, more than 5,000 people died in a single day.

Primary sources of cholera infection are contaminated drinking water and food prepared by infected persons. Preventive actions include cholorination of wells, boiling water for cooking and building pit latrines.

Treatment involves rehydration to replace water and salts lost through severe diarrhoea and vomiting. Severe cases require intravenous rehydration and treatment with antibiotics.
