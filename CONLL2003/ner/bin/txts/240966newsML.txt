Swedish shares plunge on Greenspan comments.

STOCKHOLM 1996-12-06

In line with international trends, Swedish shares plummeted on Friday morning after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned of "irrational exuberance" infecting financial markets.

"Shares traded in New York are particularly hit ahead of the U.S. opening," said a trader with a Stockholm bank, giving drugs company Astra and telecoms group Ericsson as examples.

At 1130 GMT, the general index was down 3.13 percent at 2251.33 in 2.44 billion crowns of turnover.

Players said the drop was only natural as the index had risen about 35 percent this year to a record high on Thursday.  

Brokers said general indices could fall around five percent, or possibly up to 10 percent, in the next few days before stabilising. Dealers and analysts did not see a risk of the Stockholm bourse collapsing as inflation and interest rates are low in Sweden.

Astra was down 13 crowns at 324 crowns after leaping nine crowns on Thursday while fellow bluechip Ericsson was eight crowns lower at 195.5 crowns.

Forestry group Stora dropped 4.50 crowns to 90 crowns. Earlier on Friday, its chief executive officer dismissed a newspaper article about plans to build a mega mill in Brazil.  

Greenspan's remarks and the following U.S. market reaction set Swedish bond yields surging with the ten-year bond up 15 basis points at 7.07 percent.

The crown also took a beating and softened against the mark, trading at 4.3995 crowns to a mark compared with 4.3800 late Thursday.
