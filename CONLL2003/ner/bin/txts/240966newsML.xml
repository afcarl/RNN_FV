<title>SWEDEN: Swedish shares plunge on Greenspan comments.</title>
<headline>Swedish shares plunge on Greenspan comments.</headline>
<dateline>STOCKHOLM 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>In line with international trends, Swedish shares plummeted on Friday morning after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infecting financial markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Shares traded in New York are particularly hit ahead of the U.S. opening,&quot; said a trader with a Stockholm bank, giving drugs company Astra and telecoms group Ericsson as examples.</p>
<p>At 1130 GMT, the general index was down 3.13 percent at 2251.33 in 2.44 billion crowns of turnover.</p>
<p>Players said the drop was only natural as the index had risen about 35 percent this year to a record high on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Brokers said general indices could fall around five percent, or possibly up to 10 percent, in the next few days before stabilising. Dealers and analysts did not see a risk of the Stockholm bourse collapsing as inflation and interest rates are low in Sweden.</p>
<p>Astra was down 13 crowns at 324 crowns after leaping nine crowns on Thursday while fellow bluechip Ericsson was eight crowns lower at 195.5 crowns.</p>
<p>Forestry group Stora dropped 4.50 crowns to 90 crowns. Earlier on Friday, its chief executive officer dismissed a newspaper article about plans to build a mega mill in Brazil.  </p>
<p>Greenspan's remarks and the following U.S. market reaction set Swedish bond yields surging with the ten-year bond up 15 basis points at 7.07 percent.</p>
<p>The crown also took a beating and softened against the mark, trading at 4.3995 crowns to a mark compared with 4.3800 late Thursday.</p>
