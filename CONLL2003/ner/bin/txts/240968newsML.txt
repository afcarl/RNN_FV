VW rebuffs GM call for more action on Lopez.

WOLFSBURG, Germany 1996-12-06

Volkswagen AG on Friday rejected a demand by General Motors to take immediate action to distance itself further from former purchasing manager Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.

Volkswagen spoksman Klaus Kocks told Reuters that VW was still waiting for clarification on whether charges will be filed against Lopez on allegations he stole secret documents from GM in 1993 when he left the company to join VW.

The comment came after GM and its German unit Adam Opel AG earlier said VW needed to take "fundamental steps" if any out of court settlement is to be reached in a civil action that GM has brought.

GM said that such steps included acknowledgment by VW that Lopez had acted wrongly while working for VW and that the car maker should sever business relations with him and other executives who left GM to join VW.

"These steps do not threaten, and are not meant to cause any threat to, the jobs of innocent Volkswagen employees, but do begin to address the negative effects the wrongful conduct has had on the employees of Opel," GM said in a statement.

VW said it is still waiting for a decision on whether charges will be filed from the public prosecutor's office in Darmstadt, near Frankfurt.

GM also criticised the request of an attorney representing Lopez in the U.S. for a stay in GM's civil suit.

"GM and Opel continue to seek a judicial determination of the truth as expeditiously as possible in the VW/Lopez case, and believe that the appropriate forum to argue the facts and evidence is in courts of law," GM said in a statement.

But Kocks also said that VW officials named as defendants in a U.S. civil court law suit filed by GM against VW would agree to testify in any future court hearings.

"There have been reports in Detroit newspapers that all Volkswagen officials would plead the Fifth Amendment and agree to take their right not to incriminate themselves," Kocks said.

He added: "I cannot speak for Mr. Lopez but as far as Volkswagen is concerned all top executives will go to court, including in Detroit." Kocks said.

The anticipated criminal charges against Lopez stem from allegations that he stole confidential documents when he left GM and joined VW in 1993.

Lopez resigned from the German car maker, Europe's largest, last week, saying he wanted to concentrate on his criminal defence and set up a consulting company. But he may remain in contact with the company as a consultant.
