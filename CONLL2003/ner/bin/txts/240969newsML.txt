Greek consumer price inflation dropped to 7.7 percent year-on-year in November from 8.3 percent in October, the National Statistics Service (NSS) said.

"Last year, we had a drop of 15.75 percent in motor oil prices and its impact was 0.32 percent," said Fani Zervou, NSS general secretary. "This year, we had a reduction of 25.20 percent and its impact on CPI was a negative 0.59 percent."

She declined to make a forecast about December but said that December CPI inflation rose 1.0 percent month-on-month in the last three years.

"No price increases were detected in the Athens-Pireaus area in early December sampling," she added.

Greek bankers and economists polled by Reuters had predicted inflation would fall to 7.9 percent in November. The range of forecasts was 7.8 percent to 8.0 percent.
