Soymeal prices seen holding firm in north Europe.

BONN 1996-12-06

Northern European soymeal prices are likely to stay firm for the next few months, German farm price and marketing office ZMP wrote in a weekly report.

"Asian demand in the global market is the main reason," it said. "It will partially offset a typical seasonal price decline when the Latin American crops come in next spring."

The impact of higher U.S. soybean crop estimates in recent weeks had been countered by renewed demand from China and the strength of the dollar against European currencies.

This week prices reached 450 marks a tonne ex-trade in north Germany, their highest since late 1989, and were still rising.

In November prices averaged 430.50 marks.

Average U.S. soybean prices cif Rotterdam were $285.40 in November 1996 compared with $282 in November 1995, ZMP noted.

Brazilian soymeal (48 percent protein), at $294.25 in November 1996, was sharply higher than a year earlier at $223.75 and Argentinian soymeal (44/45 percent) cost $270.75 on average, up from $229.75 a year earlier.

ZMP said the European Union was forecast to import 15.10 million tonnes of soybeans in Oct/Sept 1996/97, up from 14.16 million in 1995/96.

Soymeal imports were seen fallling to 10.90 million tonnes from 12.23 million in the previous season.

But Asian demand would more than compensate for the lower EU figure.
