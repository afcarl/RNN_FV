<p>Northern European soymeal prices are likely to stay firm for the next few months, German farm price and marketing office ZMP wrote in a weekly report.</p>
<p>&quot;Asian demand in the global market is the main reason,&quot; it said. &quot;It will partially offset a typical seasonal price decline when the Latin American crops come in next spring.&quot;</p>
<p>The impact of higher U.S. soybean crop estimates in recent weeks had been countered by renewed demand from China and the strength of the dollar against European currencies.</p>
<p>This week prices reached 450 marks a tonne ex-trade in north Germany, their highest since late 1989, and were still rising.</p>
<p>In November prices averaged 430.50 marks.</p>
<p>Average U.S. soybean prices cif Rotterdam were $285.40 in November 1996 compared with $282 in November 1995, ZMP noted.</p>
<p>Brazilian soymeal (48 percent protein), at $294.25 in November 1996, was sharply higher than a year earlier at $223.75 and Argentinian soymeal (44/45 percent) cost $270.75 on average, up from $229.75 a year earlier.</p>
<p>ZMP said the European Union was forecast to import 15.10 million tonnes of soybeans in Oct/Sept 1996/97, up from 14.16 million in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Soymeal imports were seen fallling to 10.90 million tonnes from 12.23 million in the previous season.</p>
<p>But Asian demand would more than compensate for the lower EU figure.</p>
