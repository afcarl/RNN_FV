EU ministers study draft treaty amid British turmoil.

European Union foreign ministers met on Friday to discuss a draft EU treaty, viewed for the most part as uncontroverisal, but still expected to stir political dissension in Britain.

With British Prime Minister John Major facing turmoil in his ruling Conservative Party over Europe, most eyes were expected to focus on London's problems with the draft, which is to be presented to the summit on December 13 and 14.

Seen from continental Europe, the draft is no more than a report on the state of negotiations for a treaty to be agreed next June.

No commitment by countries is being sought at this stage, and the Irish EU presidency has deliberately left the most controversial areas vague to avoid a clash at the summit.

Britain has nonetheless indicated that it is unhappy with various aspects of the draft, especially the suggestion that Europe should lower all its internal borders by 2002.

Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said when arriving at the meeting that he was pleased with initial reaction from most member states to the proposal, which was put forward on Thursday.

Asked whether it would be possible to reach a compromise, especially in view of British scepticism about further EU integration and the fact that elections in Britain must be held before May, he told reporters:

"I think in terms of the interests of the citizens of Europe that we should work very hard to ensure we have the necessary compromise in Amsterdam."

The paper puts forward draft treaty texts on most issues apart from some of the most contentious items, such as more majority voting in EU decision-making and a "flexibility clause" that would allow some member states to move ahead faster than others.

Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said the Irish presidency had done a good job but forecast tough negotiations.

"We are very far from a solution," he told reporters. "(But) this is a good beginning."

He said the Irish paper contained elements which were good from a Danish point of view, such as the text on unemployment, openness of EU institutions and the environment.

There were also elements which were not acceptable for Denmark. Asked whether this concerned the pooling of sovereignty, he said: "That is an element which could be difficult for us."

Denmark is known to be cool about too much integration.

The ministers were also to discuss preparations for a summit between the EU and the United States on December 16 in Washington, relations with Switzerland and the Middle East.

They are expected to continue to hold off giving rump Yugoslavia, which comprises Serbia and Montenegro, the preferential trade status granted to other countries in the region.
