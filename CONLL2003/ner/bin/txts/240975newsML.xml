<p>Belgium's political leaders, widely denounced over their handling of revelations of child sex and murder, were due to meet on Saturday in an attempt to prevent the country's government system collapsing.</p>
<p>Facing proof of bungling in investigations into a series of child disappearances that led to the arrest in August of rapist Marc Dutroux and prompted talk of a cover-up, the president of parliament has called a summit of the political elite.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a crisis in the system and something must really be done,&quot; Parliament President Raymond Langendries explained.</p>
<p>But only the mainstream parties have agreed to take part.</p>
<p>The francophone and Flemish greens have refused to come, arguing the meeting would be an exercise in maintaining the status quo, rather than the start of a revolution. The feeling was echoed by some newspapers.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you see them sitting next to one another...the old crocodiles who are supposed to define the outlines of a new political culture? People who are so thoroughly a part of the old system...are now supposed to reinvent political virginity,&quot; De Morgen newspaper said in an editorial.</p>
<p>But with only two days before parliament is due to decide whether to send francophone socialist Deputy Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo to court over allegations he had sex with under-age boys, the backdrop to the meeting is tense.</p>
<p>Di Rupo denies the allegations. Belgian media have seriously questioned the reliability of the sole known witness although new evidence was handed to the country's top court on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Belgium's coalition government is made up of the flemish and francophone christian democratic and socialist parties.</p>
<p>In reality the politicians have little choice but to endorse change.</p>
<p>In October some 250,000 people took to the streets of Brussels in a demonstration called to show support for the parents of the two young girls who were rescued from Dutroux's house, the four others who were found dead and at least seven still missing.</p>
<p>But the so-called white march quickly turned into a demonstration of disgust at a political and legal system widely seen as corrupt and self-serving.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene promised rapid change, but the evidence of incompetence and suspicions of worse now coming out at a parliamentary inquiry into earlier Dutroux investigations have raised the temperature further.</p>
<p>This week alone the parliamentarians have heard witnesses from the judiciary who were involved in the hunt for missing girls swear they had never even heard of Dutroux despite the fact that the gendarmerie had copious files on his activities.</p>
<p>Dutroux was released on parole in 1992 from a 13-year sentence for a series of rapes, some involving children.</p>
<p>Dutroux had a record and had no visible means of support but owned six houses. At least one witness had sworn he had been offered 150,000 francs ($5,000) by him to kidnap a child, and the gendarmerie ran a surveillance operation against hims for two years. Nonetheless, magistrates swore they knew nothing.</p>
<p>Investigators who interviewed Dutroux at home last December about car thefts did not know of his child sex past and made no link when they heard children's voices in the house.</p>
<p>It was later established that eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo were being held in the house at the time.</p>
<p>When Dutroux was then imprisoned for car thefts, authorities turned off the water supply to the house.</p>
<p>Julie and Melissa were found in August having starved to death while Dutroux was in jail.</p>
<p>When gendarmes gave evidence to the parliamentarians on Tuesday they insisted on doing it behind closed doors.</p>
