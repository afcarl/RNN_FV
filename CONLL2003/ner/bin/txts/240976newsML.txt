Buba official-late Euro switch likely for pensions.

FRANKFURT 1996-12-06

German pensioners will likely receive pensions denominated in marks until December 31, 2001, Bundesbank council member Franz-Christoph Zeitlera said on Friday.

Social security payments will probably not be converted into Euros, the new European currency until the end of the three-year switch-over period, he told a group of public service officials.

Zeitler, also president of the state central bank in Bavaria, said "public finances which include social security payments will likely only adopt the Euro at the end of the three-year switch-over period as the new currency will only become visible to citizens at that time."

Zeitler said it would be useful if social security offices notified citizens of what their payments will be in marks as well as Euros.

"This would give citizens a feeling for the value of the new currency," he said.
