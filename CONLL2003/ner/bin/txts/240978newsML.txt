STOCKHOLM 1996-12-06

Swedish appliance maker Electrolux said on Friday that it would merger the appliance and outdoor product businesses of American Yard Products, Frigidaire Co and Poulan/Weed Eater in the U.S. and Canada.

Electrolux said the merger, to take effect from January 1, 1997, was part of a strategy to adapt structures and operations to take advantage of group strengths across all business sectors and geographical boundaries.

"This new structure will allow Electrolux to capitalise on and develop synergies in these two core business areas," Electrolux said.

It said Hans Backman has been named to lead the process across the Electrolux group.

Robert Cook has been appointed president of the combined organisation.

"We are entering a new phase of development for major appliances and outdoor products in North America," said Leif Johansson, Electrolux president and chief executive officer.

"Our customers will benefit from better service and support and from continued new product introductions."
