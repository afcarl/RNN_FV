Buba official sees stability pact's importance.

FRANKFURT 1996-12-06

A stability pact, ensuring long-term fiscal austerity, needs to be a key pillar for Europe's currency union to be a success, a senior Bundesbank official said on Friday.

In excerpts from a speech prepared for delivery to public service officials, Bundesbank council member Franz-Christoph Zeitler again underscored the need for measures to ensure ongoing stability after the currency union is launched.

"A stability pact needs to be a key and supporting pillar of the European currency union's architecture," Zeitler, also president of the state central bank in Bavaria, said.
