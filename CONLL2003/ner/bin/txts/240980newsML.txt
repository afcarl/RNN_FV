No agreement seen on veal crates this year.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

A proposal to ban all veal crates for rearing calves from 2008 is unlikely to be agreed by farm ministers this month, EU diplomats said on Friday.

They said the Irish EU Presidency this week passed the proposal back to a working group after France and Italy continued to express strong opposition, saying it would cause economic hardship for their farmers.

The Netherlands, which also uses veal crates, could support the proposal if a better balance is struck between animal welfare and producers' interests. Belgium also uses crates.

"The Presidency is reluctant to try to force through the proposal against opposition from the two major veal crate producer countries," said one diplomat.

Germany, Austria and Britain are strongly in favour of the proposal (COM(96)21) which would phase out veal crates over 10 years starting in 1998.

Sweden, Denmark and Finland have also banned veal crates, which are seen as causing unnecessary suffering to animals due to their confinement in cramped conditions and milky diet lacking iron and other nutrients.
