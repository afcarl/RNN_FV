Danish shipping giant A.P.Moeller said on Friday that it had sold five refined petroleum and gas tankers to Germany's Bernhard Schulte group.

A.P. Moeller would not give further details, but Danish shipping magazine Soefart said that the five 'R'-type vessels sold for a combined 95 million dollars.

Soefart said that they would remain in service with Moeller's Maersk Tankers under a time-charter arrangement running for the next five years.
