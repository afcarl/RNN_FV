<p>Norway's Nobel Committee will next Tuesday hand over the 1996 Peace Prize to two campaigners for human rights in East Timor (corrects to delete reference to campaigning for independence) in the hope the move will influence a peace settlement in the Indonesia-ruled territory.</p>
<p>Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo and resistance leader Jose Ramos-Horta will be given the Nobel gold medals and $1.12 million prize money awarded for their efforts to find a peaceful solution to the East Timor conflict.</p>
<p>A senior official at the Nobel Institute said there was evidence the prestigious prize could have political influence in the territory, ruled since 1976 by Indonesia in defiance of the United Nations.</p>
<p>&quot;The Peace Prize has already had influence on the situation in East Timor. There is an increased eagerness by the Indonesian authorities to consider dialogue, but how far that will go and what form it will take is too early to say,&quot; said Institute Research Director Odd Arne Westad.</p>
<p>Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed it a year later.</p>
<p>The outspoken Belo has defended his parishioners against human rights violations by the Indonesian military and has restrained radical Timorese youths from confronting the authorities.</p>
<p>Ramos-Horta, who fled the country days before the invasion, has worked in international fora for East Timor's cause. He heads the formal resistance movement, which comprises several political groups working for independence.</p>
<p>The committee last October said the award aimed to influence the drawn-out conflict. Its decision provoked sharp criticism from Indonesia but won global praise.</p>
<p>This year's award, marking the 100th anniversary of the death of the prize's founder, Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, is only the eighth to be given in the Asian region, including the Middle East.</p>
<p>The first Asian to win the vote of the Nobel committee was North Vietnamese peace mediator Le Duc Tho in 1973, who declined the honour because he shared it with then U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.</p>
<p>Others on the list include Mother Teresa of Calcutta in 1979, Tibet's exiled spiritual and political leader the Dalai Lama in 1989 and Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi in 1991.</p>
<p>The Nobel Prizes for Physics, Chemstry, Medicine, Literature and Economic Science will be awarded also on Tuesday in a separate ceremony in the Swedish capital of Stockholm.</p>
