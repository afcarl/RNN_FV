MoDo to decide about Domsjo plant in '98.

STOCKHOLM 1996-12-06

Swedish forestry group MoDo AB said on Friday that it will wait to decide about whether or not to close down operations in Domsjo and expand the nearby Husum mill until the autumn of 1998.

"A decision about industrial structure in the Ornskoldsvik aera (which includes both Domsjo and Husum) will be on the cards in 1998, most likely during the autumn," MoDo's chief executive Bengt Pettersson said in a statement.

At that time, internal research about the situation is expected to be finalised, Pettersson said.

Pettersson reiterated his view that both investments and raw material supplies should be concentrated to one unit to enable getting a long-term and internationally viable industrial structure in the Ornskoldsvik region.

"I mean that this unit should be Husum," he said, adding that an expansion application will be filed with environmental authorities next spring.

When Pettersson launched the idea of closing down the Domsjo mill and expand the Husum plant on October 7 this year, it upset the community, employees and unions.

Although Pettersson informed MoDo's board about his plans to propose the change, the board has not yet decided upon any measures.
