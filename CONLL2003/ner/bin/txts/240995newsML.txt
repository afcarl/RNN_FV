Munich Re sees 96/97 profits just down.

MUNICH, Germany 1996-12-06

Muenchener Rueckversicherungs AG, the world's largest reinsurance group, on Friday predicted its group profits might drop slightly in 1996/1997, but said a dividend payout of 16 marks was secure.

Management board chairman Hans Juergen Schinzler said in a text prepared for delivery at a shareholders' meeting that group earnings would "not quite reach" the year-ago level in the business year ending June 30, 1997.  

Schinzler added, however, that a dividend payout of 16 marks, the same as was paid out on 1995/1996 earnings, "is also secured for the current year, from the present perspective."

The group, known as Munich Re, hiked its dividend significantly last year to 16 marks from 13.50 marks and is widely expected to keep the dividend around this level for some time.

Schinzler also said that its reinsurance subsidiaries were unlikely to match their good earnings for 1995/1996 in the current business year. So far, the group's underwriting earnings position looked much the same as last year, he said.

On premium income, Schinzler said premiums would rise by around two billion marks in the current business year from just under 29 billion marks in 1995/1996, largely due to its consolidation of health insurer Deutsche Krankenversicherungs AG, or DKV, which the company bought this year.

Munich Re posted a sharp rise in profits in the 1995/1996 business year, when earnings per share more than doubled to 140 marks and its net profit surged to 595 million marks from 325 million marks.
