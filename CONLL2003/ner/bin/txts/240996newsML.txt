GM says VW has responsibility for settlement.

FRANKFURT 1996-12-06

General Motors Corp and its German unit Adam Opel AG, reiterated that Volkswagen AG needs to take "fundamental steps" if any out of court settlement is to be reached in a civil action the American firms have brought.

GM said that such steps included acknowledgment by VW that Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua had acted wrongly while working for VW and that the carmaker should sever business relations with him and other executives who left GM to join VW.  

"These steps do not threaten, and are not meant to cause any threat to, the jobs of innocent Volkswagen employees, but do begin to address the negative effects the wrongful conduct has had on the employees of Opel," GM said in a statement.

GM also criticized the request of an attorney representing Lopez in the U.S. for a stay in GM's civil suit.

"GM and Opel continue to seek a judicial determination of the truth as expeditiously as possible in the VW/Lopez case, and believe that the appropriate forum to argue the facts and evidence is in courts of law," GM statement.

The anticipated criminal charges against Lopez stem from allegations that he stole confidential documents when he left GM and joined VW in 1993.

Lopez resigned from the German car maker, Europe's largest, last week, saying he wanted to concentrate on his defence and set up a consulting company.

In addition to pending court proceedings in the U.S., Lopez also faces charges in Germany. A public prosecutor here said on Thursday that a decision on whether or not to file criminal charges will be made some time in mid-December.
