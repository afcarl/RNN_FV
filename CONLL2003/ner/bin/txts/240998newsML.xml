<p>U.S. Treasury bonds, once they have recovered from the shock of the sharp spike lower, are set to outperform German Bunds, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>T-bonds sparked a global bond sell-off after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in financial markets. However, a lower-than-expected payrolls figure soothed those concerns and raised hopes the recent rally could continue.</p>
<p>&quot;It may take a little while for the market to recover its nerves but these employment figures do continue with the soft landing picture,&quot; said George Magnus, chief international economist at UBS in London. &quot;The economic data will tend to support a perhaps erratic but rising trend in Treasury bonds.&quot;</p>
<p>The 30-year long bond was trading at 99-20 by 1515 GMT, yielding 6.53 percent.</p>
<p>The U.S. Labour Department said the number of people joining the payroll in November rose by 118,000, below market forecasts of 179,000. The unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent in October.</p>
<p>Analysts said these figures showed few signs of the U.S. economy overheating and investors could be wooed back into the Treasury market.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that this report was weaker than expected means investors will be encouraged to buy again,&quot; said Michael O'Hanlon, chief international economist at Paine Webber in London. &quot;It will add to stability at the lower levels, and allow the rally to continue.&quot;</p>
<p>He expected U.S. Treasuries to outperform core European markets, with the yield spread of 10-year T-notes versus German Bunds to narrow to 35/40 basis points by the year end from a current level of more than 50 basis points.</p>
<p>&quot;More and more people are looking for bond value - and with yields so low they need to buy higher yielding assets to provide sufficient returns,&quot; said O'Hanlon.</p>
<p>Adam Chester, international bond strategist at Yamaichi International in London said the long bond yield was targeting 6.25 percent on a three-month timescale, although dealers may be unwilling to push the market much further this year.</p>
<p>Analysts said further gains for Treasuries would also be dependent on the strength of data scheduled for release next week. November producer prices were due on Wednesday and consumer prices on Thursday.</p>
<p>Chester noted that there was still a shadow cast over the equities market, which could feed into the bond market.</p>
<p>U.S. blue chip share prices have soared 25 percent this year, leading some analysts to worry that the market may be setting itself up for a crash that could cripple the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Bonds are generally good value on a safe haven view,&quot; said Chester. &quot;Greenspan has marked the equity market's cards, and there may well be reallocation of assets.&quot;</p>
<p>Magnus said that markets were concerned Greenspan was flagging a more cautious Fed policy -- including the possibility of a rise in U.S. interest rates to calm down speculative fever in the equity market.</p>
<p>&quot;People are reacting in a knee-jerk way, but at the end of the day the Fed will only raise interest rates if there does seem to be a rising tide of economic growth which carries with it the risk of inflation,&quot; said Magnus.</p>
