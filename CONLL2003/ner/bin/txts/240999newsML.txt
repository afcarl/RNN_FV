Tumbling French stocks close 2.26 percent down.

PARIS 1996-12-06

French shares closed a dramatic trading day 2.26 percent down on Friday in a huge volume of 11.2 billion francs after a mass sell-off on remarks by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.

The sell-off brought the French market down from near historic highs and many fund managers took profits in order to hold on to the gains made so far. So far in 1996, the CAC has gained 19.7 percent.

The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 51.78 points or 2.26 percent at 2,240.72 while the CAC-40 futures contract was down at 2,239 vs 2,294 on Thursday's close.

The CAC-40 index fell as low as 2,180 on Friday, or down by more than 100 points.

The only CAC-40 share to end the day with a gain was defence electronics group Thomson-CSF, 58-percent owned by Thomson SA, which closed 1.3 percent up at 164.10 francs.

The French government on Wednesday suspended the privatisation sale of Thomson SA because the independent Privatisation Commission challenged the terms of the sale of consumer electronics unit Thomson Multimedia (TMM) to Daewoo of South Korea. Dealers are expecting the government will now sell Thomson-CSF and TMM seperately and expect a buyout bid.

The market had plunged from the opening on the back of comments made by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, during a dinner in Washington after Wall Street had closed, warning markets against "irrational exuberance".

The market also suffered from later comments by Bundesbank member Reimut Jochimsen that there was no need for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth and that the German economy was not yet strong enough for self-sustained growth.

Market analysts said they had expected a correction because Paris was close to historic highs, but not a one-day plunge.

Analysts at Paribas, CSFB and J.P. Morgan said their year-end target for the CAC-40 remained 2,200.

"December is not going to be brilliant. The market is still expensive when compared with other markets and there at no signs of any recovery in economic fundamentals that would justify the profit expectations," said Jean-Luc de Lamaze, an analyst who follows the French market for CSFB in London.

"Recently there have been uncertainties on the monetary front and the Thomson decision has damaged the country's reputation in the eyes of investors," he added.
