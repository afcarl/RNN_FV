<p>Japan and the United States on Friday failed to bridge wide differences over the bilateral dispute on the deregulation of Tokyo's insurance market in their last-ditch efforts to resolve the issue before a December 15 deadline, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are certainly wide differences between us,&quot; Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told reporters after negotiations with Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka.</p>
<p>They started a ministerial meeting on Monday and are scheduled to meet again on Saturday, which both sides have said would be the last opportunity to meet before the deadline.</p>
<p>Emerging from the first meeting with Mitsuzuka, Barshefsky said, however, that the meeting was &quot;constructive.&quot;</p>
<p>The dispute has become a major irriant between the two countries, and could escalate into a damaging trade fight with threats of sanctions that has marked U.S.-Japan relations in the past, if the dispute is not settled by the deadline.</p>
<p>The fight centers on U.S. charges that Japan is planning to renege on a 1994 trade agreement on the deregulation of its $400 billion insurance market.</p>
<p>Asked if they can reach an agreement during the latest round of talks, Mitsuzuka said, &quot;It's very difficult do do so.&quot;</p>
<p>Barshefsky said senior officials of the USTR and the Finance Ministry will continue to work toward an agreement before her next meeting with Mitsuzuka on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall see whether further progress can be made. But there are very, very difficult issues,&quot; Barshefsky said.</p>
<p>Japan allowed subsidiaries of domestic life and non-life insurers to start operations in each other's turfs on October 1, but barred them from selling some products in the third sector market -- stand-alone cancer, hospitalisation, nursing care and personal accident insurance -- before January 1.</p>
<p>Washington has argued that the 1994 agreement calls for Tokyo to deregulate the huge primary life and casualty insurance sector, which is dominated by Japanese companies, before unleasing competition in the tiny specialty insurance market.</p>
<p>But the Tokyo government has proposed first deregulating the foreign-dominated sector. U.S. insurers like American International Group have a firm foothold in the lucrative third sector.</p>
<p>Last month, President Bill Clinton told Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in a meeting on the fringes of a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Manila that the row over deregulation of Japan's insurance market was their most important two-way trade problem.</p>
