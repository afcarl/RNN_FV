Thomson stakeholders approve capital rise.

PARIS 1996-12-06

French state-controlled electronics company Thomson SA said in a statement on Friday that its shareholders meeting had approved a planned increase in the share capital of 11 billion francs ($2.1 billion) -- essentially a state cash injection to the indebted group.

The shareholders, representatives for the state, France Telecom and the CDR holding which manages former Credit Lyonnais, said the state would be the only investor for the capital increase.

It said the subscription period for the rise, initially set at December 31, had been extended to April 30, 1997.

There are also a few banks represented by the state-owned Caisse des Depots et de Consignations.

A company source said that the meeting had not decided a split of the capital increase over 100-percent owned consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM) and 58-percent owned Thomson-CSF.

At end-1995, Thomson SA had debts of 25.3 billion francs of which 13.8 billion were at TMM and 2.3 billion at Thomson-CSF. ($ = 5.192 French Francs)
