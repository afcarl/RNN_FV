<p>The United States will play host to a special meeting Monday at the WTO summit in Singapore to seek backing for a global pact on liberalising telecommunications, Federal Commuunications Chiarman Reed Hundt said Friday.</p>
<p>Hundt told a news briefing the United States would host a closed-door meeting of about 30 countries Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Representatives will come from developed nations and the more advanced developing states, he said.</p>
<p>The aim is to &quot;see if there is a reasonable prospect&quot; for reaching an agreement on a global information initiative within the group on basic telecommunications by a Feb. 15 deadline.</p>
<p>Singapore is host to the World Trade Organisation's first high-level meeting since the global trade regulatory body replaced its predecessor, the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade, in January 1995.</p>
<p>About 4,000 officials from 160 countries are expected to attend the Dec. 9-13 gathering in the prosperous city-state.</p>
<p>Hundt said the information initiative and an Information Technology Agreement were cornerstones of a U.S. drive to liberalise global trade and use of computers and telecommunications.</p>
<p>The United States won an agreement from the other 17 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting in the Philippines last month for the inclusion of an Information Technology Agreement at the Singapore meeting.</p>
<p>Hundt described the agreement as &quot;the cars and trucks of the information highway&quot; and said reports he had received made him &quot;pretty hopeful about the status of the ITA as of now.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the key issues included:</p>
<p>-- Dropping limits on foreign ownership of telecommunications;</p>
<p>-- Independent regulatory agencies in the different countries following the rule of law that allow networks to interconnect at reasonable prices; and</p>
<p>-- Access to telecommunications markets.</p>
<p>Hundt said Washington's approach was &quot;like sitting in a hot bath and telling the others to jump in.&quot;</p>
<p>If they complain the water is too hot, &quot;they will soon get used to it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the United States was also considering ways to induce other countries to lower their telecommunications rates.</p>
<p>Developed countries, he said, made outpayments of between $10 billion and $15 billion a year to cover the higher phone charges from developing countries.</p>
<p>Hundt said outpayments from the United States alone amounted to around $5.5 billion per year, which he described as a serious drain on the U.S. balance of payments.</p>
<p>&quot;If we don't do something about it, it will be $8 billion to $10 billion in a few years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the goal was for telecommunications rates to be the same for everyone, although the process of achieving this could be different from country to country.</p>
