China, Cuba to top EU-U.S. talks.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

The European Union agreed on Friday to make trade with China and its future membership in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) a top issue at an upcoming summit with the United States, a European Commission official said.

Foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels, also said they would use the summit in Washington on December 16 to reinforce the bloc's opposition to U.S. anti-Cuba legislation.

The official said the ministers had agreed that China's role in the WTO should be made part of the main discussion at the summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton, Commission President Jacques Santer and Irish Prime Minister John Bruton.

Ireland is the current EU president.

"This is the highest-level discussion we will have had on China and the WTO," the official said.

China indicated in recent meetings with EU officials that it wants to renew its WTO membership drive. The EU wants to gauge America's attitude and perhaps to forge a common approach to Beijing.

In other issues at the U.S. summit, the EU is expected to emphasise progress made between the two sides over the past year, but also to raise issues of contention.

Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said the summit would focus on "the deeper relationship and address the irritations" between the two sides," the official said.

Chief among these is the Helms-Burton act, an amalgam of anti-Cuba legislation designed to bring Cuba to democracy.

The EU and many of Washington's other trading partners object to aspects of the legislation that threaten foreign companies doing certain types of business with Cuba.
