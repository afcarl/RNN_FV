Dutch shares end nightmare session way above lows.

AMSTERDAM 1996-12-06

Dutch shares ended a traumatic Friday session well above the lows, first slumping on remarks overnight from Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, before rebounding sharply on better than expected U.S. jobs figures.

The AEX index closed 12.18 points or 1.94 percent lower at 616.26, battling back from an earlier 38.71 point drop to 589.73 as panic sellers scrambled to save profits from the rally which sent the AEX to its record high of 636.75 on Tuesday.

"It's been all over the place today," said one dealer, describing hectic trading conditions. "I've seen clients earn and lose a fortune in just five minutes."

Greenspan said the Fed must be wary of the potential damage to the economy when "irrational exuberance" takes a grip of financial markets.

Analysts said this had raised fears that the Fed could believe that markets were overheating, with possible implications for a tightening of U.S. monetary policy.

"Quite a few people had assumed that the Fed would go lower. This speech diminishes the chances of a decline in the Fed funds rate," said Cees Rijsdijk, an economist at Suez Nederland. "The Fed will not ease its monetary policy soon, that's the basic conclusion to be drawn," he added.

News U.S. non-farm payrolls rose 118,000 in November, much less than the expected 179,000 rise, helped soothe frayed nerves in a market which was already up from the day's lows on a feeling that the early fall was overdone.

Dealers also said the controlled early fall on Wall Street -- less than the anticipated 100 point fall by the time the Amsterdam market closed at 1530 GMT -- sent dealers home relatively satisfied on Friday, although Wall Street's close tonight would be key in setting Monday's tone.

"If Wall Street holds its losses to less than 100 points tonight we could see some recovery," said another dealer.
