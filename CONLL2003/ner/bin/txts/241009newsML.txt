Swedish shares end down, but off lows, on U.S..

STOCKHOLM 1996-12-06

Swedish shares ended off day lows on Friday in relief after Wall Street did not open as low as feared.

The exchange's general index fell 1.58 percent to 2,287.35 from a day-earlier record high. But the index recovered late in the session from a day low of 2,235.19.

In line with market trends, drugs major Astra rebounded somewhat from day lows and ended 4.5 crowns lower at 332 crowns after rising nine crowns on Thursday.

Telecommunications group Ericsson dropped 4.5 crowns to 199 crowns.

Astra and Ericsson dominated the trade with 2.1 billion crowns of total turnover, which landed at the high level of 6.25 billion crowns.

During the day, the market was depressed by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warning of "irrational exuberance" infecting financial markets.

But dealers and analysts expect the downturn to be shortlived and see the market stablising in a few days.

Among sectors, the building and construction and forestry groups were the hardest hit, down 2.22 percent and 2.11 percent, respectively.
