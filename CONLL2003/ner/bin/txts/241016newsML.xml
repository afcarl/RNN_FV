<headline>Stocks fall after Greenspan remarks spook markets.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Stocks fell early Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in asset markets worried investors and caused a sell-off at stock exchanges around the world.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 59.63 points to 6,377.47 in the first few minutes of trading. In the broader market, declining issues swamped advances on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq composite index tumbled 35.06 points to 1,265.06.  </p>
<p>Stocks had been expected to open sharply lower after Greenspan's remarks. The central bank chairman, in a speech in Washington on Thursday night, stopped short of directly referring to the recent stock market rally but analysts expressed little doubt about the impact of his message.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't look good,&quot; Hildegard Zagorski, market analyst at Prudential Securities, said just before the opening. &quot;I think what happened is Greenspan is trying to talk the market down,&quot; she said. &quot;The (Dow's) going down 100 points.&quot;</p>
<p>Stocks in London, Paris, Frankfurt and Tokyo tumbled overnight after Greenspan's remarks suggested that current levels might be overdone.</p>
<p>Bond prices also fell, though they later recovered some ground, and the dollar also weakened.</p>
