Turkish shares firm 0.52 pct to new record.

ISTANBUL 1996-12-06

Istanbul shares firmed an average 0.52 percent on continued selective activity on Friday, with the index hitting the week's fourth all-time high close.

The IMKB-100 closed at 94,407.22, up 484.18 points from Thursday's previous record of 93,923.04. Over the week, it rose 2.89 percent after a 5.49 percent surge last week when it hit five closing records in a row.

Trade volume eased was higher at 17.68 trillion lira ($171.5 million) after 15.97 trillion ($154 million) on Thursday.

In dollar terms, the index firmed to $0.92 cents from $0.90 on Thursday and compared to a record of $1 on April 8 and $0.67 at the end of 1995.

"The market looks positive with an inner dynamism. Activity in shares of largely state owned firms has spilled over to a few other stocks amid end-1996 profit outlooks of companies," said Murat Emrali from Eczacibasi securities.

"But activity was highly selective and the market may remain squeezed next week, although selective buys based on profit prospects will continue," he added.

Despite the increase in the index, losers outdid gainers by 109 to 74 among the 229 shares traded, while 46 ended stable.
