<p>Istanbul shares firmed an average 0.52 percent on continued selective activity on Friday, with the index hitting the week's fourth all-time high close.</p>
<p>The IMKB-100 closed at 94,407.22, up 484.18 points from Thursday's previous record of 93,923.04. Over the week, it rose 2.89 percent after a 5.49 percent surge last week when it hit five closing records in a row.</p>
<p>Trade volume eased was higher at 17.68 trillion lira ($171.5 million) after 15.97 trillion ($154 million) on Thursday.</p>
<p>In dollar terms, the index firmed to $0.92 cents from $0.90 on Thursday and compared to a record of $1 on April 8 and $0.67 at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The market looks positive with an inner dynamism. Activity in shares of largely state owned firms has spilled over to a few other stocks amid end-1996 profit outlooks of companies,&quot; said Murat Emrali from Eczacibasi securities.</p>
<p>&quot;But activity was highly selective and the market may remain squeezed next week, although selective buys based on profit prospects will continue,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Despite the increase in the index, losers outdid gainers by 109 to 74 among the 229 shares traded, while 46 ended stable.</p>
