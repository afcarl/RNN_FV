PRAGUE PSE ACCEPTS PRAZDROJ TO SECOND MKT.

PRAGUE 1996-12-06

The Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) said on Friday it had approved a request of brewer Plzensky Prazdroj a.s. for listing on the bourse's parallel market.

Pavla Vodstrcilova of the PSE's listing committee said Prazdroj originally applied for listing on the bourse's main market but later changed its request.

"We considered the request for the parallel market, and it (Prazdroj) was accepted there," Vodstcilova told Reuters.    

Companies traded on the parallel market have to fulfil reporting obligations. The PSE will require all parallel market companies to publish financial results quarterly as of January, while currently they have to reveal financial statements only semi-annually.

Firms listed on the least-regulated free market, where Prtazdroj has been quoted, have to publish results once a year.
