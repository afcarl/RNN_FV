<p>British manufacturing output shifted up a gear in October, official figures showed on Friday, keeping up pressure on the government to raise interest rates again before the general election.</p>
<p>But economists said the troubled sector was not out of the woods yet and the recent rise in the pound may jeopardise the fragile recovery.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics said output rose 0.5 percent in October after a 0.3 percent rise in September. The wider measure of industrial production, which includes utilities' and manufacturers output, was unchanged in October.</p>
<p>The Conservative government, which is hoping a robust economic revival will be the trump card in its re-election campaign, warmly welcomed the data. &quot;The optimism of UK business surveys is now showing up in the growing strength of UK manufacturing activity,&quot; a Treasury official said.</p>
<p>But economists said the strength of the pound could prove a severe setback for the sector which relies heavily on export markets.</p>
<p>Firms have only recently seen tentative signs of recovery and the sector lags the lively activity seen in other areas of the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;If the surveys are to be believed, manufacturing output should stage a further recovery in the coming months,&quot; said HSBC economist Jonathan Loynes.</p>
<p>&quot;But the pick-up is still only fragile and a further rise in interest rates, renewing the pound's appreciation, could threaten to tip manufacuturing back towards recession.&quot;</p>
<p>The pound rose by around 12 percent on a trade weighted basis between August and the end of November, threatening to choke off demand for British exports by making them more expensive.</p>
<p>It sharply declined this week but is still 9.4 percent higher than in the summer.</p>
<p>Recent survey evidence from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply showed while export orders grew in November, the strong pound had dented activity in some parts of the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The pound's appreciation is the one dark spot on the horizon, but a strong domestic economy should at least help cushion the impact,&quot; said CIBC Wood Gundy economist David Coleman.</p>
<p>Britain's economic recovery has been fuelled by strong consumer demand, which is finally trickling down to manufacturers.</p>
<p>Until recently, however, firms have been reluctant to increase output, meeting new demand from the mountain of stocks they accumulated during the downturn.</p>
<p>&quot;The data...do support the view that the inventory overhang that hit growth earlier in the year has now been largely addressed,&quot; said Bank of America economist Jeremy Hawkins.</p>
<p>&quot;The overall picture is bright enough and UK outperformance versus most of the EU seems assured next year. This should...sustain pressure for higher base rates.&quot;</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke (finance minister) raised interest rates by a quarter point to 6.0 percent at the end of October and has been under pressure to sanction a further rise ahead of the general election, which must be held by May next year.</p>
<p>He meets Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George next week to discuss monetary policy. Most City economists expect George to call for another rate rise at the meeting, but a Reuter poll found a majority forecasted rates will stay on hold until next year.</p>
