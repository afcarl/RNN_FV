<p>Prime Minister John Major faced turmoil in his Conservative party on Friday, with members of parliament reported to be furious at his handling of European policy and his leadership under attack.</p>
<p>&quot;Meltdown&quot;, &quot;civil war&quot; and &quot;chaos&quot; were some of the front page headlines describing Major's woes on Friday.</p>
<p>Former Conservative minister, Edward Leigh, furious that Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke appeared to have won a cabinet showdown over a European currency, said Clarke was in a minority and Major had now to accept the will of the party.</p>
<p>One Conservative member of parliament opposed to closer European integration, the &quot;Eurosceptic&quot; Tony Marlow, even demanded Clarke's resignation as the anger normally expressed behind closed doors in parliament boiled over.</p>
<p>The opposition Labour party seized on Major's problems, saying his party, in power for 17 years, was falling apart.</p>
<p>In a further blow to Major, who has just 150 days at most to restore his political fortunes before a general election, a new poll showed Labour soaring ahead.</p>
<p>The Gallup poll showed Labour increased its lead by 10 points. Labour support rose four points to 59, while the Conservatives fell six points to 22.</p>
<p>The poll was even worse because it was calculated after last month's budget, designed to give the Conservative their final economic boost before the election.</p>
<p>But Clarke's one percent cut in the basic income tax rate to 23 percent failed to galvanise voters, and Labour attacked the budget for making optimistic assumptions about future growth.</p>
<p>Clarke's desperate efforts to find savings to fund tax cuts rebounded on Major again on Thursday.</p>
<p>The government accused the media of &quot;disgraceful&quot; and misleading reports over moves to block new claims for war disability pensions paid for hearing loss, moves designed to save up to 50 million pounds ($81.16 million) a year.</p>
<p>But rank and file Conservative MPs were infuriated, saying the &quot;mean&quot; moves would cost them votes.</p>
<p>This came on top of media reports of a threat by Clarke to resign.</p>
<p>If Clarke quit, it would likely force an early election it would be hard for Major -- currently nursing a parliamentary majority of just one -- to win.</p>
<p>Clarke denied the media reports, a denial backed up on Friday by Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, who told a BBC interviewer: &quot;Allegations were made, Ken Clarke has denied them, that's good enough for me, it should be good enough for you.&quot;</p>
<p>But his denial was undermined when it was revealed that the reports, first aired on the BBC, came after Clarke had lunched with two BBC journalists in a top London restaurant -- a lunch witnessed by a leading Labour politician at the next table.</p>
<p>Clarke had been angered by reports Major was considering hardening his line on Europe due to demands from Eurosceptics.</p>
<p>Major made clear earlier this week that he had ruled out any change of policy on a single European currency, a statement commentators put down to Clarke's threats. But Clarke's political hardball infuriated rank and file Conservative MPs.</p>
<p>Their fury erupted at a private meeting of Conservative MPs on Thursday night, where one was reported to have asked loudly: &quot;Who's running the government, Clarke or Major?&quot;</p>
<p>Another was reported by colleagues to have berated Major in a parliamentary canteen, snapping: &quot;Start running the country.&quot;</p>
<p>Edward Leigh underlined the feeling on Friday, telling the BBC: &quot;Ken Clarke is an excellent Chancellor, we want him to stay, but occasionally all of us are in a minority...</p>
<p>&quot;The majority will of the parliamentary party is now quite clear... we want to rule out a single currency and win the general election on that basis.&quot; ($1=.6161 Pound)</p>
