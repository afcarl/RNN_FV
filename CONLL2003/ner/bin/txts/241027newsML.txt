WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

The unemployment rate edged higher in November as the U.S. economy pumped out new jobs at a slower pace, the Labor Department said on Friday.

The department, in the government's first assessment of the economy's vitality in November, said unemployment rose to 5.4 percent in the month as some 118,000 new jobs were created.

The unemployment rate had been 5.2 percent in October and the economy had created a revised 224,000 jobs, previously reported as 210,000, the department said.
