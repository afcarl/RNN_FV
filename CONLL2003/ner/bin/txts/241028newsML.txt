Sweden's Telia AB, which launched Sri Lanka's first fixed private phone company this week despite domestic rancour, believes opposition will fade once people see there is room for newcomers, a company official said on Friday.

State-owned Telia, which aims to invest $100 million on a wireless local loop network, had spent about $55 million by the launch date of December 2 on preliminary infrastructure, said Jan Campbell, managing director of Telia-controlled local firm Suntel.

The launch of the local service, also called Suntel, has been met with resistance from employees of the state monopoly, Sri Lanka Telecom, who say rates benefit the foreign firm.

The independent Island newpaper said on Friday that Sri Lanka Telecom engineers objected to discounts on overseas calls and free access to the company's network for local calls, offered to private fixed-phone operators.

"Many objections are caused by Telecom employees believing that private companies will take away business from them," Campbell told Reuters.

This Indian Ocean island of 18 million people has about 230,000 Sri Lanka Telecom land lines, and a waiting list of more than 300,000, he said. Many have turned to more expensive mobile phones, now numbering about 50,000.

"You see, there is room for all to grow," said Campbell.

He said the rate structure heavily favoured Sri Lanka Telecom, but said Suntel was willing to comply for one year until December 1997 "in the interest of long-term development".

The rate structure for domestic calls allows Suntel to keep the entire revenue generated by calls originating on its network, while Sri Lanka Telecom gets all the revenue on calls originating on their network, Campbell said.

"The domestic structure is quite equitable, but the real hard one is the overseas calls," he said.

Since only Sri Lanka Telecom has the infrastructure for overseas calls, it gets 100 percent of the revenue on incoming overseas calls to Suntel subscribers, but Suntel has to pay 65 percent of revenue on outgoing overseas calls.

"There are three times more in-coming calls than out-going calls," Campbell said.

Suntel expects to have more than 100 telephones by the end of December. The company made a commitment to have 30,000 subscribers by the end of 1997 when they got the licence to operate in February this year.

"Prospects are good, but it will depend on how soon they can cover the island in the face of competition that will come from Bell Canada, and Sri Lanka Telecom after it is restructured," said Mahendra Jayasekera, general manager of brokerage CT Smith.

The government has advertised for strategic partners to take a 35 percent stake and management in Sri Lanka Telecom. A government official said about eight international telecom operators have already completed due diligence.

The Sri Lankan government gave licences to Telia and Bell Canada to operate the first fixed private telphones to improve the infrastructure needed to attract investment.

The companies are expected to each invest $100 million dollars and provide up to 200,000 lines in total, by the year 2000. Bell Canada is yet to launch its service.

Suntel is using wireless loop technology from Swedish telecoms giant Ericsson, Campbell said.

The system works on a radio signal and does not involve digging and laying land lines. This should make it more flexible and able to reach subscribers in areas land line operators find difficult to access.

"Before the end of 1997, Sri Lanka can boast of the world's biggest wireless local loop phone network," Campbell said.
