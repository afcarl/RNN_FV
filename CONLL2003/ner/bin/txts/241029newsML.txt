Diplomacy row jeopardises S.Africa-Taipei flights.

JOHANNESBURG 1996-12-06

South Africa's national air carrier, facing a suspension of its Taiwanese landing rights in a diplomatic row, said on Friday it would continue to fly direct to Taipei until official notice was issued by Taiwan.

South African Airways (SAA) has flown to Taipei for 13 years, spokesman Leon Els said.

"We've had no official notification of any cancellation of our bilateral agreement and we will at this stage continue with our twice-weekly flights to Taipei," Els told Reuters.

Taiwanese Foreign Minister John Chang announced on Thursday that the island state would suspend aid projects as well as 36 bilateral treaties with South Africa over Pretoria's switch of diplomatic links from Taipei to Beijing.

Chang pointed to Taiwan's air services agreement with South Africa as the "first one which comes to mind, on which we will take immediate action", adding that a date for the suspension would be decided after his return to Taipei.

Els said SAA had "taken note" of Chang's comments but added that under their bilateral agreement, 12 months' notice was required for a suspension.

If Taiwan took immediate action SAA would try to honour its bookings by flying to Hong Kong and making other arrangements there, Els said.

South Africa state radio reported on Friday that Taipei had given SAA 15 days to terminate its flights but this could not be confirmed.

South Africa was Taiwan's biggest diplomatic ally, and its defection to Beijing -- which refuses ties to any country that recognises Taiwan -- now leaves Taipei with diplomatic relations with just 29 minor nations.

Its relations with Taiwan date back to the apartheid era when both were diplomatic pariahs.

Chang was scheduled to meet several hundred Taiwanese businessmen with investments in South Africa later on Friday.
