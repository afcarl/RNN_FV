U.S. stocks in London fall, Dow plunge expected.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Investors were showing no buying interest in U.S. shares trading in London on Friday as stocks were marked down across the board in anticipation of a sharp sell-off in the U.S. later today.

"The Dow is looking sharply lower," said one senior trader. "down around 100 points at the opening, I expect."

December S&P futures were down 12 points by 1134 GMT.

Traders expected last night's note of caution from Fed chairman Alan Greenspan would shake the U.S. equity market and European bourses took heavy losses as investors braced themselves for a U.S. correction.
