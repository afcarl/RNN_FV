Farmers, defying a plea by Prime Minister Costas Simitis, continued a nine-day blockade of major highways protesting against Greece's austere 1997 budget and vowing to spend the Christmas holidays by the roadblocks.

Talks between the socialist government and representatives of the farmers broke down on Wednesday.
