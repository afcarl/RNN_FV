Tokyo stocks plunged nearly 700 points in frantic trade on Friday, their biggest fall in a year and a half, after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned of "irrational exuberance" in U.S. markets.

Fears of a possible Wall Street dive later on Friday provoked panic sales in Tokyo, sending indices into a tailspin. Japanese government bonds and the dollar were also hit.

"Greenspan's comment sparked fears about New York stock movements tonight and forced people to close their positions ahead of the weekend," said Chisato Takahashi, a fund manager at Credit Suisse Investment Advisory Co.

Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 index ended down more than three percent after Greenspan's comments on Thursday night, which came before the Tokyo opening, fuelled fears about recent euphoria on Wall Street.

The Nikkei shed 667.20 points to end at 20,276.70, having fallen as low as 20,171.69. It was the largest decline since April 3, 1995. Its December futures were 730 points lower at 20,210.

Greenspan had told a dinner meeting that the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets because that could end up doing damage to the economy.

"We as central bankers need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy, its production, jobs and price stability," he said.

Although Greenspan stopped short of commenting on the recent steep rise in Wall Street prices, dealers took the comment as a sign that the Fed was indeed concerned.

"People saw the comment as showing that the Fed thinks the present situation (in U.S. financial markets) is a bubble," said Yasuhito Kawashima, chief manager of foreign exchange at Toyo Trust & Banking Co.

Jesper Koll, chief economist at J.P. Morgan in Tokyo, said yen markets were "almost certainly overreacting".

"I think any dip below 20,500 is a buy as large-cap companies will pull off formidable earnings surprises in the coming six to 12 months," he said in a commentary.

The Fed holds its next policy-making meeting on December 17 and is widely expected to opt to hold interest rates steady amid signs of moderate economic growth with steady inflation.

Greenspan's remarks triggered heavy sales of the dollar because of fears that U.S. stocks and bonds would take a battering later on Friday, dealers said.

The dollar stood at around 111.89 yen and 1.5380 marks in late afternoon Tokyo, against New York closes of about 112.33 yen and 1.5495 marks.

Japanese government bonds, both cash and futures, also suffered, undermined by slumping U.S. Treasury bonds as well as large-lot selling by powerful institutional investors.

The key March JGB contract ended the session at 125.38 after dipping to a low of 125.10 from Thursday's 126.34. A hefty volume of 11.8385 trillion yen ($105 billion) was traded.

The key U.S. 30-year Treasury bond was down more than 1-1/3 points from New York's Thursday close and traded at 98-17/32 in late Tokyo.

Tokyo stocks had risen earlier in the day, aided by news that telecoms giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) would be split up into a long-distance company and two local-call firms under a single holding company.

The decision follows a decade of debate over how Japan can best compete in the increasingly global telecoms business.

The news boosted NTT shares, as well as some other blue-chip issues, such as Sony Corp. NTT shares ended up 15,000 yen ($133) at 845,000 yen ($7,544,). ($1=112 yen)
