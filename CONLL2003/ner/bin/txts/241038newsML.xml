<p>Shipments of U.S. gene-modified maize may already have arrived in Portugal and Spain in breach of EU rules, a European Union diplomat told reporters on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;According to our information from the European Commission, Spain and Portugal have already received shipments of maize,&quot; the diplomat said, referring to cargos containing corn from this year's U.S. harvest, the first to include a gene-modified strain made by Swiss chemicals company Ciba -Geigy AG.</p>
<p>The European Commission is due to decide on December 18 whether to allow imports of the modified maize, which Ciba Geigy has altered to make it resistant to the corn-borer pest and to increase its tolerance of certain weedkillers.</p>
<p>A Commission decision to clear the maize, which U.S. authorities have approved, will depend on advice from EU committees on food, animal feed and pesticides.</p>
<p>European Union environment ministers failed last June to agree on a French-backed proposal to approve the maize, with some citing fears related to the environmental effects of releasing the new strain and others saying that a &quot;marker gene&quot; used in the Ciba maize could undermine the effectiveness of an antibiotic used in animals and humans.</p>
<p>Commission environment spokesman Peter Jorgensen refused to say on Friday whether the EU executive had information indicating whether Portugal and Spain had received maize shipments containing the gene-modified strain.</p>
<p>He told a news conference that the EU's 15 member states were warned in writing on November 27 that it was their responsibility to stop such imports entering the bloc.</p>
