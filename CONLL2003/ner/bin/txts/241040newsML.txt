Gobal One wins Brussels bourse telecoms contract.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

The Brussels Stock Exchange said on Friday it had awarded an international telecommunications contract to Global One, the joint venture set up last year between Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and U.S. Sprint Corp.

Global One will supply secure lines for brokers in other European countries trading on the bourse's electronic share system via their own "remote" terminals, the Stock Exchange said in a statement. Terms were not disclosed.

The bourse's Robert Thys told Reuters the first "remote" member was ready to start trading in January. Other applications for remote membership were in the pipeline.
