<p>Germany's parliamentary mediation committee approved a compromise deal on the 1997 tax bill late on Thursday, clearing the way for the its passage and handing the government a victory over scrapping a wealth tax.</p>
<p>The mediation committee, made up of representatives from the two houses of parliament, agreed for 8.2 billion marks in tax increases to offset the loss of 9.3 billion marks in revenues to Germany's 16 states from dropping the wealth tax.</p>
<p>The tax bill should now go to a final parliamentary vote. With its passage, the final element of Finance Minister Theo Waigel's fiscal plans for 1997 -- when he wants Germany to qualify for European monetary union -- would fall into place.</p>
<p>The opposition Social Democrats (SPD), who control the Bundesrat upper house, had been blocking the abolition of the tax, which had been ruled illegal by the constitutional court.</p>
<p>But they finally caved in after leaders in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government threatened last week to let the tax bill fail -- which would have meant the tax would have been scrapped automatically at the start of 1997.</p>
<p>Negotiators from Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) welcomed the result, while the SPD said it still wanted to keep wealth taxes on private fortunes and would introduce legislation in parliament to do so.</p>
<p>Chief SPD negotiator, Hamburg mayor Henning Voscherau, said his party would keep up the pressure to maintain the private wealth tax in forthcoming parliamentary sessions -- and would also link the issue to planned reforms of company taxation.</p>
<p>Under the tax compromise, property dealing taxes will rise by more than originally planned, to 3.5 percent from two percent, raising revenues by 5.25 billion marks.</p>
<p>Higher inheritance tax rates will raise an extra 2.5 billion marks, while changes to corporation tax and subsidies for housing construction will raise a further 415 million.</p>
