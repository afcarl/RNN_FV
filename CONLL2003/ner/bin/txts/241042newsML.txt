Gold jumps on Greenspan, awaits Wall Street.

The price of gold surged on Friday as speculators anticipated a possible move of "hot" money into bullion if comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan unnerve Wall Street after spooking markets around the world.

Gold staged a dramatic recovery from three-year lows that were hit earlier this week, as stocks and bonds slid in reaction to Greenspan saying the Fed must be wary of "irrational exuberance" in asset markets.

Gold was fixed in London at $373.00 per ounce. That was up from $369.00 on Thursday and a three-year low around $366, touched in late trade on Tuesday amid speculative selling and talk that a central bank was also disposing of gold. "Anything that upsets calm in the financial markets is good for gold but gold was going up anyway before Greenspan spoke," said bullion analyst Andy Smith at Union Bank of Switzerland.

"The key thing for gold will be how Wall Street interprets his comments. By the time (New York) opens, they may seem a bit less dramatic than they were seen in the Far East." Dealers said that it would be quite bullish for gold if Wall Street falls. "The market is pretty illiquid on the upside," said one.

Dealers pointed to the British equity market where the FTSE100 stock index was down 75 points at the gold fix in anticipation of New York moving lower. It later dropped even further to stand more 100 points down.

"I'm surprised that the reaction has been quite so strong. All Greenspan was doing was repeating what people have been saying for weeks about the sheer height of the stock markets," said analyst Tony Warwick-Ching at research group CRU International.

Gold prices have been under pressure for several weeks from rumours of central banks selling and a daily dribble of metal on to the market by producers trying to protect themselves against falling prices.

Demand has also been weak at a time when it should strengthen.

Indians, whose country is the biggest importer, usually buy most of their gold ahead of religious festivals and the wedding season that follows the monsoon and the harvest. But Indian importers have been shy of the world market this year in anticipation that prices have further to fall. Chinese demand has also eased, by an estimated six percent in the third 1996 quarter, according to the World Gold Council. UBS's Smith predicted a volatile gold market. "Gold shares have been bubbling and currencies are so volatile that one day producers are buying and the next selling. On top of that we have had short covering in an oversold market," he said.

The other precious metals had mixed reactions. Silver followed gold higher before running into selling at $4.92 and settling around $4.89, up six cents.

Platinum slipped to a discount to gold at $372.00 down 55 cents. Dealers said a long position being unwound was pressuring platinum. Palladium was $0.25 cents lower at $116.00.
