HUNGRY US INVESTORS SEEN BUYING MORE EMERGING DEBT.

GENEVA 1996-12-05

U.S. mutual fund investors, who have responded to recent market rallies with fresh waves of cash, are expected to shop even more feverishly in emerging debt markets in 1997 than this year, the ANZ Bank said.

The bank's chief economist and head of financial market research, Jerome Booth, said U.S. and European investors were moving away from the low, stable yields of the developed world and hunting for better bargains in emerging market debt.

To respond to higher demand, ANZ, a big trader of Brady bonds and exotic debt with some 300 million under management, is planning to launch several new debt market funds next year, Booth told Reuters during a visit to Geneva.

"We are going to be launching a new fund every quarter next year. We hope to have one billion dollars under management by the end of 1997," he said.

"U.S. mutual fund investors are already in and they are increasing their allocations in emerging market debt. It's going to be huge," Booth said.

"Already there is an enormous amount of new money coming in. We've got an enormous search for higher yields now. I'm expecting enormous amounts of U.S. and European funds to come into emerging markets in 1997," he added.

International money managers told an investment conference in Geneva this week that global investors expected a boom in most emerging markets on higher domestic liquidity and growth as well as an inflow of U.S. and European funds.

Michael Howell, head of London's Crossborder Capital and a respected emerging market economist, said 50 billion of global money flew into emerging markets in 1996 -- up from 15 billion in 1995, 40 billion in 1994 and compared to 1993's peak of 63 billion -- and expected similar fund flows in 1997.
