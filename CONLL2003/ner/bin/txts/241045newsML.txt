GREEK FARMERS DEFY PM PLEA, ERECT MORE BARRICADES.

Greek farmers, defying a plea by Prime Minister Costas Simitis to end their nine-day seizure of the country's road and rail network, vowed to erect more barricades on Friday to press demands for higher produce prices.

"The farmers' union unanimously decided to continue the protest. We will now organise our struggle on a nationwide level," Vangelis Boutas, a farmers' representative, told reporters.

The farmers have blocked some 50 main junctions around Greece with a fleet of 10,000 tractors. Simitis's televised appeal on Thursday did little to defuse the crisis.

"The taking over of national roads and paralysing transport are putting an unbearable cost on the economy," said Simitis in his first public comments since the farmers began their revolt.

"They violate the rights of our citizens, and endanger the labour and income of other workers. I appeal to those who have taken over the road network to free it at once."

Since his 1997 austerity budget last week, Simitis has faced a wave of unrest from teachers, pensioners, students and dock workers. Athens streets echo almost daily with the chants of various groups protesting against his economic policies.

Simitis, who won elections in September, has said that sacrifices must be made by everyone to meet economic convergence targets with European Union partners and that failure to do so would be a disaster for Greece.

He said the farmers' demands would cost billions of dollars and the government had "nothing more to give".

The farmers want better price supports, cheaper fuel, the rescheduling of $1.3 billion in debts and lower Value Added Tax (VAT) on farming equipment.

Simitis gave no hint of what he would, or could, do to force the defiant farmers off the roads.

International and domestic land transport has ground to a halt and queues of stalled lorries stretch along motorways with irate drivers complaining about food, water and sanitation.

"Truck drivers have been stranded for days with no food. Tonnes of sensitive products like milk and meat have been ruined. We appeal to both the farmers and the government to reach a compromise," said Nikos Daditsas, a Greek truck drivers union leader.

Similar appeals were made by various other groups like the Greek Industries Association, the Northern Greek Exporters Union and the Greek Railways Organisation.

Opposition parties blasted the government for failing to find a solution and accused Simitis of making false promises to the farmers before the September elections.

The farmers have shut the borders with Bulgaria and Turkey, cut land links between Athens and the second city of Salonika in the north and surrounded Salonika airport, forcing passengers to walk to the terminal.
