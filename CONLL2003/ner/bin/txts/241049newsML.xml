<p>Shares in the Dutch-Anglo publishing giant, Reed Elsevier, have slumped five per cent, its largest one-day fall in years, as the market took fright at a company trading statement that some analysts saw as a profits warning.

<p>-- GEORGE EASES PRESSURE FOR EARLY RISE IN INTEREST RATES</p>
<p>Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, in a testimony to the Commons Treasury Select Committee, has said that he sees no urgent need for a dramatic rise in interest rates. He has suggested that he would like to see higher rates before the election. His comments were less severe on the need for tighter money that many pessimists in the City expected. Mr George also said that the Budget had not changed the views of the Bank that rates would have to rise if the Government is to hit its inflation target.</p>
<p>-- BIG PAYOUT CUT FEARED AFTER GAS DEMERGER</p>
<p>The demerger of British Gas into two separate trading and pipeline companies has been met with fears of a big cut in dividend by the City. Concerns emerged after the utility revealed details for the structure of the two new companies and announced it has agreed with British Petroleum the first renegotiation of take-or-pay gas contracts. Shares in British Gas surged with the news that it had secured a breakthrough in reducing its two to three billion stg liability on high-priced gas contracts.</p>
<p>-- GRANDMET PLANS SHARE BUYBACK</p>
<p>The food and drinks company, Grand Metropolitan, is to seek shareholder permission to launch a share buyback.

GrandMet hopes to buy back ten per cent of the company's share capital, worth 950 million stg. The company emphasises that it is unlikely to make such a large repurchase.</p>

<p>-- OFWAT APPLIES PLUNGER AS WATER COMPLAINTS GUSH</p>
<p>Ofwat, the water industry regulator, has published figures showing a doubling of interruptions to water supply, an increase in complaints from customers and wide regional variations in performance. This comes after independent research shows that average bills have risen by 42 per cent in the seven years since water companies were privatised. Director general of Ofwat, Ian Byatt, said not all companies had improved their services, leading to a slower overall improvement than in previous years.</p>
<p>-- FINANCIAL SERVICES NEEDS OVERHAUL</p>
<p>Colette Bowe, a senior financial regulator has admitted that a sweeping overhaul of regulation in the financial services industry is need to restore confidence among private investors. Ms Bowe, chief executive of the Personal Investment Authority, said that self-regulation no longer delivered the level of protection expected by investors. She advocated the creation of a designated agency that would be accountable to Parliament.</p>
<p>-- PACIFIC ISLAND TWO WALK FREE</p>
<p>Scotland Yard has freed two people arrested in connection with a 100 million dollar attempt to bankrupt the Pacific state of Vanuatu because the Crown would have had difficulties in mounting a prosecution in this country. Last week Britain returned the ten &quot;promissory notes&quot; to Vanuatu, thus removing the threat of bankruptcy. If they had been traded on the international markets they would have crippled the tiny state.</p>
