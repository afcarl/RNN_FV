-- STERLING FALLS AS PROSPECT OF EARLY RATE RISE DECLINES

The Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, has dampened speculation of a sharp rise in interest rates. The pound fell further following the statement, the third consecutive day sterling has fallen. George was speaking at the Treasury Select Committee, where he said there was no urgent need for a dramatic step on interest rates. However he did not rule out interest rate rises before the general election. The pound lost 3.1 pfennigs against the D-Mark and 1.1 cents against the US dollar.

-- BRITISH GAS AND BP END NORTH SEA ROW

In a first step towards stopping a serious row in the North Sea, British Gas has announced a 250 million stg deal with British Petroleum. At stake is the future of tens of billions of pounds of take or pay' contracts under which British Gas must pay for gas regardless of quantity of use. British Gas also announced plans of a demerger which will lead to a creation of listed company, Centrica, covering the domestic gas supply, trading, service and retail divisions.

-- EU ACTS ON MINIMUM ENERGY TAX RATES

The European Commission is understood to be drafting proposals for a substitute measure for its ill-fated carbon tax. Under the draft directive, minimum tax rates would be extended to all forms of energy in the European Union, including measures dealing with aviation fuel. The plans, which are likely to be submitted to EU governments early next year, are intended to further harmonise taxes as European energy markets are liberalised, and to aid the environment.

-- COURT BACKS CHEAP DRUG IMPORTS

The European Court has surprisingly sided with two British pharmaceutical importers over the issue of cheap unpatented drugs entering European Union countries via Spain and Portugal. The ruling is a blow for the pharmaceutical industry, which had complained that price controls and the absence of patents in Spain and Portugal made drugs cheaper there, and that allowing those drugs to be imported to other EU countries would cancel out the benefit of patent protections.

-- REGISTRATION OF NEW CARS FALLS

Figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show that registrations of new cars in November fell by 5.4 per cent compared to the same month last year. The figures were described as 'disappointing' by SMMT chief executive Ernie Thompson, coming as they do after the 13.3 per cent rise in October. Imports rose to account for 60.5 per cent of the market, compared to 53.8 per cent last year.

-- NHS CHIEFS 'WASTED MILLIONS' ON IT SCHEME

The cross-party Commons public account committee has fiercely criticised senior NHS managers over the mishandling of a 100 million sterling computerization pilot project. The committee was considering the Hospital Information Support Systems initiative, which it compared to the disastrous Wessex Regional Health Authority project in the late 1980s. The committee's report accused the NHS executive of wasting millions of pounds on the scheme and of failing to learn from past mistakes.

-- SPIRITS STRENGTHEN GRANDMET PROFITS

UK drinks and food group Grand Metropolitan has reported pre-tax profits of 965 million stg for the year to September, an increase of 5.8 per cent compared to the same period last time and one of the food and drink sector's best profit increases for years. The results, buoyed by higher prices and volumes, have given analysts hope that other companies in the sector will see similar improvements.

-- REED ELSEVIER SHARE FALL 5 PER CENT AFTER WARNING

Shares in the Anglo-Dutch publishing and information group Reed Elsevier fell 5 per cent on Thursday following a warning from the group that the recent strength of sterling was hurting profits. The statement, and a trading update from Reed, prompted analysts to revise their profit estimates for this year by up to 70 million stg.

-- GM SEEKS QUICK SALE FOR MISSILE MANUFACTURER

General Motors is offering for sale the defence and aerospace division of its Hughes Electric subsidiary. The offer follows the breakdown of merger talks between Hughes and aerospace rival Raytheon. The defence and aerospace division specialises in missiles, radar and military electronics, and GM hopes to see an auction completed by early 1997.

-- NIE'S 9 PER CENT RISE MEETS ESTIMATES

Regional electricity company Northern Ireland Electricity has reported a 9 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to September, to 52 million stg. The figures were in line with analysts' expectations. NIE is currently under investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission after the company failed to reach agreement with Northern Ireland's electricity regulator Ofreg over a new price control scheme.
