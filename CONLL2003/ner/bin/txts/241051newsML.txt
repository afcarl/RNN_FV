Big babies risk breast cancer later, study finds.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Women who were small babies have about half the risk of breast cancer as those who were big at birth, U.S. researchers reported on Friday. The research adds to growing evidence that birthweight can act as a pointer to a person's health in adulthood.

Karin Michels and colleagues at the Harvard School of Public Health found that girl babies weighing 2,000 grams (5.5 lbs) or less at birth grew up to have half the risk of breast cancer as girls weighing 4,000 grams (8.8 pounds) or more.

"Our study shows a significant relationship between birth weight and future breast cancer risk," said Michels. "But this should not lead women to strive for lower birthweight while pregnant." Michels' group studied more than 2,100 women taking part in a wider health survey. They had suspected there might be a link between birthweight and breast cancer, based on earlier studies.

They said the mother's hormones might be involved. Undeveloped breast cells could be more susceptible to surges of oestrogen during pregnancy, they said. The growth of a foetus is known to be affected by high oestrogen levels.

Other pregnancy hormones could also be involved.

"The findings support the hypothesis that breast cancer may originate in utero (in the womb), an hypothesis put forward in previous work by one of the co-authors, Dimitrios Trichopoulos," the Harvard School of Public Health said in a statement.

It was not the absolute size of the baby that mattered, the researchers said. "Although babies who are born prematurely are more likely to have a lower birthweight than those born at term, prematurity itself was not found to be associated with risk of breast cancer."

The hypothesis could be checked on several fronts, they suggested.

"The difference in birthweight between American and Asian women, and the difference in risk of breast cancer between these populations provide ecological support for our findings."

Many factors affects breast cancer. There is a strong genetic link, and a woman's age at menstruation and the timing of any pregnancies are known to play a role.

And the studies on birthweight and disease can be conflicting and confusing. It is not necessarily better to have either bigger or smaller babies.

High birthweight has been linked with a higher risk of prostate cancer and several studies have found a variety of associations between birthweight and several types of cancer.

Researchers, notably at Britain's Southampton University, have found that babies who weighed less at birth had a higher risk of heart disease as adults.
