<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures eased early on Friday in profit-taking after the week's large gains, brokers said.</p>
<p>January Brent fell 28 cents to $24.35 per barrel by 1106 GMT after Thursday's 60-cent rally. The Jan/Feb spread slipped by 10 cents to 75 cents backwardation.</p>
<p>&quot;It's typical end-of-week profit-taking,&quot; a broker said. &quot;There is no substantial change on the news front.&quot;</p>
<p>December gas oil was up $1 at $230.50 per tonne, catching up with Brent's late gains on Thursday, but volumes there were light.</p>
<p>&quot;Gas oil is just going along with the rest of the market,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>Dec/Jan gas oil opened at $2.00 backwardation, but was quickly sold down to $1.25.</p>
<p>One broker said traders were liquidating their positions ahead of the Dec expiry on Dec 12, and thought prices could fall further given the continuing large open interest in that contract.</p>
<p>Underlying support for products came from a strike at Elf's French refineries entering its ninth day. Unions were due to meet employers at 1300 GMT on Friday, but Elf was buying large amounts of gas oil and gasoline in the meantime, cash traders said.</p>
