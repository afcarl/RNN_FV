BSkyB shares hit, digital launch in doubt.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Shares in British satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting Group lost 2.3 percent of their value on Friday amid press speculation that plans to launch digital television next year could be delayed.

The shares were down 11-1/2p at 504p by 1001 GMT.

The Daily Telegraph said on Friday the manufacturers of the decoder boxes needed to receive digital channels have warned BSkyB that it must order the boxes within the next two weeks to guarantee the sets will be ready on time for next year's launch.

The UK newspaper said there are still a number of unresolved issues holding up the order.  

"I personally don't think things are as behind as they may appear to be," said Dennis Exton, analyst at Nikko.

"I still think they (BSkyB) are trying to move towards a service launch next year," he added. "But the trouble is the market is becoming more and more sceptical."

The FTSE 100 index was sharply lower on Friday, down 1.91 percent after an overnight sell-off in U.S. bonds and Far East markets.

"What you often get with market corrections is those stocks that are highly rated in price/earnings terms will overreact," Exton added, referring to BSkyB shares.
