<headline>FOCUS-European bourses tumble on Greenspan warning.</headline>

<p>European bourses fell sharply in early trade on Friday, badly shaken by anti-inflation remarks overnight from U.S. central bank chief Alan Greenspan.</p>
<p>Stocks and bonds in London, Paris and Frankfurt tumbled and the dollar weakened as Greenspan pulled the rug from under markets by suggesting that their current levels might be overdone.&quot;</p>
<p>The big gainer from the remarks of the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman was gold which rallied sharply as investors rushed to get out of equities into the safe haven of gold, analysts said.</p>
<p>What really frightened stock markets was Greenspan's view expressed, in a speech on Thursday, that the central bank had to be wary of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infecting stock and other asset markets.</p>
<p>Alarm bells rang quickly around the world, beginning in Tokyo where stocks plunged nearly 700 points, over three percent, in frantic trade on Friday, their biggest fall in a year and a half.</p>
<p>Fears of a possible Wall Street dive later on Friday provoked panic sales in Asia, sending indices into a tailspin and badly hitting the dollar, which showed losses against the mark and yen in early European trade.</p>
<p>European trading screens then lit up to show a big selloff in the first minutes of trade, with London plunging 1.7 percent and Frankfurt, which closed at a record peak on Thursday, down nearly three percent.</p>
<p>&quot;If it weren't for Greenspan's comments, I would have thought (UK shares) had the scope to go higher,&quot; said a dealer in London.</p>
<p>He said that while U.S. inflation had been low recently, its future course was uncertain and the Federal Reserve had to be forward-looking, taking action before dangers developed.</p>
<p>German shares plummetted 2.9 percent only a day after closing at a record of 2,909.91 on the DAX index. But some dealers thought the underlying tone of the market was strong.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we should be overly worried about these comments. I'm still not negative on the market,&quot; said one trader. &quot;But there will be a bit of uncertaintly until the U.S. figures this afternoon.&quot;</p>
<p>European bourses will be watching the data on U.S. November payrolls and unemployment due at 1330 GMT for clue on the state of the  American economy.</p>
<p>Greenspan's comments were also a catalyst for huge profit-taking in Paris where the bourse fell by 2.4 percent.</p>
<p>European debt markets were not spared. March German Bund futures on LIFFE were down 41 basis points at 100.29 after crumpling to a low of 99.87 at the open. March gilt futures slid 25/32 to 108-31 while March Italian bond futures dropped 93 basis points to 127.68.</p>
<p>&quot;The sell-off is all on the back of Greenspan's comments,&quot; said Jonathan York, a futures broker at Cater Allen here.</p>
<p>On bullion markets, however, gold prices rallied sharply in early European trading. Gold was trading around the $374 an ounce level, well up on Thursday's London close of $370.</p>
<p>&quot;The remarks made by Greenspan could not have come at a better time for gold which was reeling under downside pressure,&quot; one trader commented.</p>
<p>Earlier this week gold tumbled to a three-year low of around $366 under brisk speculative selling and talk of central bank selling.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 0945 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 112.10 yen and 1.5395 marks against 112.31 yen and 1.5490 marks in late Europe on Thursday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 0945 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was down 65.3 points at 3,985.9.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 share index was down 60.16 points at 2,232.4.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index down 81.79 points at 2,828.12.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was trading at $374 an ounce, compared with $370.00 at Thursday's close.</p>
