Haemocell future dependent on placing.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Haemocell Plc said on Friday that it will be unable to continue to trade unless it can implement a placing and open offer to raise around two million stg.

The placing and open offer is for 73.54 million new ordinary shares at three pence per share on the basis of 13 new ordinary shares for every five existing ordinary shares.

"In the event that the placing and open offer is not implemented, the group will be unable to continue to trade," said Haemocell in a statement.

By 0903 GMT, shares in Haemocell had lost 5p to stand at 4p.  

It said the proceeds will be used to repay debt and enable it to develop its marketing resources and provide the company wit  the resources to distribute a broader range of products.

Haemocell said that since January it has actively sought a strategic merger but after discussions with a number of prospective partners it said it failed to identify any such mergers that it thought would be in the best interest of its shareholders.

The business was formed in 1988 to exploit the autologous blood transfusion market. Haemocell's business has been largely based on a single product, System 350.

The company said that it will apply to the London Stock Exchange for the new ordinary shares and the existing ordinary shares to be admitted to the Alternative Investment Market.

The placing and open offer has been fully underwritten by Collins Stewart at the issue price.

Haemocell also announced that it made a loss before tax of 1.23 million stg for the year ended August 31, 1996 compared with a loss of 2.52 million previously.
