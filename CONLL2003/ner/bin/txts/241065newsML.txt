OPEC crude output rises to 26.14 mbpd in Nov - IEA.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Oil production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose by 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 26.14 million bpd in November from October's upwardly revised level, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its monthly report published on Friday.

The Paris-based energy watchdog said Saudi Arabia and Iran combined production increase by 170,000 bpd in November after both countries had lowered output in October.

This rise was only partly offset by maintenance related declines in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.

Following 50,000 bpd fall in October, Saudi Arabian output rose 100,000 bpd to 8.0 million bpd in November, said the IEA. Iranian output rose 65,000 bpd to 3.72 million bpd following falls of 15,000 bpd in October and 80,000 bpd in September.

Production also rose in Kuwait and the Neutral zone in November by 20,000 bpd and 12,000 bpd respectively.

All of the Neutral zone increases occurred onshore and are expected to rise again in December as new wells on shallow Ecocene deposits are brought onstream.

Libya is believed to have increased by 10,000 bpd to 1.4 million bpd and Algeria by 5,000 bpd to 845,000 bpd.

Maintenance related productions falls in the UAE's Murban field and Qatar's Maydan-Mahzam Bul Haninie fields reduced output in those two countries by 42,000 bpd to 2.19 million bpd and by 15,000 bpd to 490,000 bpd respectively.

Indonesian output fell back to 1.39 million bpd after rising to 1.42 million in bpd in October.

Nigeria slipped 10,000 bpd lower due to reduced production from the bonny and Escravos fields and smaller than expected gains from new offshore fields.

OPEC production of natural gas liquids, which are excluded from OPEC's quota system, rose by 60,000 bpd to 2.74 million bpd. But 45,000 bpd of that increase was due to the return of the Nigerian Oso condensate field after maintenance in October, the IEA said.  

The following are production levels for November with October production in brackets. Neutral Zone output of 0.52 million bpd is shared 50 percent each by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
