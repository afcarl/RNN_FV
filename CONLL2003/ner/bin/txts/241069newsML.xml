<p>Surging oil consumption in leading industrial nations will boost world oil demand this winter but rising output from non-OPEC suppliers should help quench their thirst, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday.</p>
<p>Global demand will rise to 73.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in the fourth quarter of 1996, a 100,000 bpd upward revision and up two million from the same period last year, the Paris-based agency said in its monthly oil market report.</p>
<p>Stronger than expected OECD demand in October, particularly for heating oil in the United States and Japan, was responsible for the upward adjustment, the IEA said.</p>
<p>&quot;In October, U.S. oil demand increased by 1.0 million bpd or 5.7 percent from a year earlier, mainly due to gas oil and other product deliveries...In Japan, oil demand rose by 7.7 percent due to the effect of cold weather,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The IEA left its forecast for world oil demand in 1997 unchanged at 73.7 million bpd, up 1.9 million on 1996.</p>
<p>Rising winter demand will increase the call on OPEC crude supplies plus stocks by 200,000 bpd to 26.2 million bpd in the fourth quarter of 1996 but strong non-OPEC supply growth will leave less room for the cartel next year, the agency said, making minor adjustments to last month's report.</p>
<p>It revised down its 1997 call on OPEC by 100,000 bpd to 25.2 million.</p>
<p>Non-OPEC producers are already grabbing the lion's share of the rise in demand, the IEA's end-November report showed.</p>
<p>A surge in non-OPEC output lifted world oil supply by 1.3 million bpd to 73.9 million in November versus a revised 72.6 million in October.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost 95 percent of the monthly increase occurred in non-OPEC production with the North Sea and Latin America accounting for about three-quarters of this... increase,&quot; the agency said.  </p>
<p>Absence of maintenance and increasing production from new fields is estimated to have boosted production in Norway and Britain by 372,000 bpd and 337,000 bpd respectively last month.</p>
<p>&quot;Brazilian offshore production and the recovery of Mexican crude and NGL production following the Cactus gas processing plant explosion this summer were responsible for most of the 150,000 bpd monthly increase in Latin American production,&quot; the IEA added.</p>
<p>The agency estimated November OPEC crude oil production at 26.14 million bpd versus October's 26.07 million, due to a combined 170,000 bpd increase in output from the cartel's leading members Saudi Arabia and Iran.</p>
