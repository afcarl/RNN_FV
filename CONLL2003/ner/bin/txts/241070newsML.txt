Cook says Triplex bid ignores value.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Takeover target William Cook Plc, a manufacturer of steel castings, sought to fight off an unsolicited bid from engineering group Triplex Lloyd Plc with a statement on Friday promising a substantial profit rise.

"Triplex Lloyd's bid represents only 10.8 times pro forma historic earnings, compared to an average market multiple of 16 times, and takes no account of this year's substantial improvement in profits", Cook said in its defence document.

"During the course of this bid, we shall publish a full profit forecast for the current year which will show a substantial improvement on last year," the company added.  

Cook told Reuters by telephone that the forecast, which would be published before December 30, would show "a significant improvement on both last year's (earnings) and on brokers' expectations".

"It will more than substantiate the words that I say in my letter to shareholders," he added.

Cook said that the company was keen to emphasise to investors that the uplift in profits was happening as a result of the first three years of a four-year investment programme which has virtually renewed all its component-making factories.

"We have rode out the stronger pound, and we've rode out a short-term order shortfall," he said.

Cook said that, although he felt the 17 million stg-plus investment programme had clearly improved shareholder value in the long term, he had not spelled out its impact on pretax profits, which have borne some 6.5 million stg of the cost.

"I've not made a very good job of explaining it to the market -- I didn't forsee a hostile bid," he added.

But, as far as underlying value was concerned, he said William Cook was worth double the value of Triplex Lloyd's cash and shares bid which values Cook at about 309 pence per share.
