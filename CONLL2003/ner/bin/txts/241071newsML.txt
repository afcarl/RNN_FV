OECD industry oil stocks rose 0.3 mbpd in Oct - IEA.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Industry-held oil inventories in OECD member nations rose 0.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in October compared to a 0.2 million bpd decrease in October 1995, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday.

In its end-November Monthly Oil Market Report, the Paris-based IEA said OECD members had narrowed the stock deficit compared to 1995 levels from 83 million at the end of September to 67 million barrels at the end of October.

The year-on-year shortfall was equivalent to two days of forward demand with 42 million barrels of this shortfall in Atlantic Basin distillate stocks. European stocks alone were 12 percent below 1995 levels.

In contrast, crude stocks were above or close to previous year levels in all three OECD regions, the IEA said.

But early indications for November shows pre-winter buying resulted in an "unusually large" decline of 1.1 million bpd in U.S. total oil stocks during the first three weeks of the month.

The IEA, which draws its membership from the OECD nations, said crude oil stocks rose by 0.7 million bpd on October "with significant increases" in the Pacific and North America.

Although middle distillate stocks rose 0.2 million bpd in OECD Europe, there was no change from the month earlier in OECD Pacific and North America.

Gasoline stocks in October fell 0.3 million bpd with North America seeing its inventories shrink by 0.2 million bpd and Europe by 0.1 million while Pacific gasoline stocks were unchanged.
