BTR shares hit yr low after trading update.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Shares in Anglo-Australian diversified manufacturer BTR Plc touched their lowest levels for a year on Friday despite a trading update which said second half performance should improve.

The shares were 4p lower at 226-1/2p by 0834 GMT after slipping to 223p in pre-market trade, the lowest level for a year.

But traders said the shares were showing strength against an overall weaker market. The FTSE 100 index fell sharply on Friday to open 58 points lower amid worries over U.S. interest rates.  

BTR said in a statement that second half profits would improve despite taking into account pressure from the strong pound.

The company said it had so far disposed of businesses representing 1.6 billion stg of turnover, against a target of 2.3 billion stg by the end of 1997.
