Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan pulled the rug out from under the dollar overnight by suggesting that the Fed feels the current levels of U.S. asset markets to be overdone, dealers said.

"What spooked the markets is the suggestion that the Fed, themselves, might perceive an "irrational exuberance' to be present in financial markets," said Paul Meggyesi, senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.

The long-bond sold off and with Wall Street looking vulnerable, the U.S. opening will be anxiously awaited.  

At 0830 GMT the dollar was at 1.5371/81 marks compared with around 1.5540 when Greenspan's comments were published. It closed on Thursday in Europe at 1.5515/22. Dollar/yen was also a little lower at 111.80/85 versus a previous 112.35/45.

Greenspan stopped short of commenting directly about the strong Wall Street performance, but said the Fed should consider stock and asset price shifts in setting policy and while inflation had been low recently its future course was uncertain.

Stock and bond markets in the Far-east and Europe took a pounding, with a dive in Globex S&P 500 stock futures pointing to a steep early fall on Wall Street this afternoon.  

"What is happening to the currency is a spin-off from what we are seeing in stocks and bonds," said Tim Fox, treasury economist at Standard Chartered.

"Clearly Wall Street is going have a big impact. If you are a foreigner exposed to U.S. stock and bond markets this will only hasten any thoughts you might have about moving towards hedging that exposure," he added.

The other potential trip-wire for the dollar today is the U.S. employment data. Any firmness there in the wake of Greenspan's somewhat hawkish inflation comments will only serve to convince traders that a monetary tightening is in the offing.  

Payrolls in November are expected to show a rise in the region of 180,000 after a 210,000 increase in October, with the overall jobless rate seen steady at 5.2 percent of the workforce. The data are due at 1330 GMT.

Traders said it is a little ominous that Greenspan's comments came before important jobs data and anything on the high side of expectations can only lead to stock and bond market losses. The dollar would also be a casualty.

With the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting just around the corner -- on December 17 -- the time is ripe for asset markets to get extremely nervous about a rate hike.  

Analysts said as the U.S. relies on net imports of capital, in order to fund the trade deficit, any volatility in assest markets will be bad news for the dollar.

"Anything which inhibits the smooth transfer of funds is a cause of concern for the currency," Deutsche's Meggyesi said.

Elsewhere, the mark was firmer on the crosses with the lira the hardest hit, although there were no major moves.

The lira slipped to 991.00 per mark, beneath the central parity of 990.00 at which it re-entered the European exchange rate mechanism on November 25.
