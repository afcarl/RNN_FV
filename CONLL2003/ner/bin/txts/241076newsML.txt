Chrysalis says start-up losses to continue.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Media company Chrysalis Group Plc said on Friday that start-up losses from its radio stations and record label would again hit its results this year.

"The board remains committed to the ongoing programme of investment in the group's new and developing business, where start-up losses from the radio stations and the Echo record label will continue to impact on the group's overall financial performance for the current year," it said in a statement.

Chrysalis reported a pre-tax loss of 5.36 million stg in the year to August 31.  

Chrysalis said the losses reflected start-up costs and development losses totalling some 6.7 million stg, split evenly between the commercial radio stations and the infant Echo record label. Losses and closure costs of the discontinued feature film business totalled a further 1.9 million stg.

Film producer David Puttnam resigned as a non-executive director of the company following the closure of the business.

Chrysalis said group operating loss was reduced by 46 percent to 5.8 million stg while its turnover rose 27 percent to 111.4 million. The dividend was maintained at 2.75 pence.  

"During the past year, our established music publishing and export businesses have shown extensive growth, our television production companies have moved substantially into profit and all three radio stations have exceeded expectations with each gaining significant audience shares," said chairman Chris Wright.

Wright said the agreement with Dutch publisher VNU to launch a joint venture European TV production company was "a superb platform on which to build our further expansion into Europe's rapidly growing television market".  

He added that chart success for Echo's Babybird band and the success of a consortium involving Chrysalis in securing the contract to supply ITV's Formula One coverage were evidence of an excellent start to the current year.
