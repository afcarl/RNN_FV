UK's Rifkind denies Clarke threatened to resign.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind on Friday dismissed reports Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke threatened to quit over the government's European policy.

"Allegations were made, Ken Clarke has denied them, that's good enough for me, it should be good enough for you," Rifkind told a radio interviewer on Friday.

Clarke on Friday denied reports he had threatened to resign if Major had decided to rule out entry into a single European currency in the life of the next parliament. The government's current policy is to wait and decide on entry at the time. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7768
