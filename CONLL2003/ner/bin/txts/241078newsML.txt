GEC marked lower after restructuring charge.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Shares in British defence electronics giant General Electric Company Plc were marked lower on Friday after the company reported first half pretax profits of 421 million stg but charged 160 million stg for restructuring.

GEC shares were 5p lower at 360-1/2p in pre-market trading.  

"All in all, the GEC results are a bit disappointing," one analyst who declined to be named said. "The headline profits figure was just in line, the dividend increase wasn't very generous and the exceptional was unexpected."

GEC raised its interim dividend to 3.26p per share from 3.10 last year.

Analysts said the GEC statement revealed no great strategic insights but said its new chief executive George Simpson may give more details of his vision for the company when he meets analysts later on Friday.

After the market opening GEC were quoted 7.0p down at 358.5 -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717.
