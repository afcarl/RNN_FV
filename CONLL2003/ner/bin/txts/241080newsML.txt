LONDON 1996-12-06

GEC Plc, the British defence to industrial giant, saw half-year pretax profits slip sharply to 261 million pounds from 402 million on Friday, hit by a charge of 160 million as the group prepares for a string of disposals.

In the first set of results delivered since George Simpson took over as head of the group from veteran managing director Lord Weinstock, GEC said the charge was being levied "for the restructuring of existing and acquired businesses" as well as marking down assets in its industrial group before sale.  

Commenting on its disposal plans, GEC said the industrial division was "in the course of negotiation" on further disposals adding that "other businesses are being restructured to improve shareholder returns".

Looking at the results, underlying profit growth was once again slight, rising 4.7 percent to 421 million, with the dividend payout at 3.26 pence versus 3.10 pence per share.

GEC's net cash pile dipped to 1.048 billion pounds ($1.70 billion) from 1.203 billion, excluding money in joint ventures.

Electronic systems and defence reported progress, with margins and profits ahead, said chairman Lord Prior. "GEC Alsthom maintained sales and profits in line with expectations. Telecommunications, consumer goods, office equipment and printing, medical equipment, industrial apparatus and distribution and trading all contributed higher profits."
