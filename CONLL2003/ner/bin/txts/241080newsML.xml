<p>GEC Plc, the British defence to industrial giant, saw half-year pretax profits slip sharply to 261 million pounds from 402 million on Friday, hit by a charge of 160 million as the group prepares for a string of disposals.</p>
<p>In the first set of results delivered since George Simpson took over as head of the group from veteran managing director Lord Weinstock, GEC said the charge was being levied &quot;for the restructuring of existing and acquired businesses&quot; as well as marking down assets in its industrial group before sale.  </p>
<p>Commenting on its disposal plans, GEC said the industrial division was &quot;in the course of negotiation&quot; on further disposals adding that &quot;other businesses are being restructured to improve shareholder returns&quot;.</p>
<p>Looking at the results, underlying profit growth was once again slight, rising 4.7 percent to 421 million, with the dividend payout at 3.26 pence versus 3.10 pence per share.</p>
<p>GEC's net cash pile dipped to 1.048 billion pounds ($1.70 billion) from 1.203 billion, excluding money in joint ventures.</p>
<p>Electronic systems and defence reported progress, with margins and profits ahead, said chairman Lord Prior. &quot;GEC Alsthom maintained sales and profits in line with expectations. Telecommunications, consumer goods, office equipment and printing, medical equipment, industrial apparatus and distribution and trading all contributed higher profits.&quot;</p>
