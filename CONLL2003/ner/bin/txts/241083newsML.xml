<p>Anglo-Australian diversified manufacturer BTR Plc said on Friday it expected its second half trading performance to show an improvement over the first half, after taking into account some pressure from a strong pound.</p>
<p>In a trading update the company said that it had so far disposed of businesses representing 1.6 billion pounds ($2.60 billion) of turnover, against its target of 2.3 billion pounds of sales by the end of 1997.  </p>
<p>BTR's new strategy was launched in September this year and seeks to generate profitable growth by concentrating on its top industrial manufacturing and engineering businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;Current exchange rates will have some adverse translation impact on the second half of 1996. However, in overall terms performance of the continuing businesses is expected to show some improvement in the second half of 1996 over the first half,&quot; the company said in its statement.</p>
<p>On the currency stuation BTR added, &quot;the recent strengthening of sterling is expected to result in the value of (the currency) benefit for the whole of the year being somewhat less that that recorded in the first half&quot;.</p>
<p>Of a restructuring provision announced in September, the company now expects to use about 100 million pounds in 1996 and actions already taken include reorganising several German industrial units and glass pacckaging operations in Australia.</p>
