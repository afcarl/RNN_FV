Wolv & Dudley says consumer spend improving.

LONDON 1996-12-06

David Miller, chairman of brewer Wolverhampton & Dudley said on Friday consumer spending is generally improving with drinkers stepping up to premium lagers and food-led pubs.

"Consumer expenditure is generally improving, with trading up ...helping both sales and gross margins. Notwithstanding regulatory uncertainty, we expect to make good progress in 1997," said Miller in a statement.

Earlier, the company reported a seven percent increase in pretax profits to 43 million stg for the year ended September 29.  

Miller called on the European Commission to speed up its decision on whether to allow brewers to keep their pub tenants tied to beer supplies.

"Such uncertainty makes investment decisions very difficult, and is probably contributing to the overall under-performance of the tenancy sector within the brewing industry," said Miller.

"Further delay in the review, or increased regulation, will both diminish investment and erect new barriers to newcomers," he added.  

He also said the opposition Labour Party's proposed introduction of a national minimum wage would raise the company's costs.

"The level of this has not yet been determined but there are reports of a rate in excess of 4.00 stg an hour. This would undoubtedly raise our costs as we employ over 7,000 part-time pub serving staff," said Miller.

The company plans to build 16 new pubs and to continue with the refurbishment of 50 existing pubs in 1997. It will spend about 65 million in 1996/97 on improving its Banks's brewery in Wolverhampton and Camerons brewery in Hartlepool.  

Property profits in 1996 were 0.2 million compared with 3.3 million stg in 1995, the latter arising from the sale of its Crown and Raven hotels.

The company now operates 93 specialist pubs and pub restaurants, in seven different styles. In 1997 the company plans to develop a further 39 of these pubs.
