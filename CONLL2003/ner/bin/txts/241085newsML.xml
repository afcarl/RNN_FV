<p>David Miller, chairman of brewer Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley said on Friday consumer spending is generally improving with drinkers stepping up to premium lagers and food-led pubs.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumer expenditure is generally improving, with trading up ...helping both sales and gross margins. Notwithstanding regulatory uncertainty, we expect to make good progress in 1997,&quot; said Miller in a statement.</p>
<p>Earlier, the company reported a seven percent increase in pretax profits to 43 million stg for the year ended September 29.  </p>
<p>Miller called on the European Commission to speed up its decision on whether to allow brewers to keep their pub tenants tied to beer supplies.</p>
<p>&quot;Such uncertainty makes investment decisions very difficult, and is probably contributing to the overall under-performance of the tenancy sector within the brewing industry,&quot; said Miller.</p>
<p>&quot;Further delay in the review, or increased regulation, will both diminish investment and erect new barriers to newcomers,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>He also said the opposition Labour Party's proposed introduction of a national minimum wage would raise the company's costs.</p>
<p>&quot;The level of this has not yet been determined but there are reports of a rate in excess of 4.00 stg an hour. This would undoubtedly raise our costs as we employ over 7,000 part-time pub serving staff,&quot; said Miller.</p>
<p>The company plans to build 16 new pubs and to continue with the refurbishment of 50 existing pubs in 1997. It will spend about 65 million in 1996/97 on improving its Banks's brewery in Wolverhampton and Camerons brewery in Hartlepool.  </p>
<p>Property profits in 1996 were 0.2 million compared with 3.3 million stg in 1995, the latter arising from the sale of its Crown and Raven hotels.</p>
<p>The company now operates 93 specialist pubs and pub restaurants, in seven different styles. In 1997 the company plans to develop a further 39 of these pubs.</p>
