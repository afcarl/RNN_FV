<headline>British &quot;Euro-sceptic&quot; says Clarke should resign.</headline>

<p>A &quot;Euro-sceptic&quot; member of the ruling Conservative party said on Thursday British finance minister Kenneth Clarke had to resign to prevent the party disintegrating over the issue of a single European currency.</p>
<p>Member of Parliament Tony Marlow said the resignation of the chancellor of the exchequer was the only way to make the Conservatives electable in a general election which must take place by May next year.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a divided and split Cabinet. This cannot endure,&quot; Marlow told BBC television's Newsnight programme on Thursday. &quot;It is not sustainable. Kenneth Clarke has to go. If he doesn't resign, the prime minister has got to fire him.&quot;</p>
<p>Marlow's comment come on the heels of speculation that Clarke had threatened to resign if the government changed its &quot;wait and see&quot; policy on a single currency and declared it would not sign up for the currency in the next Parliament.</p>
<p>Clarke denied on Thursday he had threatened to resign and said his position on the single currency was in tune with that of Prime Minister John Major.</p>
<p>Major told parliament on Thursday he would keep his options open on single-currency membership. His statement was interpreted as a significant victory for Clarke and fellow pro-European Michael Heseltine, deputy prime minister.</p>
<p>Pro-European Conservative MP Edwina Currie told the BBC that if Clarke resigned, other ministers would go with him.</p>
