National Power faces pension bill - paper.

LONDON 1996-12-06

British electricity generator National Power Plc could have to repay more than 200 million pounds sterling it removed from its employees' pension scheme after a landmark ruling by the Pensions Ombudsmen, the Independent newspaper said on Friday.

The claim follows the provisional judgment by Dr. Julian Farrand, the ombudsman, in a case brought by two National Grid pensioners.

Farrand said National Grid, which operates Britain's high-voltage transmission system, misused pension fund surplus cash because the scheme's rules stated the surplus could not be paid to the employer.
