BSkyB digital launch in doubt - paper.

LONDON 1996-12-06

British satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc's plans to launch hundreds of digital pay-television channels next year could be delayed until 1998, the Daily Telegraph newspaper said on Friday.

Manufacturers of decoder boxes which are needed to receive the service have warned BSkyB that it must order the boxes within the next two weeks to guarantee that the sets will be ready for next year's planned launch, the Telegraph said.

A number of issues are believed to be holding up the order of hundreds of thousands of boxes, the paper said.

BSkyB is thought to be angry with the new regulations for digtal pay-television announced last week which it reckons will not enable it to earn a decent return on its investment, the Telegraph said.

There is also an unresolved debate about whether the boxes should include a module to make them compatible with terrestrial channels.

Some manufacturers reckon the extra module could add an extra 15 percent to the cost of the box, which they estimate at 300 stg, the Telegraph said.
