Eurotunnel says fire might have stopped train.

LONDON 1996-12-05

Intense heat from the fire on a Channel Tunnel freight train last month could have caused an electrical fault which stopped the train, a Eurotunnel spokesman said on Thursday.

After the blaze on November 18, which injured 34 people and severely damaged a section of the undersea passage, there was concern that the train had come to a halt in the tunnel despite drivers' instructions to keep moving in the event of fire.

Eurotunnel spokesman John Noulton responded to claims by an engineering expert that in the event of a fire, electricity could arc between overhead power lines and earthing cables.

"The temperature seems to have been high enough and there was dense smoke," Noulton told Britain's Channel Four television news. "All the ingredients for ionisation were there. It's possible."

One of Eurotunnel's safety procedures in the event of a blaze is that trains should continue through the tunnel and out into the open where passengers can be more easily evacuated and flames tackled more quickly.

But during the fire, the train came to a halt a third of the way into the 51-km (32-mile) northbound tunnel. Several passengers suffered from smoke inhalation.

Freight traffic resumed a few days after the fire but shuttles of the type on which the fire occured will only resume after a French investigation of the accident is over.
