<p>Intense heat from the fire on a Channel Tunnel freight train last month could have caused an electrical fault which stopped the train, a Eurotunnel spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>After the blaze on November 18, which injured 34 people and severely damaged a section of the undersea passage, there was concern that the train had come to a halt in the tunnel despite drivers' instructions to keep moving in the event of fire.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel spokesman John Noulton responded to claims by an engineering expert that in the event of a fire, electricity could arc between overhead power lines and earthing cables.</p>
<p>&quot;The temperature seems to have been high enough and there was dense smoke,&quot; Noulton told Britain's Channel Four television news. &quot;All the ingredients for ionisation were there. It's possible.&quot;</p>
<p>One of Eurotunnel's safety procedures in the event of a blaze is that trains should continue through the tunnel and out into the open where passengers can be more easily evacuated and flames tackled more quickly.</p>
<p>But during the fire, the train came to a halt a third of the way into the 51-km (32-mile) northbound tunnel. Several passengers suffered from smoke inhalation.</p>
<p>Freight traffic resumed a few days after the fire but shuttles of the type on which the fire occured will only resume after a French investigation of the accident is over.</p>
