<title>UK: Osteoporosis drug reduces fractures, study finds.</title>

<p>U.S. researchers published findings on Friday that the drug alendronate, marketed by U.S.-based Merck and Co Inc as Fosamax, can reduce the incidence of hip fractures by 51 percent among women with osteoporosis. Women with the debilitating, bone-thinning disease who took the drug also were 47 percent less likely to suffer spinal fractures, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The results are exciting and significant, because nearly all hip fractures require hospitalisations,&quot; said Dennis Black, an epidemiologist at the University of California at San Francisco who led the study.</p>
<p>&quot;Up to 20 percent of women who suffer hip fractures die within a year.&quot; Black said the results were so promising that the first part of the study was ended early so all the volunteers could take the drug.</p>
<p>The report, published in the Lancet medical journal, also said women on the drug lost less height over three years than women given a placebo. Loss of height as the bones become weaker is a common symptom of osteoporosis.</p>
<p>Alendronate inhibits bone resorption or breakdown.</p>
<p>This allows the body to increase bone mass, as the body normally both builds and resorbs bone matter at the same time.</p>
<p>Fosamax has been widely prescribed, primarily for postmenopausal women since it became available last year. It is estimated that between 500,000 and one million women worldwide now are taking the drug.</p>
<p>Black's group had first publicised their research at a medical meeting in Seattle in September.</p>
<p>They said there were a few drawbacks to their research -- 97 percent of the women taking part were Caucasian and all had suffered fractures before.</p>
<p>But a continuing study involves more than 4,000 women who had not suffered a fracture before.</p>
<p>Black said the drug was well-tolerated. But in October, a report in the New England Journal of Medicine said the drug could injure the oesophagus if not taken properly.</p>
<p>Osteoporosis, also known as brittle-bone disease, affects about 200 million women around the world. Often the first symptom is a broken hip.</p>
<p>It is more common in women, whites and older people.</p>
<p>Other therapies for osteoporosis include hormone replacement, as oestrogen is known to play a role in bone-building, and a new approach using protease inhibitors, which target a specific cell enzyme.</p>
<p>Doctors say osteoporosis can be prevented or eased with a diet that includes plenty of calcium, and bone-stressing exercise such as brisk walking, aerobics or weight-lifting.</p>
