More bad news on AIDS vaccine attempts.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Researchers seeking a vaccine against the HIV virus that causes AIDS reported more bad news on Friday -- the latest effort, like several before it, does not work.

But a fellow AIDS researcher said the failure did not mean they should give up. On the contrary, the failures were helping them home in on an approach that will work against the virus.

Joseph Eron and colleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill tested 550 people who were infected with HIV but had no symptoms.

Their vaccine was called MNrgp120, after the part of the virus's outer envelope it targeted, they reported in the Lancet medical journal.

But they stopped the trial after 15 months when it became clear the vaccine was not working.

Other vaccines have shown similar poor results, but experts know that HIV is one of the trickiest viruses ever seen -- mutating quickly and efficiently and turning the body's own immune system against itself.

All vaccines work to stimulate the body's immune system to fight off the invader -- be it a virus or a bacterium. Different AIDS vaccines have hoped to use slightly different parts of the virus to stimulate this effect so that patients never progress to full-blown AIDS.

Dr Barton Haynes of the Duke University Centre for AIDS Research said the findings should not necessarily be regarded as negative because "it shows the field can now move on to other strategies."

"First, it is now clear that the destruction of the immune system by HIV is due to relentless and high levels of HIV replication," he wrote.

It was also clear that an infected person's immune system was already working overtime against the virus, to no ultimate effect, so the idea of further stimulating the immune system was probably out.

He said any vaccine would have to take into account the huge variability seen in HIV. The good news was that much was known about how the virus works on a biochemical, cellular level -- so researchers know what bits to target.

Researchers could also learn from people known to have genetic resistance to HIV, he said.
