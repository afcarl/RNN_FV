Doctors fear bug that feeds on antibiotics.

British doctors said on Friday they feared they had seen a true superbug -- a microbe thatthrived on the antibiotics meant to kill it.

The doctors said they had managed to kill off the infection, with difficulty, but were fascinated that the bacteria had managed to mutate to such an extent -- and so quickly.

"Have we at last witnessed the emergence of a true superbug?" they asked in a letter to the Lancet medical journal.

The cases showed a further step in evolution of a microbe -- from being affected by a drug to resisting it, and then to depending on the drug, said Ian Eltringham at the Department of Medical Microbiology at London's St George's Hospital.

"(The bacteria) could only survive if you gave it the antibiotic. The bug's poison became its food," he said.

Doctors have been warning that the widespread overuse of antibiotics was helping some micro-organisms evolve into strains that can resist all drugs. This mutation went further.

Eltringham and his colleagues described the cases of two men treated for infection after undergoing major surgery. They only began to recover when antibiotics, seen to be feeding the bacteria instead of killing it, were withdrawn.

The infections both involved Enterococcus faecium, a common gut bacteria that normally can be treated with the antibiotic vancomycin. At first vancomycin worked, but then the patients both got sick again.

Eltringham's group grew cultures of the bacteria and tested them against drugs. "We started to grow a strain of the same organism that became dependent on the antibiotic," he said.

They stopped giving the patients vancomycin and in one case removed all antibiotics. Both got better quickly.

Microbes such as bacteria, viruses and fungi have various means to become resistant to drugs. In this case, Eltringham said the enterococcus got its resistance from other bacteria.

"The resistance is carried on small bits of DNA called plasmids," he said. The microbes could exchange these. "Bug A meets bug B and then they are both resistant."

Some doctors fear bacteria will become resistant to all antibiotics, which could plunge humanity back into the days when people died in the millions of what are now considered minor infections.

But Eltringham said this was not a threat to the general public. "I think it's more of a novelty," he said.

He said doctors should be aware of new strains as the resistant strain was not obvious. "It's silent...It doesn't leave a signal anywhere."

Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are two of the most common such threats now.
