Union set to make concessions to Canadian Airlines.

Canadian Auto Workers President Buzz Hargrove said on Thursday that the union would accept a wage cut and other concessions in an effort to reach a negotiated settlement to save Canadian Airlines Corp.

Hargrove, in difficult talks on a plan to restructure Canada's second-largest airline, also revealed that his family had received a bomb threat as new talks got underway Thursday.

"We've moved and said now we'll accept pay cuts. I think we have moved considerably," Hargrove told a news conference. He said the fact that the talks were continuing ahead of a government-ordered vote was a small sign of hope.

"The fact we haven't hit a stone wall is in fact for me progress," Hargrove said.

Canadian Labour Minister Alfonso Gagliano on Wednesday invoked a little-used section in the Canadian Labour Code to force the vote, which has been adamantly opposed by Hargrove.

The vote could be held as early as Monday and Hargrove said he was still hoping a negotiated settlement could be reached before then.

He said if there was not a negotiated settlement the union would make a recommendation on how the members should vote in the government-backed ballot.

The union, which represents ticket agents, is the only one of six unions at the airline that has not accepted the restructuring plan. The airline is seeking wage cuts of C$35 million ($26 million) a year from Canadian's 16,400 employees, which it has called rucial to its survival.

A defiant Hargrove told a news conference earlier that he was certain the union's 3,700 members at Canadian would back whatever recommendation he made.

Canadian Airlines spokeswoman Claudia Cattaneo said she thought the vote could be held as early as Monday while CAW leaders said a vote would take at least a week to 10 days to complete.

The plan also includes federal and provincial government support and a C$48 million ($36 million) yearly cut in fees paid to the airline's 33 percent-owner AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines.

Canadian is also trying to postpone about C$170 million ($125 million) in debt payments over the next six months, a move contingent on the plan being in place.

Union member Victoria Gonzalez said she did not understand why 10 percent wage and 17.5 percent benefit concessions accepted by union members in a contract a year ago were not enough to keep the airline aloft.

"We have a union in place, so it's very undemocratic what the government is doing," Gonzalez said. "It's like something out of Central America."

Hargrove, whose union waged a 20-day strike at General Motors Corp. in Canada in October, accused Canadian Chief Executive Kevin Benson of manufacturing a crisis to force employees into wage cuts.

Industry analysts have said that Canadian's problems had more to do with capacity than wages.

"The big problem has been the fact that there's too much capacity domestically chasing far too few travelers," said Bunting Warburg analyst Ted Larkin.

Hargrove told reporters that his former wife and his family had received a bomb scare and other threats from people angry over the talks with Canadian.

Hargrove said someone published his ex-wife's telephone number on the Internet, which resulted in a slew of ugly phone calls overnight and during the day, including the bomb threat.

He said someone on Thursday slashed the tires of a car belonging to the family.

"It's really taken quite a toll on my ability to concentrate on this," said the 52-year-old Hargrove.

But Hargrove said he was not concerned about his own safety. "I'm at a stage in my life where nothing much scares me," he said.
