<p>Canadian Auto Workers President Buzz Hargrove said on Thursday that the union would accept a wage cut and other concessions in an effort to reach a negotiated settlement to save Canadian Airlines Corp.</p>
<p>Hargrove, in difficult talks on a plan to restructure Canada's second-largest airline, also revealed that his family had received a bomb threat as new talks got underway Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We've moved and said now we'll accept pay cuts. I think we have moved considerably,&quot; Hargrove told a news conference. He said the fact that the talks were continuing ahead of a government-ordered vote was a small sign of hope.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact we haven't hit a stone wall is in fact for me progress,&quot; Hargrove said.</p>
<p>Canadian Labour Minister Alfonso Gagliano on Wednesday invoked a little-used section in the Canadian Labour Code to force the vote, which has been adamantly opposed by Hargrove.</p>
<p>The vote could be held as early as Monday and Hargrove said he was still hoping a negotiated settlement could be reached before then.</p>
<p>He said if there was not a negotiated settlement the union would make a recommendation on how the members should vote in the government-backed ballot.</p>
<p>The union, which represents ticket agents, is the only one of six unions at the airline that has not accepted the restructuring plan. The airline is seeking wage cuts of C$35 million ($26 million) a year from Canadian's 16,400 employees, which it has called rucial to its survival.</p>
<p>A defiant Hargrove told a news conference earlier that he was certain the union's 3,700 members at Canadian would back whatever recommendation he made.</p>
<p>Canadian Airlines spokeswoman Claudia Cattaneo said she thought the vote could be held as early as Monday while CAW leaders said a vote would take at least a week to 10 days to complete.</p>
<p>The plan also includes federal and provincial government support and a C$48 million ($36 million) yearly cut in fees paid to the airline's 33 percent-owner AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines.</p>
<p>Canadian is also trying to postpone about C$170 million ($125 million) in debt payments over the next six months, a move contingent on the plan being in place.</p>
<p>Union member Victoria Gonzalez said she did not understand why 10 percent wage and 17.5 percent benefit concessions accepted by union members in a contract a year ago were not enough to keep the airline aloft.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a union in place, so it's very undemocratic what the government is doing,&quot; Gonzalez said. &quot;It's like something out of Central America.&quot;</p>
<p>Hargrove, whose union waged a 20-day strike at General Motors Corp. in Canada in October, accused Canadian Chief Executive Kevin Benson of manufacturing a crisis to force employees into wage cuts.</p>
<p>Industry analysts have said that Canadian's problems had more to do with capacity than wages.</p>
<p>&quot;The big problem has been the fact that there's too much capacity domestically chasing far too few travelers,&quot; said Bunting Warburg analyst Ted Larkin.</p>
<p>Hargrove told reporters that his former wife and his family had received a bomb scare and other threats from people angry over the talks with Canadian.</p>
<p>Hargrove said someone published his ex-wife's telephone number on the Internet, which resulted in a slew of ugly phone calls overnight and during the day, including the bomb threat.</p>
<p>He said someone on Thursday slashed the tires of a car belonging to the family.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really taken quite a toll on my ability to concentrate on this,&quot; said the 52-year-old Hargrove.</p>
<p>But Hargrove said he was not concerned about his own safety. &quot;I'm at a stage in my life where nothing much scares me,&quot; he said.</p>
