<p>Canada's health care system, often held up as a model of socialized medicine, is struggling to stay healthy as federal and provincial governments take their scalpels to bloated budget deficits.</p>
<p>Tales of filthy hospitals and patients stranded on gurneys in hallways or enduring long waits for tests, surgery or other treatment pepper the Canadian press.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the concern ... is that doctors feel our ability to access timely, quality health care for our patients is being impaired,&quot; said Judith Kazimirski, the new president of the Canadian Medical Association. &quot;We have had an excellent system. We deserve an excellent system and we really have to see this as a wake-up call for the people of Canada to get involved in the debate.&quot;</p>
<p>Payments to Canada's provinces by the federal government for health, welfare and post-secondary education have been slashed in the past decade and face a further $2.7 billion in cuts in the next two years under deficit-reduction plans.</p>
<p>The efforts have been lauded by the global financial community, but they are hurting the system.</p>
<p>LESS MONEY TO TREAT AGING BABY BOOMERS</p>
<p>Stress fractures are appearing in all branches of the health care network, with patients and doctors citing a litany of problems likely to intensify as aging baby boomers require more and more medical care. While Canada's health care is to some extent still buoyed by its earlier reputation, signs of malaise in the system are myriad, activists and doctors agree.</p>
<p>Physicians across the country are having trouble booking patients in hospitals or scheduling them for tests or surgery. Hospital nursing and support staff are stretched to the limit after a raft of layoffs. Emergency ward closures have created endless waits for vital care.</p>
<p>One recent study said cancer patients were experiencing dangerously long delays in getting crucial radiation treatment. According to Edmonton activist Phylis Matousek, patients are often left lying in hallways for hours because of a lack of beds and housekeeping staff. &quot;One woman we know was left on a gurney in a hallway for 38 hours,&quot; Matousek said.</p>
<p>Some have lain in their own bodily wastes for long stretches because of cuts in hospital support staff.</p>
<p>&quot;What I am hearing from my patients is that when they have their family admitted to hospital, especially elder family, they are staying there and doing many of the tasks themselves,&quot; Kazimirski said.</p>
<p>SOME DEFEND SYSTEM</p>
<p>&quot;The quality of the system is still very good,&quot; said Michelle Bagnali, director of policy and communications at the Canadian Healthcare Association, an Ottawa-based lobby group. But she said budget cuts have occurred without shifting funds to prevention and promotion, community and home care and primary care -- crucial areas where money needs to be redeployed to help individuals and the community take more responsibility for health.</p>
<p>Disaffected Ontario doctors this month refused to take any new patients to protest the province's proposed salary cuts and plans to force some doctors to relocate to rural areas. Pregnant women across the province talk of growing panic as they search for care.</p>
<p>There is little agreement on the cure for the debilitating disease affecting the health care system.</p>
<p>Some, including Alberta Premier Ralph Klein, believe the only way forward is to have a partly private system, but critics of such a two-tier solution are legion.</p>
<p>Other provinces, including Saskatchewan and Alberta, which both boast budget surpluses, recently have plowed funds back into health care after hacking them out over the past few years.</p>
<p>The government-sponsored National Forum on Health is working on a report due in January about the state of the system and recommendations to improve it.</p>
