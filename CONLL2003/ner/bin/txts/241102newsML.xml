<p>The new Chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, Gatjil Djerrkura, says he firmly believes in a consultative approach to achieving what's best for indigenous people.</p>
<p>The general manager of the Northern Territory's Yirrkala Business Enterprises has been appointed by Federal Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron to succeed Lois O'Donoghue as ATSIC chair.</p>
<p>Mr Djerrkura told ABC Radio he was looking forward to the challenge of the position, saying everyone has their successes, shortfalls and different tactics to achieve their objectives.</p>
<p>Northern Territory Aboriginal Development Minister Mick Palmer says the Territory Government is looking forward to working with Mr Djerrkura.</p>
<p>Mr Palmer says Mr Djerrkura is not only a traditional Aboriginal owner but an astute businessman who understands the need for economic development in Aboriginal communities.</p>

<p>ADELAIDE HOSTAGE DRAMA ENDS</p>
<p>The hostage incident at the Adelaide Remand Centre is over.</p>
<p>Police say a man aged 24 has given himself up, after releasing a younger man he'd held in a cell for two hours or more.</p>
<p>He was armed with a sharp instrument, and the hostage, aged 19, has been receiving treatment for what police call a slight nick.</p>
<p>Star force police with gas cannisters went into the remand centre during the incident, and all inmates were locked in their cells while negotiators spoke to the 24-year-old.</p>
<p>Police say CIB detectives will interview the man.</p>

<p>ANOTHER VERSION OF JUDGE INVESTIGATION</p>
<p>The Police Royal Commission is hearing another version of claims that Special Branch officers took charge of an investigation involving a retired judge.</p>
<p>A witness known as CC3 was a junior officer when called to a job at Sydney's Wynyard station in October 1988.</p>
<p>CC3 says he had never previously dealt with a judge or with Special Branch.</p>
<p>This particular job, he says, was memorable with retired judge David Yeldham accused of indecent behaviour, and with two Special Branch men in suits arriving and announcing they would take over the matter.</p>
<p>CC3 denies that he was told before seeing judge Yeldham that police were going to write the matter off.</p>

<p>ABORIGINAL BAN IN KALGOORLIE WOULDN'T WORK: MINISTER</p>
<p>West Australian Police Minister, Bob Wiese, has dimissed as headline-grabbing, an independent candidate's suggestion that Aboriginal people be banned from the city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder.</p>
<p>Darby Renton, who's standing for the seat of Kalgoorlie in the State election, says the ban would be similar to one enforced on Chinese and Afghan people at the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Mr Renton told a public meeting on crime the ban was aimed at people who did not abide by society's expectations.</p>
<p>But Mr Wiese told the meeting such ideas don't work in the real world, and a community approach was needed to law and order problems in the Goldfields city.</p>
<p>Mr Wiese says a mobile police station will be opened in Boulder during business hours and in Kalgoorlie's main street, Hannan Street, after hours.</p>

<p>NSW POLICE THREATEN SWITCH TO FEDERAL AWARDS</p>
<p>The New South Wales Police Association is seeking legal advice on whether its members can switch to Federal awards to restore their rights of appeal against dismissal.</p>
<p>Police want the right to appeal to the Industrial Relations Commission, overriding Police Commissioner Peter Ryan's powers to sack officers, with no right of appeal.</p>
<p>The Police Association has also advised its members to reject the State Government's offer of a three-per cent pay rise and hold out for an increase of around 30 per cent.</p>
<p>And it wants the Government to agree to pay out police who've served a minimum of 25 years.</p>

<p>FARMERS WELCOME TELSTRA VOTE</p>
<p>Farmers say the vote in the Senate for the partial sale of Telstra will mean a better deal for people in the bush.</p>
<p>The National Farmers Federation says privatisation will make Telstra more accountable and responsive and better placed to respond to change, take commercial risks and reap the rewards.</p>
<p>The NFF has welcomed the decision of independent senators, Mal Colston and Brian Harridine, to support the Telstra legislation.</p>
<p>And United Graziers Association chief executive, Michael Prendergast, says it has assurances from the Government that Telstra services will be enhanced for graziers.</p>
<p>He says that means funds from the partial sale will be released for a range of projects.</p>
