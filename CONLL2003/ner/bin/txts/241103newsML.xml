<p>Australian shares plunged to close sharply lower on Friday after comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan spooked traders across Asian markets.</p>
<p>At 4.10 p.m. (0510 GMT), the All Ordinaries index was 69.4 points lower at 2,313.9. December share price index futures were down 85 points at 2,302, an 11.9 point discount to the index.</p>
<p>The fall is the Australian market's largest single day fall since March 11, 1996 when local bourse dived 80.2 points in response to a 171 point fall in the Dow after unexpectedly strong U.S. employment data.  </p>
<p>Speaking at a function in Washington, Greenspan said the U.S. central bank needed to be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infected stock and other asset markets as that could end up doing damage to the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Brokers said traders were concerned the comments could cause a serious retracement on Wall Street when it opens later today and were trying to pre-empt any such correction.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan spoke after the American market closed so they are trying double guess how far the American market is going to be down by,&quot; said head of equities at Intersuisse, Andrew Sekely.  </p>
<p>While the implications of Greenspan's comments were not completely clear, traders already tense ahead of the U.S. November employment report preferred not to wait and see how the numbers came out. &quot;If the American market is not down by as much as expected then they might be overreacting, but in the meantime they are prepared for the worse,&quot; Sekely said.</p>
<p>U.S. employment data for November is due later today and traders said these figures had the potential to further deepen negative sentiment in both the U.S. and elsewhere.  </p>
<p>&quot;If that figure does come out worst than expectations, we know Greenspan won't have any qualms about raising interest rates in the U.S. and that will filter through here and crunch our market,&quot; said dealer Scott Mailer of Daiwa Securities.</p>
<p>Interest rate-sensitive stocks were the hardest hit, the banks and finance index crumbling 4.15 percent compared to the broader market's losses of 2.91 percent.</p>
<p>All eyes were on Wall Street with brokers saying non-U.S. markets simply had to wait it out.</p>
<p>&quot;It's difficult to know where to turn. All you can do is cross your fingers and wait,&quot; said a Sydney broker.  </p>
<p>Falls outnumbered rises by a ratio of about five to one, while about 20 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
<p>FUTURES/OPTIONS - Futures activity boomed as traders rushed to cover positions as the SPI rapidly headed south. Options trade was also buoyant, in line with the underlying market's impressive turnover levels. Total options traded 49,314 (36,177) Turnover in December SPI contracts 18,198 (5,865)</p>
<p>In other local markets, Australian bond prices suffered their largest one day fall since March and no analyst was willing to pick the next move after long dated yields spiked 40 basis points at one stage during a frantic session.  </p>
<p>Uncertainty over the course of the economy and monetary policy next year, combined with a plunge in U.S. Treasuries in both New York and Tokyo, left the market on the ropes and even rumours of central bank buying failed make much impression.</p>
<p>By 5.00 p.m. (0600 GMT), 10 year T-bonds were yielding 7.49 percent, up 32 basis points from Thursday.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar was leaning on key support late Friday as an already tense market was further unnerved by a savage selloff in world bonds and stocks and a sudden revival in the yen and mark. By 5.00 p.m. (0600 GMT), the local currency was quoted at US$7950/55, down from US$0.7964/69 late Thursday.  </p>
