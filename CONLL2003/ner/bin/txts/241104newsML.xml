<p>* NZ debt sold sharply at close on global weakness</p>
<p>* U.S. non-farm payrolls to provide next direction</p>
<p>* Rumblings on NZ coalition front keep market on toes</p>
<p>New Zealand bonds ended on Friday more than 20 basis points higher in yield after heavy selling in other dollar bloc countries.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a bit of carnage out there today actually. Everything got smashed -- Canadian, Australian, U.S. -- there was really nothing that came out unscathed,&quot; a Wellington dealer said. </p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries never recovered from a technically-driven sell-off, weakening even further in Tokyo trade as Asian players joined the rush to unwind long positions following the rapid change in sentiment.</p>
<p>Local bonds had opened weaker after the arrival back onshore of several bonds overnight, and then the market jumped on the bandwagon as it witnessed the fate of global markets.</p>
<p>Mid bonds finished 21 basis points higher while the 11/06 maturity was off 24 at 7.28 percent. In the money market, the benchmark 90-day bank bills climbed 11 basis points to 8.50 percent as the currency's Trade-Weighted Index shed 45 points to 66.53.</p>
<p>Dealers said where the market would open up on Monday morning was anyone's guess, with the U.S. Treasuries' reaction to non-farm payrolls data due out after the local close likely to set the scene.</p>
<p>&quot;Also the U.S. chart looks pretty ugly at the moment and I really can't see there being much of a recovery in that,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Local political developments would also drive local bonds, with the prospect of a new government formed in the next few days after weeks of coalition negotiations.</p>
