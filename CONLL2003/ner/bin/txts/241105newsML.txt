New Zealand shares closed 1.38 percent lower on high volume on Friday as international markets reacted strongly to comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

Greenspan said the Federal Reserve must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets.

"This was taken as a sign that the bank considers the equities market to be overvalued," said Don Turkington, Managing Director of Cavill White Securities. He said the local fall reflected real concern about how the U.S. stockmarket would react to Greenspan.  

"It really is a very major selloff...This is anticipating the jitters on Wall Street, a severe case of the jitters, and we don't like those," he said. "She's a very, very nasty-looking market, and this market was down on high volume with solid selling pretty well across the board."

Volume, at $288 million, was very high even discounting an exceptionally large transaction of 31.3 million Telecom shares at $7.48. Industry sources said the trade was a "dividend wash", probably involving a group of foreign institutions lending stock to a third party which is liable for less tax on dividends. Telecom goes ex a 9.5 cent dividend on Monday.  

Political uncertainty was another negative. Ord Minnett's Geoff Brown said there was now less certainty about the likelihood of a coalition between nationalist NZ First and the caretaker National Party government, the outcome favoured by the markets. National and Labour are both seeking to clinch a deal with NZ First before parliament meets next Thursday.

Sky City was among the worst affected stocks, falling 44 cents to $7.78 after announcing a fall in visitor numbers and over-run in budget for its Auckland Sky Tower. Fernz fell 18 to $4.90, while Carter Holt Harvey shed 12 to $3.34 and Fletcher Paper was down seven at $2.70. -- Mark Trevelyan 64 4 471-4277
