<p>New Zealand shares closed 1.38 percent lower on high volume on Friday as international markets reacted strongly to comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.</p>
<p>Greenspan said the Federal Reserve must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stock and other asset markets.</p>
<p>&quot;This was taken as a sign that the bank considers the equities market to be overvalued,&quot; said Don Turkington, Managing Director of Cavill White Securities. He said the local fall reflected real concern about how the U.S. stockmarket would react to Greenspan.  </p>
<p>&quot;It really is a very major selloff...This is anticipating the jitters on Wall Street, a severe case of the jitters, and we don't like those,&quot; he said. &quot;She's a very, very nasty-looking market, and this market was down on high volume with solid selling pretty well across the board.&quot;</p>
<p>Volume, at $288 million, was very high even discounting an exceptionally large transaction of 31.3 million Telecom shares at $7.48. Industry sources said the trade was a &quot;dividend wash&quot;, probably involving a group of foreign institutions lending stock to a third party which is liable for less tax on dividends. Telecom goes ex a 9.5 cent dividend on Monday.  </p>
<p>Political uncertainty was another negative. Ord Minnett's Geoff Brown said there was now less certainty about the likelihood of a coalition between nationalist NZ First and the caretaker National Party government, the outcome favoured by the markets. National and Labour are both seeking to clinch a deal with NZ First before parliament meets next Thursday.</p>
<p>Sky City was among the worst affected stocks, falling 44 cents to $7.78 after announcing a fall in visitor numbers and over-run in budget for its Auckland Sky Tower. Fernz fell 18 to $4.90, while Carter Holt Harvey shed 12 to $3.34 and Fletcher Paper was down seven at $2.70. -- Mark Trevelyan 64 4 471-4277</p>
