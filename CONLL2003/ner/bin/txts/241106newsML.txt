RTRS-OPINION-Jim Middleton's Canberra Closeup-Howard triumphant.

CANBERRA 1996-12-05

By Jim Middleton (ABC TV political correspondent)

With one bound he was free. With the Telstra sell off as an early Christmas present, John Howard can head off to the New South Wales coastal resort of Hawks Nest for a bit of the old slip, slap, slop, basking in the sun with barely a political cloud in the summer sky.

How quickly the dynamics of politics change -- in a day, a week, a year.  

Twelve months ago Howard was chafing at the bit, trying to keep his ambition in check as Alexander Downer stumbled from bad to worse to appalling. It was over the summer break (and at Hawks Nest) he dreamed up the Telstra-environment trade-off, a deal designed to kill two electoral birds with one stone.

It would do something to neutralise Labor's long-held ascendancy on the environment but handcuff the issue to an opportunity that Howard valued much more -- getting his hands on the proceeds of the long overdue privatisation of Telstra.

It's worked.  

Just one week ago, it seemed possible the coalition's first year in office would bear little fruit -- a much watered down industrial relations reform package and an ambitious but significantly hacked-about deficit reduction programme would be all.

Its higher education reforms -- designed to yield A$1.7 billion -- were mired in the Senate with every prospect of rejection.

Peter Costello's overly aggressive statements about double dissolution elections threatened the chances of its Telstra legislation ever being proclaimed.  

One day ago, the tectonic plates of Senate politics shifted and the tremors will reverberate for a very long time.

The dynamics of Senate politics may be changed forever.

It may even become the states house the fathers of federation intended a century ago.

John Howard and the Independents were the winners. The Democrats, Labor and the Greens the clear losers, their leverage clearly diminished, their reputations bruised.  

The prime minister has said proudly more than once he doesn't do deals -- Brian Harradine was outraged that Cheryl Kernot branded "a bribe" the A$350 million of pork he and Mal Colston had just extracted.

What else was it? A$350 million of principle?

Cheryl Kernot has been yelping about porkbarrelling and a shoddy deal. But it was the Democrats who wrote the book on Senate horsetrading. Budgets have been torn about, the efficiency of tax on wine eroded, wholesale sales taxes turned back. They've been at it for nearly two decades.  

Kernot says yesterday's events represent the arrival of blatant American-style porkbarrelling to Australia. But what about her behaviour on the Workplace Relations Bill?

Many in small and large business point out that her bowdlerisation of the Reith package will cost the economy dearly -- that it will slow reform of the labour market, slow job creation, slow economic growth.

How many hundreds of millions of dollars -- even billions of dollars -- will be foregone in the process?  

Cheryl Kernot may not like it but some proponents of labour market reform might well argue that it was every bit as significant a piece of horse trading as the Harradine-Colston heist.

Greater protections for workers were traded off against higher growth.

The Democrats now have to rethink their role.

There may be nearly four times as many of them as the Harradine-Colston axis, but the real power in the Senate lies with the Independents, unless the Democrats are prepared to deal -- as they did over Workplace Relations.  

It was a red-letter day for the government, but not for the National Party. After all, despite all the angst in the bust about the impact of budget and other cuts, who was it who delivered to regional Australia?

Not the six Nats in the Senate but two Independents.

There's already been private outrage at the highest levels in the parliamentary National Party as they watched Harradine and Colston take the creditt.  

It may hasten the retreat of the National Party into state-based rural rumps -- more a conservative ginger group than a real coalition partner. Certainly it will make already outspoken mavericks like Bob Katter harder to corral.

And then there's Labor.

For the alternative government, this is the worst of all possible outcomes.

It's lost and will have to oppose any further privatisation of Telstra at the next poll -- or face coalition cries of hypocrisy.  

Thousands of mums and dads are about to become investors in Telstra, happily reaping the dividends and watching their investments grow in the run up to the election.

That will help John Howard sleep peacefully over the summer.

And there's also the fate of the other two-thirds of Telstra.

The coalition now has a potential nest egg to offer all manner of bribes at the election.

Sell the rest of Telstra, for instance, to cut personal and corporate taxes, introduce a GST and fund the compensation package.  

How's that for a start?
