The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) rejects what it sees as assertions by the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) that the Singapore exchange has squatters' rights to trade Taiwan stock futures because of its Asian base, a CME official said on Friday.

The CME plans to offer Taiwan stock market futures and options on the Chicago exchange from January 9 after reaching a licensing agreement to use the Dow Jones Taiwan Stock Index.  

SIMEX is planning its own launch next month using the SIMEX Morgan Stanley Capital International Taiwan Index although no specific date has been set yet.

"These are two similar contracts and the indices are quite similar as well," Paul Shang, senior director of Asian development of the CME, said in an interview.

He said he disagrees with SIMEX's view that because of its location in Asian SIMEX is the logical setting for the contract.

"The CME feels that it has a worldwide market and this is the first Asian product outside of Japan that the CME has launched," he said.  

"Clearly this is a case where there will a fight for market share in Asian trading," Shang said.

Competition will likely intensify further when Taiwan opens its own futures exchange in July.

SIMEX officials were unavailable for immediate comment.

Earlier this week, SIMEX said it was confident its contracts would prove popular with fund managers.

At stake, said Shang, was access to the world's sixth largest stock market in terms of dollar turnover.

"It's right up there with the U.S., Japan and Germany so it's an important Asian equity market," Shang said.  

"Whoever can launch a successful futures contract on this market, is going to draw all the foreign institutional investors into using this contract," he said.

Moreover, this had wider implications for other markets in Asia where investment funds were looking at opportunities in emerging markets, Shang said.

Taiwan is scrambling to open its futures exchange and launch products by July in a bid to keep business at home but the lack of laws covering futures is seen as an obstacle.  

A committee of the Legislative Yuan (parliament) has passed a draft law but the full parliament has yet to adopt final legislation. With the year-end recess just days away, analysts said the chances for the bill's imminent passage were fading.

"If SIMEX can not get started, fast enough ... we're going to have the market to ourselves, at least in the beginning," said Shang, who s in Sydney to attend the Asia-Pacific Futures Forum.
