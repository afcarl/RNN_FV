AMLC COMMENTARY: Cattle prices were slightly firmer in Queensland but slightly easier in southern Australia this week.

A major focus for both cattle and sheepmeat production was the Australian dollar, which after briefly bursting through 82 US cents on Tuesday night plummeted to 78.5 cents before recovering to 79.8 cents on Friday morning.

Each one percent rise in the Australian dollar reduces returns to Australian beef and sheapmeat industries by about A$30 million. This is worth slightly less than A$5.00 a head for cattle, not A$25.00 as earlier reported.  

The one cent depreciation of the dollar over the week helped lift returns to Australian exporters from overseas markets.

Measured in U.S. currency, prices for manufacturing beef exports to the U.S. eased this week, but FAS returns were up with 90 CL cow beef rising 2 cents/kg to 180 cents/kg and grassfed fullsets to Japan rising 5 cents/kg to 340 cents/kg.

The drop in the dollar came too late for successful Australian exporters in the latest Korean tender, who submit bids in U.S. cents per lb.  

On the basis of an Australian dollar worth 81.5 U.S. cents, prices in the latest tender were down by about 15 cents/kg on the previous tender.

Australia's market share of the latest tender was also down, the result of fiercer New Zealand competition reflecting the seasonal upturn in production. Australian exporters won 33 percent of the 3,410 tonnes of grassfed quarters tendered, with New Zealand suppliers securing the remainder.

In the grassfed fullset segment, Australian exporters were awarded 44 percent of the 648 tonnes tendered.  

With marginally improved market conditions this week and tight cattle supplies in Queensland, cattle prices in that state moved slightly higher.

Across southern Queensland, auction market bullocks rose by eight cents/kg, cows rose 2 cents/kg and export steer prices held firm.

In Victoria, cattle yardings increased 14 percent and prices eased slightly. There continues to be large differences in livestock prices between Victoria and Queensland.  

Cattle slaughter in Queensland last week was 44,274 head, only marginally different from the week before. Cattle slaughter in New South Wales was 43,196 head.

In the seven days to December 5, total cattle slaughter in the U.S. was 730,000 head and cow slaughter for the week to November 23 was 162,700 head, up 35 percent on a year before.

Estimated third quarter beef consumption in the U.S. was down about 4.5 percent, despite a five percent drop in real beef prices, perhaps reflecting publicity over BSE and E.Coli.
