<title>AUSTRALIA: Court ejects head of Australian child-sex inquiry.</title>
<headline>Court ejects head of Australian child-sex inquiry.</headline>
<dateline>CANBERRA 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Australian opposition on Friday demanded a high-powered investigation into paedophilia in the Australian diplomatic service after the federal court forced the head of the existing inquiry to stand aside.</p>
<p>The court said inquiry head Chris Hunt might be biased, since he privately told a newspaper he had turned up no major evidence of paedophile activity, even though he still had months' of investigation before him.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we are left with a ruinous wreck beyond salvage and a continuing pall of doubt and suspicion hanging over our diplomatic service,&quot; opposition foreign affairs spokesman Laurie Brereton said.</p>
<p>But the government responded by pressing ahead with the original inquiry, established in May, appointing a new head to lead it.</p>
<p>Critics say that if there were many paedophiles in senior posts in the Foreign Affairs Department then a secret inquiry would be open to internal influence and would become a public service whitewash.</p>
<p>Accordingly, they demand an open investigation.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said the appointment of a new inquiry head, administrative law expert Pamela O'Neil, showed the government's commitment to pursue the matter. A report is due in May next year.</p>
<p>One Australian diplomat has been prosecuted this year for having sex with a Cambodian boy under 16 but was acquitted.</p>
<p>Police have investigated others.</p>
<p>A newspaper reported allegations in April that diplomats had directed Australian government aid to certain foreign orphanages to secure sex with children.</p>
