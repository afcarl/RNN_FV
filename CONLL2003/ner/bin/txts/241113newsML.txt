Sexually harrased Australia workers dial hotline.

SYDNEY 1996-12-06

Australian bank workers who get sexually harassed at Christmas parties will be able to phone a special hotline set up by the Finance Sector Union (FSU) to deal with their complaints, the union said on Friday.

"Sexual harassment is a widespread problem in our industry," FSU spokesperson Lynne Poleson said in a statement.

"Last Christmas, a union survey showed that 18 percent of employees had suffered serious sexual harassment and a massive 48 percent had experienced unwelcome and offensive remarks," Poleson said.

Over 65 percent of finance sector workers are women and many work in the junior levels of banking and insurance, she said.

The hotline is for men and women with any queries they have about harassment. She told Reuters the type of harassment cases vary from being seen as a joke to some that are quite serious, but each hotline caller will be given couselling.
