<p>Australian bonds suffered their largest one day fall since March as yields spiked 40 basis points at one stage during a frantic session, before closing up around 7.50 percent, the highest level since late October.</p>
<p>Analysts were unwilling to predict the next move, in front of the key U.S. labour force report for November later on Friday. &quot;It's been a horrible, horrible day,&quot; said a trader at a European bank in Sydney.</p>
<p>Uncertainty over the Australian economy and monetary policy next year, combined with a plunge in U.S. Treasuries in both New York and Tokyo, left the market on the ropes. Even rumours of central bank buying failed to make much impression.</p>
<p>While the move was seen as wildly overdone, being exaggrated by heavy technically-driven liquidation, the market still has to negotiate the key U.S. non-farm payrolls report later on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot depends on how the non-farm payrolls come out now. If that's on the high side of expectations you may get even a further bout of this before its comes back to more realistic levels,&quot; said Stephen Roberts, chief economist at UBS Australia.</p>
<p>November non-farm payrolls are forecast to rise 179,000 after a 210,000 increase in October, but markets have become increasingly jittery that they could be a lot stronger.</p>
<p>However, the local outlook has also become clouded with some analysts pointing to this week's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) numbers as a sign the economy is far from falling over, and indeed, could rebound early next year.</p>
<p>&quot;Another rate cut is not a foregone conclusion. It's definitely less than an even money chance, particularly with the outlook for growth a little better,&quot; said John Kyriakopoulos, senior economist at Macquarie Bank.</p>
<p>Third quarter GDP, reported on Wednesday rose 0.8 percent to an annual growth rate of 3.8 percent.</p>
<p>The market had built up a head of steam prior to last Tuesday's Reserve Bank of Australia board meeting, anticipating a further easing when the Australian dollar was running on a six-year high against the U.S. dollar, around 82 U.S. cents.</p>
<p>Since then the dollar has tumbled to 79.73 U.S. cents and there is a growing realisation that a further monetary policy easing is extremely unlikely until February or March, if at all.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank last cut rates by 50 basis points on November 6 to 6.50 percent.</p>
<p>The 10-year bond yield had already been looking fairly heavy in the last few days after several attempts to go sub-7.0 percent failed and as a three-month rally from 8.30 percent was showing definite signs of being on its last legs.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very hard to build a case why bond yields should be any lower than 7.0 percent, because which ever way you cut it, you had to have weak growth continuing, and a cast iron case why the Reserve Bank was going to cut rates again,&quot; UBS's Roberts said. &quot;The truth of the matter there is not a cast iron case and so the market is genuinely split.&quot;</p>
