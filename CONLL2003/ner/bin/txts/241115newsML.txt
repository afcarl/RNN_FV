NZ markets tumble on local, global factors.

New Zealand financial markets tumbled on Friday on a combination of local and global factors.

The share market fell 1.38 percent, the New Zealand dollar dropped half a U.S. cent before staging a partial recovery and bond yields rose 20 basis points.

"It's pretty bearish," said one foreign exchange dealer.

There were a several factors affecting the markets -- uncertainty about which parties would form the government, comments from Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash on Thursday that the local dollar was near the top of its cycle and comments the same say from U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.

After eight weeks of impasse since the inconclusive October 12 election the New Zealand First Party, holding the balance of power, is on the verge of chosing between the conservative caretaker National Party government and the left-leaning Labour Party.

A National-New Zealand First coalition is favoured by markets and partly priced in but investors are nervous that the choice might go with Labour. Few clues have been given about which way NZ First will go.

Comments by Brash on Thursday that the New Zealand economy was at a turning point and his expected loosening of monetary policy at the bank's December 17 Monetary Policy Statement were weighing on the currency.

Adding to this were comments from Greenspan, who said the U.S. Federal Reserve must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets.

His view led to selling in dollar bloc currencies but had the most impact on the equities market where there were fears of a big fall on Wall Street on Friday.

"This was taken as a sign that the bank considers the equities market to be overvalued," said Don Turkington, managing director of Cavill White Securities.

"This is anticipating the jitters on Wall Street, a severe case of the jitters, and we don't like those," he added. "She's a very, very nasty-looking market, and this (Wellington) market was down on high volume with solid selling pretty well across the board."

Share market volume, at NZ$288 million, was very high even discounting an exceptionally large transaction of 31.3 million Telecom shares at $7.48.

Ord Minnett broker Geoff Brown said there was now less certainty about the likelihood of a coalition between nationalist NZ First and the National Party government.

Parties are holding meetings over the weekend and a government is expected to be announced on Tuesday or Wednesday.

There was heavy selling in the debt market, too.

"There was a bit of carnage out there today actually. Everything got smashed -- Canadian, Australian, U.S. -- there was really nothing that came out unscathed," a Wellington bond dealer said.

The New Zealand top-40 share index ended at 2,360.92, down 33 points.

Local bonds had opened weaker after the arrival back onshore of several bonds overnight, and the market jumped on the bandwagon as it witnessed the fate of global markets.

The yield on mid bonds finished 21 basis points higher while the 11/06 maturity was up 24 points at 7.28 percent.

In the money market, benchmark 90-day bank bills climbed 11 basis points to 8.50 percent as the currency's Trade Weighted Index shed 45 points to 66.53.

Dealers said where the market would open on Monday morning was anyone's guess, with U.S. Treasuries' reaction to non-farm payrolls data due later on Friday providing clues as to direction. $1 = NZ$1.42
