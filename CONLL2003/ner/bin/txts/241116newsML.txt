RTRS-"Mating" of zinc industry still some way off.

As the so-called zinc mating season approaches, pitting miners against smelting and refining companies over annual treatment charges, the sides remain far apart on fees, industry participants said on Friday.

The miners, citing recent scale-backs in production for various reasons, are arguing for a reduction from last year's average fee of US$190.00 a tonne, while smelters are pressing for an increase, they said.  

There are no hard and fast rules on when contracts must be signed. The charges, called "TCs", are typically settled in early February, although negotiations usually start several months earlier and can run into the northern spring.

Trade sources said Australian mining companies such as MIM Holdings Ltd and Pasminco Ltd are looking to pay about US$155.00 a tonne to have material from its Queensland deposits treated by Japanese smelters.

The Japanese, these same sources said, are seeking upwards of US$197.00 a tonne in some instances.  

Most of the zinc concentrates shipped from Australia are smelted in Japan or Korea. "I would assume its going to a long and drawn out negotiation," a trader in concentrates said.

One reason cited for the high discrepancy in the price miners want to pay and smelters will accept may be the lengthy negotiating period. "Miners are hoping the talks will drag out unitl late February or March or even April until the expected concentrate cuts come in," another trader said.

Expectations of a surplus supply of concentrates in 1997 has largely fallen over after a decision to suspend mining at Anvil Range's Faro lead/zinc mine for three months from December 20.  

Some uncertainty over mine production levels at the Tara mine in Ireland and Morrocan production, and aggressive Chinese efforts to lure more foreign material to its under-utilised smelting industry, is providing miners some bargaining chips.

However, a buyer of concentrates for Chinese smelters told Reuters little material was being made available in Australia ahead the start in earnest of miner-smelter negotiations.

"The miners are not willing to give up anything at the moment," the buyer said.

"They are keeping it untile the benchmark price is set."  

In times of surplus, smelters are better able to command a premium for treatment of concentrates, while in surplus year miners generally hold better cards.
