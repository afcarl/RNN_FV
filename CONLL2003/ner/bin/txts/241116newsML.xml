<p>As the so-called zinc mating season approaches, pitting miners against smelting and refining companies over annual treatment charges, the sides remain far apart on fees, industry participants said on Friday.</p>
<p>The miners, citing recent scale-backs in production for various reasons, are arguing for a reduction from last year's average fee of US$190.00 a tonne, while smelters are pressing for an increase, they said.  </p>
<p>There are no hard and fast rules on when contracts must be signed. The charges, called &quot;TCs&quot;, are typically settled in early February, although negotiations usually start several months earlier and can run into the northern spring.</p>
<p>Trade sources said Australian mining companies such as MIM Holdings Ltd and Pasminco Ltd are looking to pay about US$155.00 a tonne to have material from its Queensland deposits treated by Japanese smelters.</p>
<p>The Japanese, these same sources said, are seeking upwards of US$197.00 a tonne in some instances.  </p>
<p>Most of the zinc concentrates shipped from Australia are smelted in Japan or Korea. &quot;I would assume its going to a long and drawn out negotiation,&quot; a trader in concentrates said.</p>
<p>One reason cited for the high discrepancy in the price miners want to pay and smelters will accept may be the lengthy negotiating period. &quot;Miners are hoping the talks will drag out unitl late February or March or even April until the expected concentrate cuts come in,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Expectations of a surplus supply of concentrates in 1997 has largely fallen over after a decision to suspend mining at Anvil Range's Faro lead/zinc mine for three months from December 20.  </p>
<p>Some uncertainty over mine production levels at the Tara mine in Ireland and Morrocan production, and aggressive Chinese efforts to lure more foreign material to its under-utilised smelting industry, is providing miners some bargaining chips.</p>
<p>However, a buyer of concentrates for Chinese smelters told Reuters little material was being made available in Australia ahead the start in earnest of miner-smelter negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;The miners are not willing to give up anything at the moment,&quot; the buyer said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are keeping it untile the benchmark price is set.&quot;  </p>
<p>In times of surplus, smelters are better able to command a premium for treatment of concentrates, while in surplus year miners generally hold better cards.</p>
