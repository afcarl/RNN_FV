NZ's Wilson & Horton turns over a new leaf.

Publisher Wilson & Horton has undergone a change of culture over the past 8 months from one of heavy family involvement to a corporate entity, chief operating officer John Maasland said on Friday.

"The biggest change has been the move from a family run business to a true corporate organisation and I suppose you've got to thank the Irish for that," Maasland said in an interview.

It was Brierley Investments (BIL) which launched an overnight raid on the publisher of the New Zealand Herald late in 1993, gaining a 28 percent stake with consummate ease, which in itself reflected investor dissatisfaction.

Horton family interests, with a significant stake of their own, were distinctly uncomfortable with a corporate raider in their midst.

The result was a search for a friendly party to relieve the ever acquisitive BIL of its holding.

That partner turned out to be Dublin-based Independent Newspapers, headed by Heinz chief executive Tony O'Reilly.

Independent now holds over 86 percent of the stock and has not stopped there. Independent is heavily involved in a consortium that bought Radio New Zealand's commercial radio network, Prospect Radio and Independent Radio News.

Maasland said BIL's entry into the proud and proper Wilson & Horton was traumatic at the time. "But in the end, Wilson & Horton had to change," he said.

The Herald, the only major daily newspaper operating in Auckland, was suffering declining circulation while the region's population overflowed.

"It had not realised that Auckland had grown, it had become a much more multicultural city, and it was still providing a paper for what was the older age group," he said.

Maasland said the decline had been arrested following a major revamp in August and circulation was improving.

He said the appointment of Gavin Ellis as editor had drawn flak at the time, with commentators doubting the in-house promotion would be enough to change the paper's staid image. "But he has done that," he said.

Contrary to popular belief the company, which employs about 2,800 people, was not overstaffed, the Cambridge-educated Maasland said. It had "fined down" its operation, but not by much.

"It's quite an efficient organisation and always has been in that sense. In some ways we are quite light," he said.

In retrospect, increasing the weekend cover price to NZ$1 (US$0.70) in November 1995 was a mistake, Maasland said.

"The paper was on a bit of a slide anyway. It was not really meeting the needs of the Auckland market and we were seeing quite a substantial decline in the rural areas.

"When we increased it to $1, I think we shot ourselves rather heavily in the foot, which was probably not a bad idea... We woke ourselves up," Maasland said.

The re-build of the Herald was not over.

The business pages will be completely revamped to become a section by around February or March and changes are afoot for the Saturday edition, which has a print run of more than 250,000.

"It has not, by any means, reached its zenith, but the feeling within the company and the editorial team is that we have a lot of things to do," Maasland said.

Wilson and Horton reported a NZ$18.2 million profit in the six months to June, which was flat compared with the corresponding period last year. $1 = NZ$1.42
