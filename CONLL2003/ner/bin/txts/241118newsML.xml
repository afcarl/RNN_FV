<p>Publisher Wilson &amp; Horton has undergone a change of culture over the past 8 months from one of heavy family involvement to a corporate entity, chief operating officer John Maasland said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest change has been the move from a family run business to a true corporate organisation and I suppose you've got to thank the Irish for that,&quot; Maasland said in an interview.</p>
<p>It was Brierley Investments (BIL) which launched an overnight raid on the publisher of the New Zealand Herald late in 1993, gaining a 28 percent stake with consummate ease, which in itself reflected investor dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Horton family interests, with a significant stake of their own, were distinctly uncomfortable with a corporate raider in their midst.</p>
<p>The result was a search for a friendly party to relieve the ever acquisitive BIL of its holding.</p>
<p>That partner turned out to be Dublin-based Independent Newspapers, headed by Heinz chief executive Tony O'Reilly.</p>
<p>Independent now holds over 86 percent of the stock and has not stopped there. Independent is heavily involved in a consortium that bought Radio New Zealand's commercial radio network, Prospect Radio and Independent Radio News.</p>
<p>Maasland said BIL's entry into the proud and proper Wilson &amp; Horton was traumatic at the time. &quot;But in the end, Wilson &amp; Horton had to change,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Herald, the only major daily newspaper operating in Auckland, was suffering declining circulation while the region's population overflowed.</p>
<p>&quot;It had not realised that Auckland had grown, it had become a much more multicultural city, and it was still providing a paper for what was the older age group,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Maasland said the decline had been arrested following a major revamp in August and circulation was improving.</p>
<p>He said the appointment of Gavin Ellis as editor had drawn flak at the time, with commentators doubting the in-house promotion would be enough to change the paper's staid image. &quot;But he has done that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief the company, which employs about 2,800 people, was not overstaffed, the Cambridge-educated Maasland said. It had &quot;fined down&quot; its operation, but not by much.</p>
<p>&quot;It's quite an efficient organisation and always has been in that sense. In some ways we are quite light,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In retrospect, increasing the weekend cover price to NZ$1 (US$0.70) in November 1995 was a mistake, Maasland said.</p>
<p>&quot;The paper was on a bit of a slide anyway. It was not really meeting the needs of the Auckland market and we were seeing quite a substantial decline in the rural areas.</p>
<p>&quot;When we increased it to $1, I think we shot ourselves rather heavily in the foot, which was probably not a bad idea... We woke ourselves up,&quot; Maasland said.</p>
<p>The re-build of the Herald was not over.</p>
<p>The business pages will be completely revamped to become a section by around February or March and changes are afoot for the Saturday edition, which has a print run of more than 250,000.</p>
<p>&quot;It has not, by any means, reached its zenith, but the feeling within the company and the editorial team is that we have a lot of things to do,&quot; Maasland said.</p>
<p>Wilson and Horton reported a NZ$18.2 million profit in the six months to June, which was flat compared with the corresponding period last year. $1 = NZ$1.42</p>
