RTRS-"Dr Doom" Faber sees world economic troubles.

SYDNEY 1996-12-06

The world is undergoing changes similar to those characterising the periods leading up to the deflationary recession after 1873 and the 1920s which preceded the Great Depression, Hong Kong-based investment adviser Marc Faber, better known as "Doctor Doom", said on Friday.

"The threat of a deflationary recession beginning sometime over the next six to nine months is higher than it has ever been since the late 1920s," Faber said in a speech to a futures exchange regulators meeting in Sydney.  

A deflationary recession would have very negative implications on growth in Asia, where massive over-investment based on optimistic export expectations have been made in many countries, said Faber, author of the "Gloom, Boom and Doom Report."

"Slower growth or recessions would also lead to a less stable political environment," Faber said.

He said he doubted monetary policies would be able to steer the global economy around a deflationary recession, largely because the damage had already been done.  

"In a deflationary recession, the highest quality bonds significantly outperform lower quality bonds," Faber said.
