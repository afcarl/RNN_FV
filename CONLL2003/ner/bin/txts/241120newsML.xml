<p>The world is undergoing changes similar to those characterising the periods leading up to the deflationary recession after 1873 and the 1920s which preceded the Great Depression, Hong Kong-based investment adviser Marc Faber, better known as &quot;Doctor Doom&quot;, said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The threat of a deflationary recession beginning sometime over the next six to nine months is higher than it has ever been since the late 1920s,&quot; Faber said in a speech to a futures exchange regulators meeting in Sydney.  </p>
<p>A deflationary recession would have very negative implications on growth in Asia, where massive over-investment based on optimistic export expectations have been made in many countries, said Faber, author of the &quot;Gloom, Boom and Doom Report.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Slower growth or recessions would also lead to a less stable political environment,&quot; Faber said.</p>
<p>He said he doubted monetary policies would be able to steer the global economy around a deflationary recession, largely because the damage had already been done.  </p>
<p>&quot;In a deflationary recession, the highest quality bonds significantly outperform lower quality bonds,&quot; Faber said.</p>
