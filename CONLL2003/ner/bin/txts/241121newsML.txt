SYDNEY 1996-12-06

Transport group Finemore Holdings Ltd said on Friday it had renewed a three-year contract for the national delivery of vehicles to all General Motors Holden's Automotive (GMHA) dealers.

GMHA is a unit of General Motors Corp.

In addition, Finemore said it had also won a three-year contract for the intrastate and interstate transport of materials to GMHA manufacturing plants, which starts in April.

Finemore said it will introduce a new U.S. based software system for the tracking and scheduling of materials deliveries.  

"This system will be used for the first time in Australia on the new GMHA contract, and is one of the added value services that are part of Finemores' logistics capabilities," managing director Ron Finemore said in a statement.

Finemore shares closed steady at A$2.93 on Friday.
