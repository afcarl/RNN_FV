RTRS-Australia dlr recoils as world markets spasm.

SYDNEY 1996-12-06

The Australian dollar was leaning on key support late Friday as an already tense market was further unnerved by a savage selloff in world bonds and stocks and a sudden revival in the yen and mark.

Traders said the mood had been dark enough in the wake of the tumble from 82 cents at the start of the week and became bleaker through the day as domestic bonds plunged, Japanese investors dumped A$ holdings and US$/mark fell out of bed.

"People are shaking their heads wondering what the hell's going on," said one. "It feels like everyone in Japan is selling AUD/yen, AUD/mark vanished and who knows what bonds are up to?"  

By 5.00 pm (0600 GMT) the local dollar had its back to the wall at US$0.7950/55 after an early tilt at the upside found a hostile reception at US$0.7995 resistance.

It was also down on Thursday's soft US$0.7964/69 and a world away from Monday's six-year peak of US$0.8212. That relapse had been largely triggered by fears of a domestic rate cut, but today's pressure was all foreign inspired.

"Essentially, the world was long dollars and long bonds and nervous about it," said a trader at a European bank here. "The wild swings seen in the high yielders earlier in the week had made people feel think twice about the wisdom of this."  

The creeping self doubt crystalised into near panic when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan remarked that central banks must be wary when irrational exuberence infects stocks and other assets.

"People inferred he was talking about current conditions and, essentially, threatening to put the brakes on if bond or equity prices rose any further," said the dealer. "Now, that impression might be right, or it might be wrong, but nobody's going to sit on a long position while they wait to find out."

And there was no doubt everybody was long after months of ceasless appreciation in bond and stock prices.  

Domestic bonds nosedived, sending the 10-year yield soaring 32 basis points to a five-week high at 7.49 percent.

Traders said Japanese investors were amongst the most aggressive sellers as they were stuffed with dollars after swallowing truck loads of yen/A$ dual currency samurai bonds this year. That saw the dollar sink to 89.10/20 yen from 89.75/85 late Thursday and a high of 93.80 on Monday.

Losses were equally large against the mark -- another low yielding currency which has lost out to the A$ in recent weeks -- where it sank to 1.2236/47 marks from 1.2380/92 late Thursday and a top of no less than 1.2812 last Monday.  

Measured against a basket of currencies from Australia's major trading partners the dollar declined to 58.8 from 59.0 late Thursday and a 60.6 high at the start of the week.

Analysts were bemused by the scale of the reaction, noting that nothing fundamnetal had changed in the last week to warrant such a re-rating of the dollar or bonds.

Australian economic growth was cantering along at a steady 3.0-3.5 percent, there was little inflationary pressure to speak of and yields were highly attractive compared to those in Japan, or much of Europe for that matter, they said. The technical outlook had been clouded by its pullback from 82 cents.  

Daily indicators were showing bearish divergence which pointed to the risk of a deeper correction to US$0.7850 support, but US$0.7950 had held up well today and the longer that remained so, the more chance it would see US$0.8050 first.

However, they conceded that all bets would be off if U.S. labour data tonight proved much stronger than expected and re-ignited speculation about a tightening in policy there.

Non-far payrolls are expected to rise 179,000 after a 219,000 gain in October. Such a result would be policy neutral but the Treasury market, at least, feared it could be a lot more upbeat than that. -- Wayne Cole 61-2 9373 1800
