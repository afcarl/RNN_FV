<p>QUESTION OF THE WEEK - Following the release of third quarter economic growth data last Wednesday, economists were asked for preliminary forecasts of fourth quarter GDP. Generally a small rise is expected, although it will be smaller than the 0.8 percent of the September quarter, and also smaller than the 0.8 percent increase of the December 1995 quarter, meaning that in year-to terms GDP growth would slow to around 3.5 percent.</p>
<p>Business inventories are expected to make a detraction from growth in the fourth quarter, while economists said that after some recent weakness public expenditure could be expected to make a contribution to growth.</p>
<p>While the forecasts are only preliminary, they do show that most economists are looking for the record run of 21 quarters of positive growth to be extended, and they said that while economic activity is slowing, the economy is not likely to grind to a halt.</p>

<p>FOREIGN DEBT - Net foreign debt is expected to have risen slightly over the quarter, although economists will not know the final split between equity and debt funding until the release of the quarterly balance of payments on Tuesday. The current account is expected to have added to the outstanding debt, while the currency effects are seen as miminal. A rise in line with expectations should not trouble the market, economists said.</p>
<p>HOUSING FINANCE - These numbers date from before the last rate cut, and are expected to show a fairly large fall based on Australian Bankers Association figures. Housing is showing some signs of recovery as the end of 1996 approaches, and economists said the anecdotal evidence suggests that new lending may have picked up quite strongly after the November 6 rate cut.</p>
<p>LABOUR FORCE - Employment is still soft, and will remain so probably until the second quarter of next year, economists believe. The impact of the rate cuts will not be seen for some time yet, and so no good news is expected just yet. With the ANZ job advertisement series still weak, and employment a lagging indicator of growth, trend growth of around 10,000 positions per month could be expected. This may not be enough to stop the unemployment rate reaching 9.0 percent in coming months, but it should not move much higher than that. This is the mid month of the quarter, so it will be month that is used for the fourth quarter GDP calculations.</p>
