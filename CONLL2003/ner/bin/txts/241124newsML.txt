RTRS-AWF boosts Australia wheat f'cast to 21.28 mt.

SYDNEY 1996-12-06

Private grains forecaster Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF) has further increased its forecast for Australia's 1996/97 wheat production by 180,000 tones to 21.28 million tonnes.

AWF's previous forecast, issued last month, was 21.10 million tonnes.

The upgrade follows the increased forecast by the official commodities forecasting agency the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics to 21.3 million tonnes from its previous forecast of 20.9 million tonnes earlier this week.  

The Australian Wheat Board's (AWB) forecast remains on 21.0 million tonnes.

AWF said in its latest forecast, released on Friday, that Australia's wheat harvest was now well advanced, with the Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) crops more than half way through the harvest.

Progress in Victoria, South Australia (SA) and Western Australia (WA) was slower as growers have been harvesting canola and barley before wheat, AWF said.

"The key factor about this wheat crop is its quality soundness," AWF said.  

Although the second highest Australian wheat crop ever, wheats so far delivered had been predominantly categories that were well-suited for milling, it said.

Each of the main AWB pool categories would be well represented in the board's export inventory at the end of the harvest, it said.

But as the harvest still had some way to go, significant tonnages of weather damaged wheats were still possible, it said.

Areas where weather damage was the greatest threat were Queensland and northern NSW, where the harvest was most advanced, AWF said.  

Weather damaged wheat had become a feature of the central Queensland harvest, which started in early October, it said.

Growers placed most of the high protein downgraded wheat into warehouses and not the pool, AWF said.

As the harvest moved to southern Queensland the weather damage problem faded, it said.

While NSW had had an excellent run of weather conditions for the harvest, frost damage resulted in some samples of high protein wheats showing a high percentage of small grains, it said.  

In the late-running Victorian harvest, most wheat would go to either Australian Premium White or Australian Standard White, with heavy applications of nitrogenous fertiliser boosting the grain protein level.

The growing season finished abruptly in SA, but satisfactory yields were achieved in all areas except the Eyre Peninsula and the south-east, it said. "The hard finish helped with grain protein. The wheat is sound," AWF said.

First wheat deliveries to the Geraldton zone were running as high as 30 percent of samples with small grain size. The percentage is now running much lower, it said.  

Rain on ripe wheat in the Great Southern area delayed the harvest and robbed the grain of a percentage point or two in protein, it said.

With the harvest haviung about three weeks to run, any further rain in the Great Southern would put a large tonnage of wheat at risk of being downgraded, AWF said.

AWF's state crop forecasts, in million tonnes, and area estimates, in million hectares, are as follows-
