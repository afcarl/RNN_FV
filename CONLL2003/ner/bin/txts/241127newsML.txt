MELBOURNE 1996-12-06

Australian new vehicle sales rose one percent in the first 11 months of 1996 compared with a year earlier, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI) said on Friday.

Vehicles sales for the 11 months to November totalled 595,834, up from 589,653 a year earlier, the industry organisation said in its monthly VFACTS publication.

Sales in November fell to 55,368 from 55,805 in October and 55,526 a year earlier.  

"With 0.8 of a selling day less in November versus October, this reduction translates to an increase in daily rate terms of 48.5 vehicles per day or 2.3 percent," the FCAI said.

The FCAI has forecast total Australian vehicle sales of 650,000, up 20,000 from 1995.

Passenger car sales to November totalled 451,041, up from 447,634 a year earlier, after sales of 41,229 in the month of November, down from 42,137 in November 1995.

Truck sales for the year to date total 144,793 compared with 142,019 a year earlier after November sales of 14,139, up from 13,389 a year earlier.  

Within the total truck sales, light truck sales totalled 130,959 for the year to November, up from 125,602 a year earlier, after sales of 12,761 in the month of November, up from 11,894 in November 1995.

Heavy truck sales amounted to 13,834 for the year to November, down from 16,417 a year earlier, after sales of 1,378 in November, down from 1,495 a year earlier.

"The year-to-date 1996 market is now running ahead of the same period in 1995 by one percent or 6,181 vehicles," the FCAI said.  

"The passenger market is up by 3,407 vehicles, or 0.8 percent," the FCAI said.

"This is attributable to the continued strength of the small car segment, coupled with a solid, although weakening, performance in the upper medium car segment and to a lesser extent the luxury car segment and the people mover segment," the organisation said.

Among the vehicle manufacturers with plants in Australia, Ford Motor Co maintained its market lead in the year to date with sales of 120,913 for a market share of 20.3 percent but this was down from a year earlier when sales of 125,034  

represented a market share of 21.2 percent.

The market share of General Motors Co increased to 19.7 percent with sales of 117,177 vehicles, up from 115,245 a year earlier when its market share was 19.5 percent.

Toyota Motor Co sold 110,931 vehicles for an 18.6 percent share of the market.

In the year-earlier period, Toyota sold 111,007 vehicles, which represented a market share of 18.8 percent.  

Mitsubishi Motors Corp, the fourth car manufacturer in Australia, sold 55,215 vehicles in the year to November for a market share of 9.3 percent, down from 10.2 percent a year earlier when sales totalled 60,137.

The rest of the sales total was made up by imports, led by Hyundai Motor Co with sales of 46,103 vehicles making up 7.7 percent of the total. A year earlier the South Korean car maker sold 31,768 vehicles for a market share of 5.4 percent.
