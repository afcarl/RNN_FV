<p>Australian new vehicle sales rose one percent in the first 11 months of 1996 compared with a year earlier, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI) said on Friday.</p>
<p>Vehicles sales for the 11 months to November totalled 595,834, up from 589,653 a year earlier, the industry organisation said in its monthly VFACTS publication.</p>
<p>Sales in November fell to 55,368 from 55,805 in October and 55,526 a year earlier.  </p>
<p>&quot;With 0.8 of a selling day less in November versus October, this reduction translates to an increase in daily rate terms of 48.5 vehicles per day or 2.3 percent,&quot; the FCAI said.</p>
<p>The FCAI has forecast total Australian vehicle sales of 650,000, up 20,000 from 1995.</p>
<p>Passenger car sales to November totalled 451,041, up from 447,634 a year earlier, after sales of 41,229 in the month of November, down from 42,137 in November 1995.</p>
<p>Truck sales for the year to date total 144,793 compared with 142,019 a year earlier after November sales of 14,139, up from 13,389 a year earlier.  </p>
<p>Within the total truck sales, light truck sales totalled 130,959 for the year to November, up from 125,602 a year earlier, after sales of 12,761 in the month of November, up from 11,894 in November 1995.</p>
<p>Heavy truck sales amounted to 13,834 for the year to November, down from 16,417 a year earlier, after sales of 1,378 in November, down from 1,495 a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;The year-to-date 1996 market is now running ahead of the same period in 1995 by one percent or 6,181 vehicles,&quot; the FCAI said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The passenger market is up by 3,407 vehicles, or 0.8 percent,&quot; the FCAI said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is attributable to the continued strength of the small car segment, coupled with a solid, although weakening, performance in the upper medium car segment and to a lesser extent the luxury car segment and the people mover segment,&quot; the organisation said.</p>
<p>Among the vehicle manufacturers with plants in Australia, Ford Motor Co maintained its market lead in the year to date with sales of 120,913 for a market share of 20.3 percent but this was down from a year earlier when sales of 125,034  </p>
<p>represented a market share of 21.2 percent.</p>
<p>The market share of General Motors Co increased to 19.7 percent with sales of 117,177 vehicles, up from 115,245 a year earlier when its market share was 19.5 percent.</p>
<p>Toyota Motor Co sold 110,931 vehicles for an 18.6 percent share of the market.</p>
<p>In the year-earlier period, Toyota sold 111,007 vehicles, which represented a market share of 18.8 percent.  </p>
<p>Mitsubishi Motors Corp, the fourth car manufacturer in Australia, sold 55,215 vehicles in the year to November for a market share of 9.3 percent, down from 10.2 percent a year earlier when sales totalled 60,137.</p>
<p>The rest of the sales total was made up by imports, led by Hyundai Motor Co with sales of 46,103 vehicles making up 7.7 percent of the total. A year earlier the South Korean car maker sold 31,768 vehicles for a market share of 5.4 percent.</p>
