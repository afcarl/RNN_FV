NZ dollar closes lower, sentiment bearish.

WELLINGTON 1996-12-06

The New Zealand dollar kept its head above 70 U.S. cents at Friday's close after dipping below mid-afternoon but dealers said sentiment was ugly.

"It's  pretty bearish," said one dealer.

There were a combination of factors bearing down on the kiwi -- uncertainty about which parties will form the government, comments from Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash on Thursday that the kiwi was near the top of its cycle and international sentiment against dollar bloc currencies.  

The Kiwi was at US$0.7000/07 at 5.30 p.m. compared with its 0.7023/30 opening while the Trade-Weighted Index ended at 66.50 from its 66.83 opening.

Dollar currencies were being sold heavily after comments from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan about irrational exuberance in U.S. asset markets.

However, locally comments from Brash and uncertainty about which way NZ First leans when it choses a coaltion partner weighted most on the Kiwi.  

NZ First holds the balance of power and is in the final stages of decided between the caretaker National government and the left-leaning Labour Party.

Dealers said there was initial support for the kiwi at 0.6980 and then at 0.6950 but if that was breached then the floodgates would open.

Dealers said that which there had been some exporter interest to buy there was also hefty selling from big name U.S. traders.
