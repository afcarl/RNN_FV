RTRS-Australia bank inquiry restates independence.

SYDNEY 1996-12-06

The chairman of Australia's Financial System Inquiry, Stan Wallis, reiterated on Friday that the inquiry was independent of the Australian government, which set up the inquiry when it was elected in March.

"...I reiterate that this inquiry is being left free by the Treasurer to report entirely independently within its terms of reference," he said in a speech to a national savings seminar.

"Suggestions that the government or ministers already favour one view or another are not based on any indications received by the Inquiry," Wallis said in his first major speech after handing down a discussion paper on the inquiry last week.  

"...The inquiry is weighing up the submissions made to it according to the weight of evidence and arguement, tested by our own research and analysis, and not according to who made them," Wallis said at the seminar, jointly hosted by Life Investment and Superannuation Association of Australia (LISA) and the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA).

Wallis, the former managing director of paper and packaging group Amcor Ltd, siad the inquiry had no clear plan on potential banking mergers.  

"As regards mergers, as we have made clear in the Discussion Paper, the inquiry sees its task as recommending the best and most efficient regulatory framework for assessing merger proposals within the financial system," Wallis said.

"It will not assess any individual merger proposals or scenarios," he said.

He said the inquiry's committee members had not made up their minds on the options canvassed in the discussion paper.

"We also have no 'riding instructions' and we are unfettered as we begin the task of framing recommendations for the final report," he said.  

Wallis said the inquiry would not be able to make any recommendations on taxation in the financial services industry.

"Instead, comment on taxation matters in the Final Report will be confined to observations on their implications for the efficiency and competitiveness of the financial system."

He said globalisation, technological and financial innovation along with changing consumer needs and demand were all driving forces for change in the financial services area.

Wallis said the inquiry committee had no firm view on prudential regulation in the financial services industry.  

"Some submissions have presented a case for greater reliance on disclosure -- certainly the Treasury's submission is one of the more frequently reported of such submissions," he said.

"But Treasury, like most of those who made submissions, did not argue for diminution of prudential regulation at least for some time," Wallis said.

Analysts said the tone of the discussion paper last week reinforced widespread expectations that the inquiry's final report would recommend allowing bank mergers and new foreign investment in the banking industry.
