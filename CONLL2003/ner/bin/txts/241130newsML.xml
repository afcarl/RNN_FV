<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian hitman killed wrong victim.</title>
<headline>Australian hitman killed wrong victim.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>An Australian hitman who went to the wrong house and killed the wrong man was sentenced to 20 years jail on Friday.</p>
<p>Paul Crofts, 33, and an accomplice were contracted to shoot a man, identified only as Tony, in the leg to punish him for his misconduct with a female friend of the contractor, the New South Wales Supreme Court was told.</p>
<p>But in February 1993 Leszic Betcher, was shot and killed after answering a knock at the door of his Sydney home. &quot;The inference from all the material is that the marauders had come to the wrong house,&quot; Judge Michael Grove said.</p>
<p>In sentencing Crofts, who pleaded guilty, Grove took into account his &quot;mildly retarded&quot; intellectual state, which placed him in the lowest two percent of the population.</p>
<p>Grove said Betcher was &quot;not only the victim of a horrendous crime, but his death was brought about in circumstances of an equally ghastly error on the part of the prisoner and his accomplices&quot;. The unnamed accomplice was earlier sentenced to 20 years in prison.</p>
