RTRS-RBA rumoured buyer in Australian bond market.

SYDNEY 1996-12-06

The Reserve Bank of Australia was rumoured to have intervened to stop today's huge sell-off in the Australian bond market, traders said.

The central bank refused to comment.

"They were rumoured to have been in the market about a half an hour ago to stop the rot, but it's still looking a pretty horrible day," one trader said.  

By 3.20 p.m. (0420 GMT) the Australian 10-year bond futures contract was at 92.465 after hitting a low of 92.430, but was still down sharply from Thursday's 92.830 close.

This took the yield on the benchmark 10-year November 2006 bond to over 7.50 percent having been testing 7.0 percent earlier in the week.

A weak U.S. Treasury market, heavy technical driven liquidation and rising expectations for the country's growth performance next year all combined to push yields up sharply, analysts said.

This week's sell-off in the Australian dollar and an unchanged policy stance by the Reserve Bank also weighed on sentiment.
