NZ scientist cites progress in treating diabetes.

WELLINGTON 1996-12-06

A New Zealand scientist on Friday believes he has achieved a world-first in the treatment of diabetes using pig cells transplanted into two patients.

Professor Bob Elliott of the Auckland University School of Medicine hopes the treatment will eventually rule out altogether diabetes sufferers' need for insulin injections.

The patients are still producing insulin seven months after receiving the live pig cell transplants. However, they still need injections, as the cells produce only about a quarter of their insulin requirements.

"We could up that though, possibly to take the whole lot. In fact I'm sure we could, and that's what we'll be aiming for in the next round (of research)," Elliott told Reuters on Friday.

He said he was wary of negative side-effects and erred on the side of caution when planning the dose of cells the patients received, but is now confident he can inject more cells.

The insulin-producing cells are dotted around the pigs' main digestive gland, the pancreas. Encased in a gel-like substance which prevents them being destroyed, the cells are injected into the human abdominal cavity in a five-minute procedure.

"We're hoping they'll last for many years. Just how long we don't know, but it would be nice," Elliott said.

He said pigs were very "donor-friendly" for humans.

"They have a lot of similarities with humans in many ways. The amount of insulin they produce in response to a meal is about the same, and they are an omnivore like a human. There is a lot of information about pigs and their reactions in human systems," Elliott said.

He said pig insulin had been used in injections for 50 or 60 years.

The latest finding, evolved from research started 10 years ago, has been put on hold while a working party established by the Ministry of Health sets up guidelines for the use of animal tissues in transplantation. Elliott hopes this will be completed within six months.
