<p>A New Zealand scientist on Friday believes he has achieved a world-first in the treatment of diabetes using pig cells transplanted into two patients.</p>
<p>Professor Bob Elliott of the Auckland University School of Medicine hopes the treatment will eventually rule out altogether diabetes sufferers' need for insulin injections.</p>
<p>The patients are still producing insulin seven months after receiving the live pig cell transplants. However, they still need injections, as the cells produce only about a quarter of their insulin requirements.</p>
<p>&quot;We could up that though, possibly to take the whole lot. In fact I'm sure we could, and that's what we'll be aiming for in the next round (of research),&quot; Elliott told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>He said he was wary of negative side-effects and erred on the side of caution when planning the dose of cells the patients received, but is now confident he can inject more cells.</p>
<p>The insulin-producing cells are dotted around the pigs' main digestive gland, the pancreas. Encased in a gel-like substance which prevents them being destroyed, the cells are injected into the human abdominal cavity in a five-minute procedure.</p>
<p>&quot;We're hoping they'll last for many years. Just how long we don't know, but it would be nice,&quot; Elliott said.</p>
<p>He said pigs were very &quot;donor-friendly&quot; for humans.</p>
<p>&quot;They have a lot of similarities with humans in many ways. The amount of insulin they produce in response to a meal is about the same, and they are an omnivore like a human. There is a lot of information about pigs and their reactions in human systems,&quot; Elliott said.</p>
<p>He said pig insulin had been used in injections for 50 or 60 years.</p>
<p>The latest finding, evolved from research started 10 years ago, has been put on hold while a working party established by the Ministry of Health sets up guidelines for the use of animal tissues in transplantation. Elliott hopes this will be completed within six months.</p>
