<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Australian meat sector eyes Argentine threat.</title>

<p>Australia's traditional meat export markets were future targets for serious competition from Argentina, Uruguay and Southern Brazil, the Australian statutory authority the Meat Research Corp (MRC) said.</p>
<p>In a special report, MRC said the threat was posed by a rapid clean-up of foot and mouth disease in South America.</p>
<p>Increasing the size and speed of the threat was the possibility that the U.S. would accept product from herds classified as &quot;free with vaccination&quot;, MRC said.</p>
<p>This was currently under consideration by the U.S. government, it said.  </p>
<p>Japan is the Australian industry's largest market, followed by South Korea and then Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>No outbreaks of foot and mouth disease had occurred in the target eradication regions of South America in the past two years, while Uruguay had been &quot;free without vaccination&quot; for more than 18 months, it said.</p>
<p>Argentina was pushing for &quot;free with vaccination&quot; status, with a decision expected in December, while southern Brazil was likely to be given &quot;free without vaccination&quot; status within two years, MRC said.  </p>
<p>Uruguay was exporting beef to the U.S. and attained accreditation to export fresh meat to Canada on October 8 this year, but was still waiting for market entry approval from Mexican authorities, it said.</p>
<p>The timing of Argentina's entry to the world beef market would depend on U.S. laws currently being discussed, it said.</p>
<p>Uruguay, Argentina and the Rio Grande do Sul (southern Brazil) were threats to Australia's share of Pacific Rim markets over the medium term, with indications that South America's entry to Pacific Rim markets may be slow, MRC said.  </p>
<p>Cattle were being pushed to more marginal land because of higher world grain prices, while last year's drought had affected breeder numbers and weaning rates, it said.</p>
<p>Also, Japanese officials had not shown positive signals to South American exporters, it said.</p>
<p>The U.S. quota system, a conservative approach by the Japanese government and the fragility of the South American processing industry might also limit the speed of South American enrtry, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;But some of these factors are not expected to last in the long-term,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>Argentine officials were optimistic that the country would gain access to the U.S. market for chilled and frozen beef in March 1997, it said.</p>
<p>Figures presented with the report show that Argentina's cattle herd stood at 54.21 million head in 1996. Uruguay's herd was 10.28 million head while southern Brazil's herd was 13.76 million.</p>
<p>Official estimates put Australia's cattle herd at 23.6 million head in 1995, up 2.7 percent on the previous year.</p>
