CANBERRA 1996-12-06

The Australian government said on Friday it had asked the Industry Commission to report within nine months on arrangements to help the Australian textile, clothing and footwear (TCF) industries beyond 2000.

"The commission will consider how the Australian TCF industries will evolve within a world trading environment in the next decade and report on barriers facing Australian exports," Treasurer Peter Costello said in a statement.

It would also report on the scope for further industry development, emphasising improved productivity and workplace practices.
