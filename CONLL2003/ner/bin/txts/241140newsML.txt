RTRS-ABA to probe CanWest's Ten holding.

SYDNEY 1996-12-06

The Australian Broadcasting Authority, said on Friday it would investigate recent share transactions in television operator The Ten Group which it believed increased CanWest Global Communications Corp's economic interest in Ten.

Foreign companies are not allowed to control a commercial television licence under Australian law. Control is deemed to mean no more than 15 percent of voting shares.

Canwest has a 15 percent voting stake, but a 57.5 percent economic stake in Ten through non-voting shares.  

"The ABA is to further examine recent share transactions relating to The Ten Group to ascertain whether there is a breach in the Broadcasting Services Act on foreign ownership and control of commercial television licences," the industry regulator said.

"The transactions have had the effect of increasing Canadian company CanWest's 'economic interest' in Ten," it said.

"However, the ABA is investigating whether or not the increase in CanWest's 'economic interest' has changed its company interests in Ten or has placed it in a position to exercise control of Ten's licences."  

Last month Melbourne businessman Isi Liebler bought a 10 percent voting stake in Ten from John Singleton Advertising Ltd.

Leibler now has a 15 percent voting stake in TEN and a 7.5 percent economic interest.

Leibler said then he would not comment on whether the purchase of the Singleton stake had been financed by Selli Pty Ltd, a company described by Singleton as a nominee company of CanWest.
