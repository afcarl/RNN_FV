The National Property Trust said on Friday it had met its first objective in a NZ$9.0 million capital raising by placing up to 4.03 million units with institutional and professional investors.

The trust has a prospectus to issue up to 10 million units at 90 cents each and plans to list on the New Zealand Stock Exchange later this month. The issue is to fund the purchase of Hewlett Packard House in Wellington.
