RTRS-ColMut says court approves demutualisation.

MELBOURNE 1996-12-06

Life office Colonial Mutual said on Friday the Supreme Court of Victoria had approved its plan to end its 124-year-old mutual structure, allowing the group to list on the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges.

"Now the group has received formal endorsement for demutualisation, we are on a direct path to listing in the first half of next year," managing director Peter Smedley said.

The group plans to distribute A$1.3 billion in shares to its 538,000 members worldwide, and raise another A$550 million, as part of its demutualisation and listing.  

"Shares and options will now be allocated to Colonial's more than 700,000 shareholders worldwide," Smedley said in a statement. Colonial members would receive a minimum allocation of 225 shares and options. Each parcel of one share and one option was valued at A$2.57 as at September 1996, Smedley said.

He also said the group's A$350 million converting preference share issue was full subscribed and these shares would list on the Australian Stock Exchange on January 9, 1997.
