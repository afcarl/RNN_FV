RTRS-INTERVIEW-Normandy not eyeing Newcrest.

Normandy Mining Ltd said on Friday it was not interested in taking over Newcrest Mining Ltd, ruling it out as a contender in market speculation that a number of resource interests were eyeing its long-time rival.

"We have looked at it and we are not interested," Normandy executive chairman Robert Champion de Crespigny told Reuters when asked if Normandy was a potential bidder for Newcrest.  

De Crespigny said the A$2 billion move in the United States by Newmont Mining Corp for Sante Fe Pacific Gold was a further hint of a major shakeup pending in the gold industry, which could bring North American majors to Australia.

"I do think it means that all (Australian) companies, Normandy in particular, are obviously exposed to be taken over by the North Americans ... they trade at such bigger premiums," de Crespigny said in an interview.

He said speculation of a shakeup in the industry was helping to underpin the share prices of gold producers.  

"...Certainly it is a little bit brighter than it was a month ago," he said.

"It smells like there might be change in the wind, but that does not mean it will not drop dead later," he said.

De Crespigny said Normandy was performing "as we had hoped to" in the first half of 1996/97.

"If you get the zinc price up, we would have a great year," he said.  

Normandy earlier this year merged with associated companies Posgold Ltd and Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie Ltd, creating Australia's largest gold company with equity annual production of 1.5 million ounces of gold, reserves of 13.4 million ounces and resources of 26.3 million ounces.

It has not given a forecast for first full year earnings, but said the group would have reported total net profits of A$100 million if it had been merged for 1995/96, including its then 49 percent stake in NOrth Flinders Mines Ltd.

The merger also opened up Normandy's share register, with Newcrest the largest shareholder.  

"There is no doubt since we did the merger that we would be on any person's (takeover) list who is strong enough to do it," de Crespigny said.

It was difficult to say whether or not the company had been approached by a potential predator, he said.

"The short answer is you are never sure if you have been approached or not," he said, adding the company had obviously been studied in the last 12 months as Newcrest and former shareholder Minorco Ltd had marketed Normandy stock.  

He said Normandy's open share register was both a strength and a weakness, but its real strenth was its A$3 billion capitalisation which would require "reasonably deep pockets" from any potential buyer.

De Crespigny said Normandy had considered a move on Newcrest in the six months from March this year when the Newcrest stake had stymied Normandy's merger proposals. He rejected suggestions that Normandy could seek to asset strip Newcrest.  

"We have never done any negative business in our lives, never ever have we bought anything to stop, spoil, strip ... we are interested in building the company rather than that," he said.

De Crespigny said Normandy now held "a touch under 75 percent" of takeover target North Flinders, with its current offer open until December 18.

"We are reviewing whether we call it a day or not," he said.
