Wilson and Horton Ltd's recently-acquired radio connection was not intended to be synergistic with its publishing operations, Radio Network Chairman John Maasland said on Friday.

But there were "complementarities" between the two, said Maasland, who is also Chief Operating Officer of Wilson and Horton.

Radio Network earlier this year bought Radio New Zealand's commercial network. It has since bought Prospect Group, with 12 stations, and Independent Radio News, for NZ$40 million.  

Radio Network is owned by a consortium comprising Wilson and Horton, Australian Provincial Newspapers (APN) and U.S.-based Clear Channel Communications.

Ireland's Independent Newspapers owns 85 percent of Wilson and Horton and has a major stake in APN.

"Newspapers as a medium have probably found their level to a certain extent," Maasland said. "I don't think we're going to see enormous growth in circulation in the future.

"One has to have an interest in other media, now, if you are in the media business. Radio is a logical thing for us in New Zealand because there is such a deregulated operation," he said.  

Maasland did not see radio and the Wilson and Horton's flagship, The New Zealand Herald, as ever having great synergy.

"But I do see opportunities in the provincial centres where there is some synergy between a local radio station and a newspaper," he said.

"I think newspapers will always look for depth of background and this is really the way we are taking the Herald. That is something I don't believe either radio or television will ever do," he said.

Radio makes up something like 11 percent of the advertising market.  

"If you look at New Zealand, where in a deregulated market there are something like 160 radio stations, the fact that we can have some 50 radio stations, which account for something over 50 percent of the revenue stream, then that is a very strong revenue which we will see coming forward," he said.

Prospect was bought to strengthen Radio Network's position in Auckland and Hamilton.

Radio Network's Prospect purchase has been cleared by the anti-monopolies Commerce Commission, provided it divests some stations. -- Wellington Newsroom (64-4-4734746)
