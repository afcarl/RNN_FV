Circulation of the New Zealand Herald is picking up, Wilson and Horton Ltd Chief Operating Officer John Maasland said on Friday.

"What we have done is arrest that decline and it's now moving forward on an upward curve," Maasland told Reuters in an interview.

"We have crossed the downward line, so we have recaptured the loss up to the point where we are now moving forward."

Maasland estimated circulation had picked up by about 11,000 since last year.  

The Herald's average circulation was last surveyed at around 225,000, the country's largest.

"I would not think that we are much above that now in average terms. But in actual terms, when you look at the last few months compared with the last year, then we are above 11,000 now, so it's a good strong gain," Maasland said.

Wilson & Horton is 85 percent owned by Dublin-based Independent Newspapers.

Maasland said he was pleased with the reaction the Herald had received after a major revamp in August.  

The Herald's circulation had previously been declining, running against the trend of strong population growth in Auckland.

Increasing the weekend cover price to NZ$1.00 in November 1995 was a mistake, Maasland said.

"The paper was on a bit of a slide anyway. It was not really meeting the needs of the Auckland market and we were seeing quite a substantial decline in the rural areas.

"When we increased it to a dollar I think we shot ourselves rather heavily in the foot, which was probably not a bad idea ... we woke ourselves up," Maasland said.  

The result was a fairly steep drop in circulation.

"We believe we started to address that by the changes that we made. I think that with the change in editor, the change in the design and the change in the content I believe we are starting to see some improvement in the paper.

"It has not, by any means, reached its zenith, but the feeling within the company and the editorial team is that we have a lot of things to do," he said.

The re-build of the Herald was not over.

Maasland said the business pages will be completely revamped to become a section by around February or March.  

There would also be major changes to Saturday's Herald.

Maasland said appointment of Gavin Ellis as editor had drawn flak at the time, with commentators doubting the internal appointment would be enough to change the paper's staid image. "But he has done that."

The Herald had previously failed to address the changes that had occurred in Auckland.

"It had not realised that Auckland had grown, it had become a much more multicultural city, and it was still providing a paper for what was the older age group," he said.
