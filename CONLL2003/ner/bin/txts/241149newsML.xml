<p>Building materials group James Hardie Industries Ltd reported on Friday a first half net profit in line with expectations, but comments on the second half by the group is likely to see full year earnings forecasts trimmed.</p>
<p>James Hardie, 27.23 owned by New Zealand's Brierley Investments Ltd, reported a 12.1 percent fall in net profit before abnormals to A$27.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 1996, in line with analysts' forecasts.</p>
<p>But managing director Keith Barton said he expected the second half result to be significantly down on the first half.  </p>
<p>Analysts at the company's results briefing said Barton's comments on the second half meant that estimates for pre-abnormal net profit for the 1996/97 year would be trimmed back to around A$50 million from A$53-A$54 million.</p>
<p>They welcomed the company's statement that outlook for its U.S. businesses were very positive for the 1996/97 second half and into 1997/98.</p>
<p>&quot;In contrast, the outlook for Australian operations remains bleak in the short term,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>&quot;In view of the immediate prospects, the company maintains its previously stated position that profit for the full year will reflect a marked deterioration on last year's results,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth prospects for the following year remain very positive,&quot; James Hardie said.</p>
<p>Keith Barton said the first half downturn reflected a fall in earnings from Australian building products due to lower housing starts.  </p>
<p>&quot;Reduced activity in the housing sector had an adverse impact on both volumes and margins for the Australian building boards, windows and bathroom products businesses,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Continued strong performances from the fibre cement and gypsum businesses in the United States as well as solid performances from New Zealand had however helped the result.</p>
<p>&quot;U.S. fibre cement production sold out during the six months to September and we continue to ship significant volumes of product from Australian and New Zealand plants to satisfy demand,&quot; Barton said.  </p>
<p>Hardie had just increased U.S. fibre cement production capacity by more than 40 percent to 480 million square feet through the commissioning of a third line at Plant City in Florida.</p>
<p>However analysts said the market would not be worrying too much about 1996/97 results, which are widely expected to be down on the A$58.4 million pre-abnormal net profit reported in the year to March 31, 1996.</p>
<p>Barton said he expected a rebound in profit in the year to March 31, 1998, following an expected fall in profit in the 1996/97 year.  </p>
<p>&quot;I expect it to be higher, but it is too early to say if it will be significantly higher,&quot; Barton later told reporters.</p>
<p>Analysts forecast James Hardie to have pre-abnormal net profit earnings of about A$90 million in 1997/98.</p>
<p>Barton also revealed that the Sydney-based group was conducting a study of the European fibre cement market, but had made no decison to enter any European countries yet.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to have a look, it is a large market,&quot; Barton said. &quot;It is early days, we are just having a look to see if we can understand the market.&quot;  </p>
<p>Sales for the first half rose 2.7 percent to A$913.9 million, while the dividend remained unchanged at 6.5 cents per share.</p>
<p>At 1.10 p.m. (0210 GMT), James Hardie shares were six cents lower at A$3.40 in a weaker Australian sharemarket that has been hit by a slump in the local bond market.</p>
