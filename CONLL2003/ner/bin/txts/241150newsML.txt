RTRS-Australian tourism to exceed 4 million - govt.

CANBERRA 1996-12-06

Tourism to Australia is expected to exceed four million visitors in one year for the first time in 1996, Tourism Minister John Moore said on Friday.

The industry, already Australia's biggest foreign exchange earner after years of growth, had already shown strong growth in 1996 with figures for the first nine months showing a 12.6 percent annual rise, Moore said.  

"Visitor arrivals have quadrupled over the past 12 years, placing Australia among the fastest growing tourism destinations in the world," Moore said.

Visitor numbers were 3.7 million in 1995, compared to Australia's population of about 19 million.

"Every 18 additional visitors to Australia (are) estimated to generate one job, so the strong growth in inbound tourism throughout the year has provided a real filip to the country's employment prospects," the minister said.

About half of visitors to Australia come from Asia, particularly Japan. -- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730
