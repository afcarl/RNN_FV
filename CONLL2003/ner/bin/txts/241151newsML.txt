RTRS-Western Metals talks with Iscor lapse.

SYDNEY 1996-12-06

Base metals, gold and minerals explorer Western Metals Ltd said on Friday its negotiations to buy Iscor Ltd's Rosh Pinah zinc and lead mine in Namibia had broken down.

"Western Metals wishes to notify shareholders that the memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed between Western Metals and Iscor Ltd on July 4, 1996 with respect to Rosh Pinah has now lapsed," Western Metals said.

"Negotiations have taken longer than anticipated and during this time the circumstances of the parties have changed from those originally envisaged in the MOU," it said.  

"Whilst Western Metals has not closed the door to any further negotiations, it will be necessary to take account of the changes if they recommence," the company said.

Western Metals has Thailand's Padaeng Industry Plc as a major shareholder.

Western Metals said in July it would issue Iscor 50 million of its shares at 90 cents each, equivalent to 27 percent of its enlarged issued capital, as payment for the mine.

The mine delivers about 100,000 tonnes of zinc and lead concentrates annually to smelters in southern Africa and has a mine life of at least 10 years.
