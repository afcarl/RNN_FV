Wilson & Horton sees "solid" second half.

AUCKLAND 1996-12-06

Publisher Wilson and Horton has had a solid, but below budget, second half performance in the current calendar year, Chief Operating Officer John Maasland said on Friday.

"We've had a solid second half but nothing dramatic," Maasland told Reuters in an interview.

The company had not met budget "but certainly we've done very well against last year in a very tough climate," he said.

Wilson and Horton reported a NZ$18.2 million profit in the six months to June, which was flat on the corresponding period a year earlier.

Most newspapers in the Wilson & Horton stable had gone "pretty well" but retail advertising had been hit and was well behind last year's.

The New Zealand Herald flagship had maintained a strong classified advertising base, which had led to 160-page Saturday editions, 40 of those in real estate advertising. The Herald's circulation was also improving, he said.

Many of the the provincial newspapers had come out of a recessionary period and were looking stronger in the North Island regions of Hawkes Bay, the Bay of Plenty and Northland.  

Community newspapers were having a tough time, largely because of their dependence on a retail base.

Commercial printing was flat but the magazine division was profitable and improving.

Education publisher Shortland Publications had a strong year.

After 18 months of change at Wilson and Horton, one or two of the smaller smaller companies in the group still required attention, Maasland said.
