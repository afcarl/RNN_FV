<headline>Wilson &amp; Horton sees &quot;solid&quot; second half.</headline>

<p>Publisher Wilson and Horton has had a solid, but below budget, second half performance in the current calendar year, Chief Operating Officer John Maasland said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had a solid second half but nothing dramatic,&quot; Maasland told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>The company had not met budget &quot;but certainly we've done very well against last year in a very tough climate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Wilson and Horton reported a NZ$18.2 million profit in the six months to June, which was flat on the corresponding period a year earlier.</p>
<p>Most newspapers in the Wilson &amp; Horton stable had gone &quot;pretty well&quot; but retail advertising had been hit and was well behind last year's.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Herald flagship had maintained a strong classified advertising base, which had led to 160-page Saturday editions, 40 of those in real estate advertising. The Herald's circulation was also improving, he said.</p>
<p>Many of the the provincial newspapers had come out of a recessionary period and were looking stronger in the North Island regions of Hawkes Bay, the Bay of Plenty and Northland.  </p>
<p>Community newspapers were having a tough time, largely because of their dependence on a retail base.</p>
<p>Commercial printing was flat but the magazine division was profitable and improving.</p>
<p>Education publisher Shortland Publications had a strong year.</p>
<p>After 18 months of change at Wilson and Horton, one or two of the smaller smaller companies in the group still required attention, Maasland said.</p>
<p>Wilson and Horton is 85 percent owned by Independent Newspapers Plc. -- Wellington Newsroom (64-4-4734746)</p>
