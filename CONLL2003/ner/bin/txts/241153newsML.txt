RTRS-Highlands investor says won't sell.

PORT MORESBY 1996-12-06

Papua New Guinea's National Provident Fund Board (NPF) said it had no plans to accept the takeover bid for Highlands Gold Ltd by Canada's Placer Dome Inc at the current offer price.

"We believe that Placer Dome's bid for Highlands Gold at 75 cents a share completely undervalues the underlying assets of Highlands Gold," NPF managing director Robert Kaul told Reuters.

"Our position is we are not selling at that price," he said.

NPF said earlier its stake in Highlands had risen to 5.54 percent from 3.18 percent with the on-market puchase of 13.2 million shares.  

NPF is one of a number of PNG-based institutions on the Highlands share register, including Motor Vehicle Insurance Trust with just under two percent.

Highlands Gold shares were steady at 77 cents on Friday, but had traded as high as 79 cents with 1.55 million shares traded.
