RTRS-SFE wheat slows as seasonal lethargy strikes.

SYDNEY 1996-12-06

Interest in Australian wheat futures evaporated on Friday and brokers said that in the absence of major news the market was likely to remain quiet until mid-January.

Sydney Futures Exchange wheat scored a single trade with the January 1997 selling steady on A$158.50 a tonne.

Settlement price movements showed no clear direction.

Anyone interested in hedging would have done so weeks ago, Andrew Szonyi of Perth Commodities and Futures Brokers said.

Settlement prices could possibly edge up but major market movements were not expected now until mid-January, he said.
