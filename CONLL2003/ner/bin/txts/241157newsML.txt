NZ's Triumph to restructure, sees break-even H2.

WELLINGTON 1996-12-06

Triumph Industries Ltd said on Friday its result for the year to December 31 would be lower than previously indicated and it was undertaking a major reorganisation of its business units.

It said it expected to do little better than break-even in the second half of the year.  

Triumph, a computer distributor and sheet metal fabricator, reported NZ$1.14 million net profit in the half-year to June 30.

The company said it had appointed Trevor Gray Managing Director Group CEO from January 1.

All group distribution activities will be conducted through the Renaissance company, which will continue to be headed by Grey. Managing Director Mal Thompson will withdraw from a daily management role but remain on the board.  

The move was aimed at capturing cost savings and efficiency gains by integrating operations. It would entail some one-off costs, and the requirement continued for debtor provisioning as the reseller market remained under pressure.

"Directors are confident that a successful integration of these three separate distribution arms will see the emergence of a profitable and significant player in the New Zealand information technology market," the company said.
