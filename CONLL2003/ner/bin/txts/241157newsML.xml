<title>NEW ZEALAND: NZ's Triumph to restructure, sees break-even H2.</title>
<headline>NZ's Triumph to restructure, sees break-even H2.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Triumph Industries Ltd said on Friday its result for the year to December 31 would be lower than previously indicated and it was undertaking a major reorganisation of its business units.</p>
<p>It said it expected to do little better than break-even in the second half of the year.  </p>
<p>Triumph, a computer distributor and sheet metal fabricator, reported NZ$1.14 million net profit in the half-year to June 30.</p>
<p>The company said it had appointed Trevor Gray Managing Director Group CEO from January 1.</p>
<p>All group distribution activities will be conducted through the Renaissance company, which will continue to be headed by Grey. Managing Director Mal Thompson will withdraw from a daily management role but remain on the board.  </p>
<p>The move was aimed at capturing cost savings and efficiency gains by integrating operations. It would entail some one-off costs, and the requirement continued for debtor provisioning as the reseller market remained under pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;Directors are confident that a successful integration of these three separate distribution arms will see the emergence of a profitable and significant player in the New Zealand information technology market,&quot; the company said.</p>
