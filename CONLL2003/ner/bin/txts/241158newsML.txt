Bolger says large agenda to tackle with NZ First.

WELLINGTON 1996-12-06

New Zealand caretaker Prime Minister Jim Bolger, entering fresh coalition talks with nationalist New Zealand First, said on Friday the two parties still had quite a large agenda to tackle.

Bolger said his National Party would hold a caucus meeting of MPs on Monday to discuss the state of coalition negotiations.  

Asked if Friday afternoon's meeting between National and NZ First would be the last, Bolger said: It depends whether we complete the agenda today or not. It's a simple as that. We've got quite a large agenda for today. It's a big workload, let's see how it goes."

Bolger said he would "of course" have to take what was agreed with NZ First to his own caucus of MPs for their approval, and this would happen on Monday.  

Political parties are scrambling to complete a coalition deal before parliament meets next Thursday for the first time since October's general election. NZ First is negotiating coalition terms with both National and Labour.
