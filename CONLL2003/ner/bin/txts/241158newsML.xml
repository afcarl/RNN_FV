<p>New Zealand caretaker Prime Minister Jim Bolger, entering fresh coalition talks with nationalist New Zealand First, said on Friday the two parties still had quite a large agenda to tackle.</p>
<p>Bolger said his National Party would hold a caucus meeting of MPs on Monday to discuss the state of coalition negotiations.  </p>
<p>Asked if Friday afternoon's meeting between National and NZ First would be the last, Bolger said: It depends whether we complete the agenda today or not. It's a simple as that. We've got quite a large agenda for today. It's a big workload, let's see how it goes.&quot;</p>
<p>Bolger said he would &quot;of course&quot; have to take what was agreed with NZ First to his own caucus of MPs for their approval, and this would happen on Monday.  </p>
<p>Political parties are scrambling to complete a coalition deal before parliament meets next Thursday for the first time since October's general election. NZ First is negotiating coalition terms with both National and Labour.</p>
