RTRS-Hardie sees A$4 mln Firmandale costs.

SYDNEY 1996-12-06

Building materials manufacturer James Hardie Industries Ltd said on Friday it expects interest costs of around A$4.00 million per year arising from its exposure to Firmandale Investments Ltd.

"That is going to cost about maybe A$4 million per year or of that order," managing director Keith Barton told reporters after the company's half year results.

The exposure arises under third party guarantee given in connection with the funding of Firmandale's investment in American Endeavour Fund Ltd (AEF).  

Barton said he was unsure how long it would take to settle the legal action surrounding Firmandale. "It is going to take several years, it is not going to be resolved quickly."

Last month, James Hardie raised its after tax provision for its exposure to Firmandale by A$15.7 million to A$65 million.

This was due to a further decline in Firmandale's net asset value based on its final accounts for the year ended March 31, Hardie told the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).

Barton said Hardie would review its tax provision exposure to Firmandale when the investment firm reports its next accounts, which are due next week.  

James Hardie, which is 27.23 percent owned by New Zealand's Brierley Investments Ltd, reported a 12.1 percent fall in net profit before abnormals to A$27.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 1996.
