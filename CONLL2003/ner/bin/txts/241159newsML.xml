<p>Building materials manufacturer James Hardie Industries Ltd said on Friday it expects interest costs of around A$4.00 million per year arising from its exposure to Firmandale Investments Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;That is going to cost about maybe A$4 million per year or of that order,&quot; managing director Keith Barton told reporters after the company's half year results.</p>
<p>The exposure arises under third party guarantee given in connection with the funding of Firmandale's investment in American Endeavour Fund Ltd (AEF).  </p>
<p>Barton said he was unsure how long it would take to settle the legal action surrounding Firmandale. &quot;It is going to take several years, it is not going to be resolved quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>Last month, James Hardie raised its after tax provision for its exposure to Firmandale by A$15.7 million to A$65 million.</p>
<p>This was due to a further decline in Firmandale's net asset value based on its final accounts for the year ended March 31, Hardie told the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).</p>
<p>Barton said Hardie would review its tax provision exposure to Firmandale when the investment firm reports its next accounts, which are due next week.  </p>
<p>James Hardie, which is 27.23 percent owned by New Zealand's Brierley Investments Ltd, reported a 12.1 percent fall in net profit before abnormals to A$27.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 1996.</p>
