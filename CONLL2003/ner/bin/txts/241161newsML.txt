RTRS-NatFoods sees slight half yr growth.

SYDNEY 1996-12-06

National Foods Ltd said on Friday it expected only a slight improvement in profit in the first half of 1996/97 compared with the first half of last year.

"At this stage I don't see any significant improvement on our performance last year, but we are seeing some improvement," managing director Max Ould told Reuters.  

Ould described trading conditions as "tight".

National Foods had continued to maintain 7-8 percent growth in the revenue recorded in the first quarter, he said.

The company was benefiting from a full year contribution from the Yoplait business, some slight milk price increases and some juice price rises. "So at the revenue line we are chugging along all right, but it's not dropping through in the same manner to the bottom line," Ould said.

"We are ahead of last year but you would have to say its very moderate growth on the bottom line."  

Ould said some of the cost savings National Foods had anticipated from an earlier restructure of its operations were not coming through as quickly as anticipated.

National Foods reported a net profit of A$15.05 million in 1995/96, which was towards the lower end of expectations, but much higher than the A$10.77 million achieved in 1994/95.
