<p>National Foods Ltd said on Friday it expected only a slight improvement in profit in the first half of 1996/97 compared with the first half of last year.</p>
<p>&quot;At this stage I don't see any significant improvement on our performance last year, but we are seeing some improvement,&quot; managing director Max Ould told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Ould described trading conditions as &quot;tight&quot;.</p>
<p>National Foods had continued to maintain 7-8 percent growth in the revenue recorded in the first quarter, he said.</p>
<p>The company was benefiting from a full year contribution from the Yoplait business, some slight milk price increases and some juice price rises. &quot;So at the revenue line we are chugging along all right, but it's not dropping through in the same manner to the bottom line,&quot; Ould said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are ahead of last year but you would have to say its very moderate growth on the bottom line.&quot;  </p>
<p>Ould said some of the cost savings National Foods had anticipated from an earlier restructure of its operations were not coming through as quickly as anticipated.</p>
<p>National Foods reported a net profit of A$15.05 million in 1995/96, which was towards the lower end of expectations, but much higher than the A$10.77 million achieved in 1994/95.</p>
