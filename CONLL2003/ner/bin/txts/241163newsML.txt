PNG troops kill nine civilians - report.

SYDNEY 1996-12-06

Papua New Guinea troops killed nine civilians and wounded five others in a mortar attack on a village on the secessionst-racked island of Bougainville, an Australian newspaper and rebels reported on Friday.

The mortar attack on the Malapita village in rebel-held Bougainville occured last Thursday when villagers were gathering for morning prayers in church, The Australian newspaper's South Pacific correspondent in the nearby Solomon Islands reported.

The newspaper said witnesses evacuated to the Solomon's capital Honiara confirmed the attack and the deaths.

One of the injured, Kauvina Tom, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her thighs, told the newspaper the mortars were fired from the nearby army-controlled Buin Care (Refugee) Centre.

"We saw seven mortars come from the Buin Care Centre, but only two came through the roof of the church," Tom said.

The mortars exploded on the floor of the church in the middle of the congregation, she said.

"It was a surprise that the (PNG) defence force decided to attack us because we were in the church," Tom said.

The rebels' Bougainville Interim Government issued a statement in Sydney saying more than 20 civilians, including children, have been killed in the past two weeks by troops and government-backed resistance fighters on Bougainville.

The statement lists the names of the nine killed and five wounded at Malabita in south Bougainville.

It also said that in another attack, on December 1 in Mokakuru village in southwest Bougainville, troops killed 11 people, some as they slept, and injured another 11.

"We fear there could be more killed, but we are still trying to get more information," rebel government spokesman Moses Havini told Reuters in Sydney.

There was no immediate comment from Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) headquarters in the country's capital Port Moresby, 800 km (500 miles) southwest of Bougainville.

Francis Ona, rebel president of the interim government, said in a statement that Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan had totally lost control of his military on Bougainville.

An official inquiry into the assassination of Bougainville premier Theodore Miriung on October 12 implicated troops in the killing and called for the units responsible to be removed from the island.

"It seems that the PNGDF are trying to kill as many civilians as possible before they are withdrawn from Bougainville," Ona said.

"We now have an unruly bunch of undisciplined marauding killers that are making Bougainville their 'killing fields'."
