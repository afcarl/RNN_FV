<p>Papua New Guinea troops killed nine civilians and wounded five others in a mortar attack on a village on the secessionst-racked island of Bougainville, an Australian newspaper and rebels reported on Friday.</p>
<p>The mortar attack on the Malapita village in rebel-held Bougainville occured last Thursday when villagers were gathering for morning prayers in church, The Australian newspaper's South Pacific correspondent in the nearby Solomon Islands reported.</p>
<p>The newspaper said witnesses evacuated to the Solomon's capital Honiara confirmed the attack and the deaths.</p>
<p>One of the injured, Kauvina Tom, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her thighs, told the newspaper the mortars were fired from the nearby army-controlled Buin Care (Refugee) Centre.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw seven mortars come from the Buin Care Centre, but only two came through the roof of the church,&quot; Tom said.</p>
<p>The mortars exploded on the floor of the church in the middle of the congregation, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a surprise that the (PNG) defence force decided to attack us because we were in the church,&quot; Tom said.</p>
<p>The rebels' Bougainville Interim Government issued a statement in Sydney saying more than 20 civilians, including children, have been killed in the past two weeks by troops and government-backed resistance fighters on Bougainville.</p>
<p>The statement lists the names of the nine killed and five wounded at Malabita in south Bougainville.</p>
<p>It also said that in another attack, on December 1 in Mokakuru village in southwest Bougainville, troops killed 11 people, some as they slept, and injured another 11.</p>
<p>&quot;We fear there could be more killed, but we are still trying to get more information,&quot; rebel government spokesman Moses Havini told Reuters in Sydney.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) headquarters in the country's capital Port Moresby, 800 km (500 miles) southwest of Bougainville.</p>
<p>Francis Ona, rebel president of the interim government, said in a statement that Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan had totally lost control of his military on Bougainville.</p>
<p>An official inquiry into the assassination of Bougainville premier Theodore Miriung on October 12 implicated troops in the killing and called for the units responsible to be removed from the island.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that the PNGDF are trying to kill as many civilians as possible before they are withdrawn from Bougainville,&quot; Ona said.</p>
<p>&quot;We now have an unruly bunch of undisciplined marauding killers that are making Bougainville their 'killing fields'.&quot;</p>
