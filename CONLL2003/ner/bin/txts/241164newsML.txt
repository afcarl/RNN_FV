SYDNEY 1996-12-06

Australian building materials group James Hardie Industries Ltd said on Friday it was conducting a study of the European fibre cement market, but had made no decison to enter any European countries yet.

"We are going to have a look, it is a large market," managing director Keith Barton told reporters after the company's half year results briefing. "It is early days, we are just having a look to see if we can understand the market."

James Hardie is currently expanding its fibre cement operations in the United States, and has recently announced a fibre cement joint venture in Asia.
