<p>Australian parliamentarian John Langmore has formally resigned from his lower house seat, the office of House of Representatives speaker Bob Halverson said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Halverson announced that he had received today from Mr John Vance Langmore, a letter resigning his place as member of the House of Representatives for the electoral division of Fraser in the Australian Capital Territory,&quot; his office said in a statement.</p>
<p>Halverson was considering possible dates for the by-election, his office said.</p>
<p>Langmore, 57, announced in November that he intended to resign from parliament to take up a position as Australia's senior representative at the United Nations headquarters in New York.</p>
<p>He played an active role at the U.N. social development conference in Copenhagen last year and has co-authored articles with U.N. development programme officer Inge Kaul.</p>
<p>Langmore, a persistent campaigner for interventionist economic policy, has been Labor member for Fraser since 1984.</p>
<p>He was senior private secretary to the employment and industrial relations minister from 1983 to 1984 and was economic advisor to then treasurer Paul Keating in 1983.</p>
