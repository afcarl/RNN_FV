SYDNEY 1996-12-06

Australian wool prices steadied overall at sales this week in Newcastle, Adelaide and Launceston, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters said.

The eastern market indicator rose by four cents to 556 cents a kg clean, while the western market indicator remained unchanged at 784 cents a kg.

A total of 84,924 bales were offered, with a pass-in rate of 10.3 percent, although lower in comparison to the previous week, the number of bales finally offered was only 93 percent rostered quantity advised at the end of last week.  

"The market overall steadied for the week, due largely to the differentiated offerings at the three centres," the council said.

"Early in the week there was localised caution as buyers waited for a maket level to be established after the volatility of the previous week.

The movement of the Australian dollar also contibuted to movements in the wool market as the week progressed," the council said. In the futures market, a total of 201 contracts were traded in the 21 micron contract in the week ended December 5.  

Open interest increased by 33 contracts to close at 892.

Sales next week are in Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle with a total with a total of about 143,800 bales on offer.
