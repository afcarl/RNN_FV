RTRS-NAB to issue A$350 mln in CDs.

MELBOURNE 1996-12-06

National Australia Bank Ltd said on Friday it plans to issue A$350 million of transferable certificates of deposit (CDs) due April 15, 2000.  

The coupon is 6.75 percent payable semi-annually with settlement on December 11, the bank said.

The issue was priced at a spread of 18 basis points over the 7.0 percent government bond due April 2000.

This the first fixed rate domestic issue by a major bank since 1991, and represents a return to the Australian market for the National Australia Bank, a spokesman for the bank added.
