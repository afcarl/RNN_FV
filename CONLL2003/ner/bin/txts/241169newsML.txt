SYDNEY 1996-12-06

Food manufacturer National Foods Ltd said on Friday it would invest A$57 million in a new dairy plant in the state of Victoria.  

The greenfields fresh dairy plant would be located at Morwell in Victoria, the company said.

The plant would begin to supply fresh dairy products nationally from 1997.

The facility would bring significant efficiencies into the processing and distribution of these products, it said.

National Foods said it would also gain from increased production capacity and greater flexibility to supply new products to consumers.

A trading halt applied earlier today had been lifted, it added.  

Managing director Max Ould said in a statement the plant would restructure one of National Food's core businesses, with a view to ensuring long-term competitiveness.

National Foods markets its dairy products under the Yoplait, Fruche, YoGo and Farmers Union brands.

Ould said the new plant would fully replace the fresh dairy processing currently undertaken at Murray Bridge in South Australia and Taree in New South Wales.

Murray Bridge would continue to make quality cheeses and Taree would continue to receive milk for Sydney distribution.
