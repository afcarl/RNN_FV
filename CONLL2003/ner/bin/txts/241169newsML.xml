<p>Food manufacturer National Foods Ltd said on Friday it would invest A$57 million in a new dairy plant in the state of Victoria.  </p>
<p>The greenfields fresh dairy plant would be located at Morwell in Victoria, the company said.</p>
<p>The plant would begin to supply fresh dairy products nationally from 1997.</p>
<p>The facility would bring significant efficiencies into the processing and distribution of these products, it said.</p>
<p>National Foods said it would also gain from increased production capacity and greater flexibility to supply new products to consumers.</p>
<p>A trading halt applied earlier today had been lifted, it added.  </p>
<p>Managing director Max Ould said in a statement the plant would restructure one of National Food's core businesses, with a view to ensuring long-term competitiveness.</p>
<p>National Foods markets its dairy products under the Yoplait, Fruche, YoGo and Farmers Union brands.</p>
<p>Ould said the new plant would fully replace the fresh dairy processing currently undertaken at Murray Bridge in South Australia and Taree in New South Wales.</p>
<p>Murray Bridge would continue to make quality cheeses and Taree would continue to receive milk for Sydney distribution.</p>
