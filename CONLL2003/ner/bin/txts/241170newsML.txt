RTRS-Hardie sees 1997/98 profit lift.

SYDNEY 1996-12-06

James Hardie Industries Ltd said on Friday it expected a rebound in profit in the year to March 31, 1998, following an expected fall in profit in the 1996/97 year.

"I expect it to be higher, but it is too early to say if it will be significantly higher," managing director Keith Barton told reporters after the company's half-year results briefing.  

James Hardie reported a 12.1 percent fall in net profit before abnormals to A$27.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 1996, which was in line with analysts' forecasts.

However, Barton said earlier he expected Haride's second half profit to be significantly lower than the first half.

Analysts said at the briefing that Barton's comments on the second half meant that estimates for pre-abnormal net profit earnings for the 1996/97 year would be trimmed back to around A$50 million from around A$53-A$54 million.

Barton said at the briefing he expected the 1996/97 second half dividend to be fully franked.  

New Zealand's Brierley Investments Ltd owns 27.23 percent of James Hardie.

Barton said Brierley had been fully supportive of the company and had no plans to sell its stake.

At 11.30 a.m. (0030 GMT), James Hardie shares were steady at A$3.46.
