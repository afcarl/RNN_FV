TOKYO 1996-12-06

Residents of an island between Japan and South Korea recovered six bodies on Friday believed to be from a South Korean trawler that has been missing since late last month, the Japanese coastguard said.

The bodies of the six, wearing red life jackets inscribed with Korean script, were washed ashore on the west coast of Tsushima, an island in the Korea Straits, a coastguard spokesman said. Their identities were not known.

South Korea's maritime police notified the Japanese coastguard that the No. 908 Mok Hwa Ho, a 43-tonne trawler with a crew of 10, went missing in the area on November 30.

Its last known position was some 150 km (95 miles) west of Tsushima. The boat's home port was not available.
