* Peso closes at 26.299 to dollar vs 26.293

The Philippine peso weakened to 26.299 to the dollar against Thursday's close of 26.293 after the Central Bank adjusted its selling price to 26.299 from 26.297, traders said.

"It goes to show that Central Bank is willing to let the peso slide. The market, of course, was a little bit jittery to stay short because of the move," one trader from a foreign bank said.  

Active trading was noted with $161.8 million changing hands among banks, which was bigger than yesterday's $109.7 million turnover.

The trader said the low domestic interest rate had also prompted some foreign funds to shift out of the pesos, leading to heightened demand for dollars.

It was exacerbated with the usual weekend arbritrage play by local banks. Banks buy dollars on Friday, settlements of which are on Monday, and earn swap points for pesos held over the weekend.
