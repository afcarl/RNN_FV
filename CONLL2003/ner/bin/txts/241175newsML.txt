China, U.S. textile talks end with no deal.

BEIJING 1996-12-06

Chinese and U.S. negotiators have failed to resolve a multi-million dollar textile dispute after four days of talks in Beijing but have promised to resume discussions in the United States later this month.

A great deal remained to be resolved after the Beijing talks, which had aimed to reach a compromise on renewing bilateral textile agreements due to expire on December 31, the U.S. embassy in Beijing said in a statement.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said it was "looking forward to further talks with the U.S. side... and reaching agreement as soon as possible".

But the ministry declined to say if threatened curbs on imports of selected U.S. goods would go into effect as scheduled on December 10.

The United States last September slapped penalties worth $19 million on Chinese textiles, saying Beijing was shipping them through third countries to avoid quota restrictions.

China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks.

During the just concluded four-day talks in Beijing, Chinese trade officials and Washington's top textile negotiator Rita Hayes had also been wrangling over millions of dollars in penalties imposed by Washington on Chinese imports.

"Discussions were productive for both sides, but much work remains to be done," the U.S. embassy said of the talks which ended late on Thursday.

"The two delegations agreed to meet again later in the month in the United States to finalise their negotiations," it said but gave no details of whether the talks would be held before or after the Chinese deadline for retaliation.

China's huge textile sales to the United States have long been a sensitive point for U.S. trade negotiators eager to reduce Wasington's swelling trade deficit.

Washington said its 1995 trade deficit with China was $35 billion, making trade a major issue in ties already strained by disagreement over Taiwan, weapons sales, nuclear proliferation and copyright piracy.

Many Sino-U.S. trade negotiations have run up to, and sometimes beyond, deadlines for sanctions and punitive action, but trade conflict has usually been averted in the end.
