One day after announcing the biggest mass defection from North Korea, neighbouring South Korea said on Friday it would build its first camp next year to cope with a possible exodus from the communist nation.

Officials from the Unification Ministry, which deals with inter-Korean matters, said the camp would hold up to 500 people.

South Korea said on Thursday that 17 North Koreans -- 16 members of one family and a security guard -- fled through China to Hong Kong where they were waiting for asylum in South Korea.

It was the biggest-ever single flight from North Korea and set off alarm bells in Seoul that the North's deteriorating food and economic situation might soon become so dire that there would be a mass exodus.

Deputy Prime Minister Kwon O-kie, who is also national unification minister, told state radio that the government was fully prepared for any possibility, including an exodus and the collapse of North Korea. "There are many people who consider the sudden rise recently in the number of fleeing North Koreans as a prelude to the collapse of North Korea," he said in a telephone interview with the Korea Broadcasting System (KBS).

But Kwon cautioned against drawing parallels with East Germany at the time of the collapse of communism there when there was a flight of people to West Germany.

South Korea prefers that its rival make a "soft landing" from Pyongyang's present woes instead of a disintegration that would impose a major burden on the South's own economy.

South Korea has long had plans to cope with a North Korean exodus that included building camps, but it was the first time a construction date had been set.

Bills are before parliament at present to appropriate money for the project.

Under the plans, defectors would receive job training to prepare them for life in the South as well as food and shelter.

South and North Korea remain technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace pact.

About 600 North Korean defectors are now living in the South. In recent months, arrivals have been seen to rise as chronic food shortages bite into the lives of the population.

International relief agencies report peasants in the North are scrounging for tree bark, grass and edible roots in their search for food because of the failure of crops for two years running from heavy rain.

Park Hun-ok, a senior fellow at the private Institute of North Korean Studies, said he expected more North Koreans to flee the country as long the communist country faced economic difficulties and hunger.

"You may not see an immediate mass flight as North Korea will probably tighten security along the border with China, but there will be an increase of people trying to escape hardship and move to a better environment," he said.

"But this does not necessarily mean the collapse of communism in North Korea or disintegration of the whole country," Park told Reuters.

"There might be the collapse of (North Korean leader) Kim Jong-il's regime, but I don't think we will be able to see a repeat of the German situation in Korea in the foreseeable future," he said.
