PNG mortar attack kills nine civilians - report.

PORT MORESBY 1996-12-06

Papua New Guinea troops killed nine civilians and wounded five in a mortar attack that hit a church on the secessionist-racked island of Bougainville, an Australian newspaper and rebels said on Friday.

The attack on Malapita village in rebel-held Bougainville occured last Thursday when villagers were gathering in church for morning prayers, The Australian newspaper's South Pacific correspondent in the nearby Solomon Islands reported.

The newspaper said witnesses evacuated to the Solomons' capital Honiara confirmed the attack and the deaths.

One of the injured, Kauvina Tom, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her thighs, told the newspaper the mortars were fired from the nearby army-controlled Buin Care (Refugee) Centre.

"We saw seven mortars come from the Buin Care Centre, but only two came through the roof of the church," Tom said.

The mortar bombs exploded on the floor of the church in the middle of the congregation, she said.

"It was a surprise that the (PNG) defence force decided to attack us because we were in the church," Tom said.

The rebels' Bougainville Interim Government issued a statement in Sydney saying more than 20 civilians, including children, had been killed in the past two weeks by troops and government-backed resistance fighters on Bougainville.

The statement lists the names of the nine killed and five wounded at Malabita in south Bougainville.

It also said that on December 1 in Mokakuru village in southwest Bougainville, troops killed 11 people, some as they slept, and wounded 11.

"We fear there could be more killed, but we are still trying to get more information," rebel government spokesman Moses Havini told Reuters in Sydney.

Colonel Jack Tuat, chief-of-staff of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, told Reuters he was not aware of the Malapita attack.

"There have been no directions for special operations which would require the use of mortars," Tuat said in the capital of Port Moresby, 800 km (500 miles) southwest of Bougainville.

"The nearest army post is out of range of the church area. But we are trying to confirm with the field forces," Tuat said.

Francis Ona, rebel president of the interim government, said in a statement that Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan had totally lost control of his military on Bougainville.

"It seems that the PNGDF are trying to kill as many civilians as possible before they are withdrawn from Bougainville," Ona said.

"We now have an unruly bunch of undisciplined marauding killers that are making Bougainville their killing fields."

An official inquiry into the assassination of Bougainville premier Theodore Miriung on October 12 implicated seven soldiers and called for a troop withdrawal.

Tuat said a 30-man unit was being withdrawn from Bougainville. "The whole unit is being recalled, not just those implicated," he said.
