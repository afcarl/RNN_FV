<p>Papua New Guinea troops killed nine civilians and wounded five in a mortar attack that hit a church on the secessionist-racked island of Bougainville, an Australian newspaper and rebels said on Friday.</p>
<p>The attack on Malapita village in rebel-held Bougainville occured last Thursday when villagers were gathering in church for morning prayers, The Australian newspaper's South Pacific correspondent in the nearby Solomon Islands reported.</p>
<p>The newspaper said witnesses evacuated to the Solomons' capital Honiara confirmed the attack and the deaths.</p>
<p>One of the injured, Kauvina Tom, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her thighs, told the newspaper the mortars were fired from the nearby army-controlled Buin Care (Refugee) Centre.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw seven mortars come from the Buin Care Centre, but only two came through the roof of the church,&quot; Tom said.</p>
<p>The mortar bombs exploded on the floor of the church in the middle of the congregation, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a surprise that the (PNG) defence force decided to attack us because we were in the church,&quot; Tom said.</p>
<p>The rebels' Bougainville Interim Government issued a statement in Sydney saying more than 20 civilians, including children, had been killed in the past two weeks by troops and government-backed resistance fighters on Bougainville.</p>
<p>The statement lists the names of the nine killed and five wounded at Malabita in south Bougainville.</p>
<p>It also said that on December 1 in Mokakuru village in southwest Bougainville, troops killed 11 people, some as they slept, and wounded 11.</p>
<p>&quot;We fear there could be more killed, but we are still trying to get more information,&quot; rebel government spokesman Moses Havini told Reuters in Sydney.</p>
<p>Colonel Jack Tuat, chief-of-staff of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, told Reuters he was not aware of the Malapita attack.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been no directions for special operations which would require the use of mortars,&quot; Tuat said in the capital of Port Moresby, 800 km (500 miles) southwest of Bougainville.</p>
<p>&quot;The nearest army post is out of range of the church area. But we are trying to confirm with the field forces,&quot; Tuat said.</p>
<p>Francis Ona, rebel president of the interim government, said in a statement that Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan had totally lost control of his military on Bougainville.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that the PNGDF are trying to kill as many civilians as possible before they are withdrawn from Bougainville,&quot; Ona said.</p>
<p>&quot;We now have an unruly bunch of undisciplined marauding killers that are making Bougainville their killing fields.&quot;</p>
<p>An official inquiry into the assassination of Bougainville premier Theodore Miriung on October 12 implicated seven soldiers and called for a troop withdrawal.</p>
<p>Tuat said a 30-man unit was being withdrawn from Bougainville. &quot;The whole unit is being recalled, not just those implicated,&quot; he said.</p>
