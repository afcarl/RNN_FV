---------------------------------------------------------------

The September Euroyen futures contract ended Friday's Tokyo day session down, but off lows.

The September fell as low as 99.12 following a plunge in Japanese government bond (JGB) futures, but had managed to recoup some ot its losses by the end of the session. The volume was 88,458 contracts.

The key March JGB futures contract closed down 0.96 at 125.38 on a combination of bearish factors.  

JGBs were battered by a market rumour that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may stop buying JGBs from the secondary market.

The rumour was later denied by the BOJ, but March JGB futures had managed to erase only part of their losses.

Also, a slide in U.S. Treasuries and large-lot sales of the benchmark cash JGB by Asian investors accentuated the fall.

"Euroyen futures followed JGB futures down. The yield curve steepened as the long-end suffered the biggest loss," said a trader at a city bank.

"We may have already seen a big turnaround in market sentiment," he added.
