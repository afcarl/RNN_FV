Mudslide near Japan Olympic site, 14 missing.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Three construction workers were injured and 14 were missing in a mudslide on Friday at a mountain village in central Japan near one of 1998 Winter Olympics ski slopes, police said.

The mudslide at Otari village in Nagano prefecture, 230 km (138 miles) northwest of Tokyo, washed away a bridge and cut off access to a hamlet of about 30 people, police said.

The missing workers, including three women, were among a crew of about 50 who were restoring an embankment that had been damaged in a 1995 landslide when a flash flood swept tonnes of rocks and mud down a mountain stream, police said.

Police helicopters were being used in the search for survivors, police said.

Of 20 workers caught in the landslide, six were rescued, one of whom was seriously injured. Two sustained moderate injuries, police said.

The accident took place in a ski resort and hot spring spa area, a region of rugged mountains which is highly prone to landslides.

Otari is located 10 km (6 miles) from one of the main ski slopes to be used in the 1998 Winter Olympics at Nagano.

The landslide closed a national road linking the area with Japan's western coast, the second time in 14 months that the route was cut off.

The highway restoration project was not connected with ongoing preparations for the Winter Games, police said.
