Manila stocks finished in negative territory on Friday despite inching higher at the open as investors opted to take profits following a sharp runup the previous day, traders said.

"There was across-the-board profit taking as the market was able to break through its resistance level on Thursday," Teresa Lee, assistant vice-president Lippo Securities said.

Brokers said the new support was seen at 3,100 points.  

Traders said most issues led by blue chips such as San Miguel Corp which gained in the past few days took a breather on Friday.

Small cap issues like Philippine Realty and Holdings also succumbed to profit taking.

Except for the oil and financial sector, all other sectors fell. Losers outpaced gainers 74 to 41 with 64 shares unchanged.

The market is seen facing continued selling next week as the index will test a resistance level of 3,100 points.
