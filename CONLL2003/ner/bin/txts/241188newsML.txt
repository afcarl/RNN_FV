Japan telephone giant NTT to be split up.

TOKYO

Japan's telephone giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) will be broken up into three divisions under a single holding company, the government said Friday.

The decision to break up the telcoms company comes after more than a decade of debate over how Japan can best compete in the increasingly global telecommunications business.

"I'm happy that we reached an agreement which took into account the suggestions made by the ministry's panel," Posts and Telecommunications Minister Hisao Horinouchi told a news conference.

High rates and lack of innovation in Japan's telcoms sector have become an increasing worry to policymakers as innovations leap ahead elsewhere, leaving Japan behind in the crucial area.

NTT is now two-thirds owned by the government and dominates the domestic phone market with an 80 percent share of the business.

The plan will carve up NTT into two regional companies and a long-distance carrier. It will also be allowed to enter the international market for the first time.

NTT said in a statement that the timing of the break-up has not been determined yet and that more discussion with government officials was needed.

But it said it hoped to break into the lucrative international market soon.

"We hope to start international telephone business as soon as possible," a company official told Reuters.

One of the local firms will operate in western Japan and the other in eastern Japan, while the long-distance operator will offer international services.

The move is the latest in a series of break-ups and alliances in the global telecommunications business.

NTT has long fought to avoid break-up and the holding company scheme marks a compromise between NTT management and the government.
