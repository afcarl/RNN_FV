Manila flour firms to re-enter U.S. wheat market.

MANILA 1996-12-06

Philippine flour companies will probably be compelled to re-enter the wheat market next week because of their need for short covering this month, traders said on Friday.

"I expect the three firms which rejected all bids for 35,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat today to go back in the market next week," said one trader in a U.S. commodity house.

The firms rejected the bids because of high prices, traders involved in the negotiations said.  

"The offers for the U.S. wheat were too high. We are looking now at Canadian wheat as an alternative as prices are more reasonable," one of the traders said.

The trader said the bidders submitted an average price of US$191 per tonne FOB from the U.S. Pacific Northwest.

"The Canadian offer is cheaper by an average of $6 per tonne FOB," he added.

It was the second time this week that Philippine mills rejected U.S. wheat because of high prices.

"The three millers were the same group that rejected bids from U.S. wheat suppliers on Monday," another trader said.  

On Thursday, General Milling Corp bought 15,000 tonnes of dark northern spring wheat and 8,500 tonnes of western white wheat at an average price of $190 a tonne FOB U.S. Pacific Northwest for shipment in the second half of December.

The Trade and Industry Department said the price of a 25-kg bag of hard flour in Metro Manila was unchanged at 290 pesos while soft flour was also steady at 260 pesos.

The local corn and rice markets are expected to remain quiet due to ample supply.  

The state-run National Food Authority said the country's end-stock rice inventory reached 1.36 million tonnes as of the end of November, or 62 percent higher compared to the year-ago figure.

"The rice stock is good for 67 days based on a daily requirement of 20,500 tonnes nationwide," said NFA spokesman Vic Racho.

The country also has stocks of 418,000 tonnes of corn as of November 30 as against 453,000 tonnes in the same period in 1995.  

It has a corn requirement of 14,600 tonnes a day, mostly for animal feed, Racho said.

Two ships carrying 27,500 tonnes of U.S. corn each arrived in the past two weeks, boosting corn stocks, he said.

Four other vessels carrying a combined 107,499 tonnes of U.S. corn will arrive in the Philippines by the end of 1996.

Local prices of yellow corn went up this week, the NFA said. The farm-gate price of yellow corn reached 6.56 pesos a kg, against the previous week's 6.51 pesos while white corn was quoted at 6.47 pesos from last week's 6.41 pesos.  

The retail price of yellow corn was also up at 10.94 pesos a kg from the previous 10.74 pesos. The retail price of white corn was unchanged 11.08 pesos a kg.
