<p>Philippine flour companies will probably be compelled to re-enter the wheat market next week because of their need for short covering this month, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the three firms which rejected all bids for 35,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat today to go back in the market next week,&quot; said one trader in a U.S. commodity house.</p>
<p>The firms rejected the bids because of high prices, traders involved in the negotiations said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The offers for the U.S. wheat were too high. We are looking now at Canadian wheat as an alternative as prices are more reasonable,&quot; one of the traders said.</p>
<p>The trader said the bidders submitted an average price of US$191 per tonne FOB from the U.S. Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>&quot;The Canadian offer is cheaper by an average of $6 per tonne FOB,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>It was the second time this week that Philippine mills rejected U.S. wheat because of high prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The three millers were the same group that rejected bids from U.S. wheat suppliers on Monday,&quot; another trader said.  </p>
<p>On Thursday, General Milling Corp bought 15,000 tonnes of dark northern spring wheat and 8,500 tonnes of western white wheat at an average price of $190 a tonne FOB U.S. Pacific Northwest for shipment in the second half of December.</p>
<p>The Trade and Industry Department said the price of a 25-kg bag of hard flour in Metro Manila was unchanged at 290 pesos while soft flour was also steady at 260 pesos.</p>
<p>The local corn and rice markets are expected to remain quiet due to ample supply.  </p>
<p>The state-run National Food Authority said the country's end-stock rice inventory reached 1.36 million tonnes as of the end of November, or 62 percent higher compared to the year-ago figure.</p>
<p>&quot;The rice stock is good for 67 days based on a daily requirement of 20,500 tonnes nationwide,&quot; said NFA spokesman Vic Racho.</p>
<p>The country also has stocks of 418,000 tonnes of corn as of November 30 as against 453,000 tonnes in the same period in 1995.  </p>
<p>It has a corn requirement of 14,600 tonnes a day, mostly for animal feed, Racho said.</p>
<p>Two ships carrying 27,500 tonnes of U.S. corn each arrived in the past two weeks, boosting corn stocks, he said.</p>
<p>Four other vessels carrying a combined 107,499 tonnes of U.S. corn will arrive in the Philippines by the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Local prices of yellow corn went up this week, the NFA said. The farm-gate price of yellow corn reached 6.56 pesos a kg, against the previous week's 6.51 pesos while white corn was quoted at 6.47 pesos from last week's 6.41 pesos.  </p>
<p>The retail price of yellow corn was also up at 10.94 pesos a kg from the previous 10.74 pesos. The retail price of white corn was unchanged 11.08 pesos a kg.</p>
<p>US$1 = 26.20 pesos</p>
