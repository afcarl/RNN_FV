Singapore HSFO assessed steady amid dull interest.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

High sulphur fuel oil market was assessed steady amid lacklustre interests, in contrast to the distillate market, as traders were uncertain on near term market direction, traders said on Friday.

High sulphur 180-cst grade fuel oil was quoted at $121-$123 per tonne on Thursday.

"Traders are hedging on the mid term price direction," said a major.

"The swaps market and firm physical fundamentals will keep levels supported but most players are still vague on market direction," he added.

South Korean supplies were heard sold out. Traders said the country's supplies will continue to be limited as refiners run more low suphur light crudes to produce low sulphur fuel oil and distillates which is in demand for the winter.

Market activities late Friday were reduced to a trickle with some traders sidelined amid an uncertain market while others were away on holidays, traders said.

In the swaps market, December was up at $123/$124, a dollar higher from Thursday's quotes.
