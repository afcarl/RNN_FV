Malaysia rubber ends down on technical adjustment.

KUALA LUMPUR 1996-12-06

Malaysian rubber prices ended the week steady on technical adjustment after demand from overseas consumers remained weak, traders said.

They said business was slow as foreign buyers were either pitching for lower prices or distracted by the holiday mood.

At the close, the MRELB quoted January RSS1 buyer at 315.50 cents ($1.25) a kg, unchanged from Thursday. January SMR 20 buyer was also a half-cent higher at 303.50.

"There might be a slight rebound next week if there is some short-covering ahead of the holidays, which is usually the case," said a trader.  

He said the RSS 1 was expected to rise one cent through next week and the SMR20 between two and three cents.

"This is likely to happen, even if it's a technical adjustment," said the trader.

Trading houses offered the SMR CV at 362 cents, SMR L at 342, SMR 5 at 317, SMR 10 at 305, SMR 20 at 304 and drum latex at 235.

The INRO five-day moving average fell to 241.55 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kg on Dec 5 from 241.67 on Dec 4. The daily indicator price rose to 240.98 from 240.48.
