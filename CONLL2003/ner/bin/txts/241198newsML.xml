<p>Malaysian rubber prices ended the week steady on technical adjustment after demand from overseas consumers remained weak, traders said.</p>
<p>They said business was slow as foreign buyers were either pitching for lower prices or distracted by the holiday mood.</p>
<p>At the close, the MRELB quoted January RSS1 buyer at 315.50 cents ($1.25) a kg, unchanged from Thursday. January SMR 20 buyer was also a half-cent higher at 303.50.</p>
<p>&quot;There might be a slight rebound next week if there is some short-covering ahead of the holidays, which is usually the case,&quot; said a trader.  </p>
<p>He said the RSS 1 was expected to rise one cent through next week and the SMR20 between two and three cents.</p>
<p>&quot;This is likely to happen, even if it's a technical adjustment,&quot; said the trader.</p>
<p>Trading houses offered the SMR CV at 362 cents, SMR L at 342, SMR 5 at 317, SMR 10 at 305, SMR 20 at 304 and drum latex at 235.</p>
<p>The INRO five-day moving average fell to 241.55 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kg on Dec 5 from 241.67 on Dec 4. The daily indicator price rose to 240.98 from 240.48.</p>
