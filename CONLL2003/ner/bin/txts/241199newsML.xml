<title>PHILIPPINES: Manila shares do U-turn on cue from region.</title>

<p>Philippine stocks reversed an early rise on Friday and ended lower as the market took its cue from other bourses in the region which fell on comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, brokers said.</p>
<p>After opening up 12 points on selected buying of blue chips, sentiment suddenly changed.</p>
<p>The index ended down 23.88 points, or 0.75 percent, at 3,139.45, wiping out Thursday's 32-point gain.</p>
<p>&quot;We took our cue from other markets in the region like Hong Kong which reacted negatively to the news,&quot; said Felix Barrientos, a trader at ING Barings Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Our market was up at the open and then later the shares dropped. Without that comment, we would have ended in positive territory, continuing Thursday's gains.&quot;</p>
<p>Barrientos was referring to Greenspan's comment on Thursday that the U.S. central bank needed to be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infected stock and other asset markets as it could end up damaging the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Barrientos said the downtrend could continue next week depending on how the Dow Jones reacted to Greenspan's comments.</p>
<p>But some brokers said Greenspan's comments might have been an excuse for profit-taking in a market which was drifting in the absence of foreign funds which have been busy window dressing ahead of the year-end.</p>
<p>Noel Reyes, research head at Anscor Hagedorn Securities Inc said the market may have over-reacted to Greenspan's comments, but added the drop could continue next week as shares tested support at 3,100 points.</p>
<p>Barrientos said a drop in the Dow could possibly benefit Philippine shares. &quot;There is no telling exactly where these funds will go. You may have funds moving out of the U.S. market and shifting to the Asian region,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Philippine stocks have risen sharply over the past year, adding 587.88 points, or 23 percent, from 2,551.57 points 12 months ago.</p>
