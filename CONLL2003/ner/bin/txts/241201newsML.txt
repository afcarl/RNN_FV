Daewoo says it hasn't given up on Thomson.

South Korea's Daewoo Group, determined not to abandon its bid for French consumer-electronics company Thomson Multimedia, gathered top executives on Friday to discuss its next move.

"Of course we haven't abandoned our plan," Daewoo Group spokesman Lee Jung-seung said after the meeting. "Since this is not a rejection of privatisation, Daewoo will develop a policy based on its understanding of the situation and future developments."

Daewoo officials declined to say whether any conclusion had been reached on Thomson during the meeting.

On Wednesday, the French government backed away from its decision to privatise state-owned electronics giant Thomson SA after an independent privatisation commission challenged Daewoo's involvement.

Under the plan, France was to have sold loss-making Thomson to electronics group Lagardere for a symbolic one franc. Lagardere in turn planned to sell Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics Co Ltd, also for one franc.

The privatisation committee said in a report that the Daewoo deal did not fully reflect the value of Thomson's technology in digital decoders and flat screens.

"The French government suspended the process of privatising Thomson. We want to have concrete reasons why, especially in reference to Daewoo's bid," said Park Sung-il, spokesman for Daewoo Electronics.

While Daewoo officials described Friday's meeting as a "regular" gathering of affiliate presidents to mark the return of group chairman Kim Woo-choong from a trip to Malaysia, other sources said the Thomson situation topped the agenda.

The purchase of Thomson would have made Daewoo Electronics a major world player in electronics, transforming it from a struggling unknown into the world's biggest maker of televisions with established brand names and cutting-edge technology.

The South Korean government is backing Daewoo's bid and has called a meeting between Deputy Prime Minister Han Seung-soo and French Ambassador Dominque Perreau on Friday.

The ambassador was expected to say that the suspension of Thomson's privatisation did not rule out eventual participation by Daewoo in the privatisiation, a French Foreign Ministry official said in France on Thursday.

"It's going to become much more of a Korea-France thing than just between Thomson and Daewoo," said Bruce Gonyea, regional electronics analyst for Paribas Capital Markets in Singapore and a former Daewoo employee.

"Korean companies have power projects and construction projects in France, and the Korean government is in a good bargaining position," he said.

In 1995, France and South Korea enjoyed bilateral trade worth $3.42 billion, up from $2.8 billion the previous year, French Trade Commission figures showed.

The hiccup in Daewoo's plans could bode ill for French businesses in South Korea, industry sources said.

"I'm afraid there may be some bad impact," said Jean-Jacque Grauhar, director of the European Union Chamber of Commerce. "Some politicians are using very hard words toward France."

Others were more optimistic.

"I think the Korean government will be wise enough not to mix up things that should not be mixed up," said Jean-Claude Blanvillain, Seoul representative of Dassault Aviation. Dassault hopes to sell its Rafale fighter jets to South Korea.
