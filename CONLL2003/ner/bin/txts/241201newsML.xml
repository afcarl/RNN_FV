<p>South Korea's Daewoo Group, determined not to abandon its bid for French consumer-electronics company Thomson Multimedia, gathered top executives on Friday to discuss its next move.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we haven't abandoned our plan,&quot; Daewoo Group spokesman Lee Jung-seung said after the meeting. &quot;Since this is not a rejection of privatisation, Daewoo will develop a policy based on its understanding of the situation and future developments.&quot;</p>
<p>Daewoo officials declined to say whether any conclusion had been reached on Thomson during the meeting.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the French government backed away from its decision to privatise state-owned electronics giant Thomson SA after an independent privatisation commission challenged Daewoo's involvement.</p>
<p>Under the plan, France was to have sold loss-making Thomson to electronics group Lagardere for a symbolic one franc. Lagardere in turn planned to sell Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics Co Ltd, also for one franc.</p>
<p>The privatisation committee said in a report that the Daewoo deal did not fully reflect the value of Thomson's technology in digital decoders and flat screens.</p>
<p>&quot;The French government suspended the process of privatising Thomson. We want to have concrete reasons why, especially in reference to Daewoo's bid,&quot; said Park Sung-il, spokesman for Daewoo Electronics.</p>
<p>While Daewoo officials described Friday's meeting as a &quot;regular&quot; gathering of affiliate presidents to mark the return of group chairman Kim Woo-choong from a trip to Malaysia, other sources said the Thomson situation topped the agenda.</p>
<p>The purchase of Thomson would have made Daewoo Electronics a major world player in electronics, transforming it from a struggling unknown into the world's biggest maker of televisions with established brand names and cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p>The South Korean government is backing Daewoo's bid and has called a meeting between Deputy Prime Minister Han Seung-soo and French Ambassador Dominque Perreau on Friday.</p>
<p>The ambassador was expected to say that the suspension of Thomson's privatisation did not rule out eventual participation by Daewoo in the privatisiation, a French Foreign Ministry official said in France on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to become much more of a Korea-France thing than just between Thomson and Daewoo,&quot; said Bruce Gonyea, regional electronics analyst for Paribas Capital Markets in Singapore and a former Daewoo employee.</p>
<p>&quot;Korean companies have power projects and construction projects in France, and the Korean government is in a good bargaining position,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In 1995, France and South Korea enjoyed bilateral trade worth $3.42 billion, up from $2.8 billion the previous year, French Trade Commission figures showed.</p>
<p>The hiccup in Daewoo's plans could bode ill for French businesses in South Korea, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm afraid there may be some bad impact,&quot; said Jean-Jacque Grauhar, director of the European Union Chamber of Commerce. &quot;Some politicians are using very hard words toward France.&quot;</p>
<p>Others were more optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the Korean government will be wise enough not to mix up things that should not be mixed up,&quot; said Jean-Claude Blanvillain, Seoul representative of Dassault Aviation. Dassault hopes to sell its Rafale fighter jets to South Korea.</p>
