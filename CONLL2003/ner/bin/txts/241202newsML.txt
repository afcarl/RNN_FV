Indonesia late palm olein stable, interest dull.

JAKARTA 1996-12-06

Indonesian palm olein prices were mostly holding in late trading on Friday after edging up in the morning session, but buying interest was thin, traders said.

They said olein was quoted at 1,400-05 rupiah/kg in Jakarta. Crude palm oil was done at a tender in the North Sumatran city of Medan in two batches of 1,000 tonnes each.

The ex-factory price for the first, to be delivered on December 13 was done at 1,083 rupiah/kg. The second, to be delivered on December 20, was done at 1,077.28 rupiah.

"The tender prices are considered to be relatively high, and this helped lift olein prices," one trader said.  

Traders said they were also heartened by a statement by Beddu Amang, head of the state logistics agency BULOG, that olein prices should not exceed 1,500 rupiah/kg.

"We want the maximum price to be 1,500 rupiah until Ramadan," he told reporters, referring to the Moslem fasting month that begins in January.

He said that if palm olein prices dipped below 1,400 rupiah, producers and exporters would complain.

"This should be good news, particularly to those with long positions," one trader said. "It also seems to indicate that BULOG will not intervene in the market at current prices."
