<p>Indonesian palm olein prices were mostly holding in late trading on Friday after edging up in the morning session, but buying interest was thin, traders said.</p>
<p>They said olein was quoted at 1,400-05 rupiah/kg in Jakarta. Crude palm oil was done at a tender in the North Sumatran city of Medan in two batches of 1,000 tonnes each.</p>
<p>The ex-factory price for the first, to be delivered on December 13 was done at 1,083 rupiah/kg. The second, to be delivered on December 20, was done at 1,077.28 rupiah.</p>
<p>&quot;The tender prices are considered to be relatively high, and this helped lift olein prices,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Traders said they were also heartened by a statement by Beddu Amang, head of the state logistics agency BULOG, that olein prices should not exceed 1,500 rupiah/kg.</p>
<p>&quot;We want the maximum price to be 1,500 rupiah until Ramadan,&quot; he told reporters, referring to the Moslem fasting month that begins in January.</p>
<p>He said that if palm olein prices dipped below 1,400 rupiah, producers and exporters would complain.</p>
<p>&quot;This should be good news, particularly to those with long positions,&quot; one trader said. &quot;It also seems to indicate that BULOG will not intervene in the market at current prices.&quot;</p>
