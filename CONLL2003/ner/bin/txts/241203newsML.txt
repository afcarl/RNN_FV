Singapore rubber ends down, seen flat next week.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Rubber futures closed lower across the board on Friday despite some shortcovering for RSS1 rubber with the market seen drifting lower next week ahead of the Christmas holiday period, dealers said.

"We ran into some shortcovering for one sheet, but the buyers were dictating the price and it was sold pretty much at the level they wanted," a local rubber trader said.

Dealers said about 900 tonnes of the January RSS1 contract was sold along with 600 tonnes of the July/September contract.

"Action in the other rubber brands was also thin and flat, Japanese prices was not inspiring either," another trader said.  

Tokyo's benchmark May contract rose 0.4 yen to 142.4 while Kobe's May contract slipped 0.5 yen to 141.8.

"Most dealers are already thinking of the Christmas holidays. It's going to be difficult next week," one trader said.

At around 0945 GMT, January RSS3 was seen at 123.00-124.00 U.S. cents a kg from the previous 124.00 cents.

January RSS1 was seen at 175.00-176.00 Singapore cents (US$1.25-$1.26) a kg from the previous 176.75 cents. March TSR20 was seen at 174.00-175.00 Singapore cents (US$1.24-$1.25) a kg from 174.75 cents. (US$1-S$1.40) - Rene Pastor (65-870-3305)
