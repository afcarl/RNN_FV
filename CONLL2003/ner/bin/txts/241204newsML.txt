Donors pledge $2.4 billion to Vietnam for 1997.

HANOI 1996-12-06

Donor nations and agencies pledged aid totalling $2.4 billion to Vietnam for 1997, diplomatic sources said at the end of a two-day World Bank Consultative Group meeting in Hanoi on Friday.

The latest aid commitments, which were slightly more than the $2.3 billion pledged at last year's annual meeting in Paris, brought total pledges of official development assistance (ODA) since 1993 to $8.5 billion.  

Details of the pledges were expected to be formally announced at a World Bank news conference due later on Friday.

During the meeting donors praised the communist country's decade-old reform process, which has brought average economic growth of more than eight percent for the past five years and lifted living standards off the floor.

However, they also urged Hanoi to do more in a number of areas including trade liberalisation, state enterprise reform and in the creation of a more competitive economic environment.

The Communist Party agreed at a landmark meeting earlier this year to continue economic reforms, but conservatives have argued that the country's economic and social liberalisation could loosen the party's grip on power.
