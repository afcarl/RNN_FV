<p>Donor nations and agencies pledged aid totalling $2.4 billion to Vietnam for 1997, diplomatic sources said at the end of a two-day World Bank Consultative Group meeting in Hanoi on Friday.</p>
<p>The latest aid commitments, which were slightly more than the $2.3 billion pledged at last year's annual meeting in Paris, brought total pledges of official development assistance (ODA) since 1993 to $8.5 billion.  </p>
<p>Details of the pledges were expected to be formally announced at a World Bank news conference due later on Friday.</p>
<p>During the meeting donors praised the communist country's decade-old reform process, which has brought average economic growth of more than eight percent for the past five years and lifted living standards off the floor.</p>
<p>However, they also urged Hanoi to do more in a number of areas including trade liberalisation, state enterprise reform and in the creation of a more competitive economic environment.</p>
<p>The Communist Party agreed at a landmark meeting earlier this year to continue economic reforms, but conservatives have argued that the country's economic and social liberalisation could loosen the party's grip on power.</p>
