<title>THAILAND: Thai stocks close with pared losses.</title>
<headline>Thai stocks close with pared losses.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Thai stocks closed with pared losses on Friday as bargain hunters moved in to buy cheap stocks after much steeper losses were seen throughout the day, brokers said.</p>
<p>The SET index finished down 21.43 points to 876.89 on 5.3 billion baht turnover well above the day's low of 856.39.</p>
<p>It was the lowest close since June 14, 1993, when the index ended at 853.14.  </p>
<p>Earlier losses were posted as investors sold on concerns over the new Thai government's economic policies and remarks by US Fed chairman Alan Greenspan on inflation and rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors sold stocks across the board today following comments by Greenspan on Thursday. The comments caused the investors to worry that the U.S. would increase its interest rates which would then affect Thailand,&quot; said Thanadech Mahapokai of Book Club Finance and Securities.</p>
<p>Greenspan said the Federal Reserve must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stocks and other asset markets because that could end up doing damage to the economy.  </p>
<p>Every key sector fell across the board on Friday. The finance sector slipped most, declining 5.78 percent, followed by the chemicals and plastics sector, which fell 5.56 percent, and the energy sector, which was down 5.41 percent.</p>
<p>State-owned Krung Thai Bank topped the active list, falling two baht to 64.50. Siam Cement declined 24 baht to 808. Advanced Info Service gained four to 282 and Bangkok Bank rose six to 202.</p>
