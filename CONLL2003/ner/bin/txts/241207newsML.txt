Singapore government securities ended narrowly mixed in moderate trade on interbank and retail interest, dealers said on Friday.

"The interbank rate rose slightly today but there was little impact on the market as most people have squared their books for the weekend. Treasury bill yields were slightly higher but bond prices were slightly lower. Volume was moderate," a local dealer said.

In treasury bills, three-months closed at a yield of 2.40/2.35 percent compared with Thursday's yield of 2.27/2.22 percent.  

One-year closed at a yield of 2.50/2.45 percent against Thursday's 2.46/2.41 percent.

Among bonds, July 1998 ended at S$97.83/97.88 from Thursday's close of S$97.89/97.94, September 2001 at S$96.45/96.50 versus S$96.57/96.62 and June 2003 at S$94.45/94.50 against S$94.60/94.65.

The overnight interbank offered rate rose 3/16 percentage point to 3-5/8 3-1/2 percent from Thursday's 3-7/16 3-5/16 percent.
