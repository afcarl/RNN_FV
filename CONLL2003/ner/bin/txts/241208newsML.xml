<p>Singapore shares ended lower on Friday after a turbulent day which saw the key index fall 60 points at one stage after a heavy fall in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-share Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) closed at 2,190.39, down 23.78 points on a active volume of 206.33 million shares.</p>
<p>A total of 382 shares lost ground and only 48 rose.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything now depends on what happens on Wall Street and in London,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;If they follow through, we could see lower numbers on Monday. But any way you look at it, I believe this will be a correction and an opportunity to buy.&quot;</p>
<p>Unlike Hong Kong, New York and London, Singapore has fallen this year and consistently underperformed rival stock markets.</p>
<p>Dealers had expected Singapore to fall in a correction to recent gains, but the scale of Friday's rout was a surprise.</p>
<p>It was sparked by overnight Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan who spoke of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in stock markets and raised some worries over future inflation and rate trends.</p>
<p>Almost all Singapore's large capitalisation STII stocks fell, led by drinks firm Fraser &amp; Neave, which lost 40 cents to close at Singapore $15.10.</p>
<p>One of the few stable blue chips was Singapore Airlines foreign, which was flat at S$13.10 after Morgan Stanley recommended it as a core holding. The group gave SIA foreign a 12-month target of S$15.50.</p>
