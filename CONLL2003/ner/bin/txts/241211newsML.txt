GM reportedly plans Philippine investments.

MANILA 1996-12-06

Car giant General Motors Corp (GM) of the United States is planning to open several automotive-related projects in the Philippines, the Presidential Palace said on Friday.

"The American firm General Motors is investing in a variety of projects in the country to complement its car manufacturing plant in Thailand," the palace said in a statement.

The statement came after GM's Asian and Pacific operations president, Donald Sullivan, made a courtesy call on President Fidel Ramos on Friday.

"They are considering a lot of projects here, but the specific ones will come out (later). In a month's time, a final decision from the GM chairman might already be available," Philippine Board of Investments chief Cesar Bautista told reporters.

GM recently chose Thailand over the Philippines as the site of its multi-billion dollar car manufacturing plant for the Asia-Pacific region.
