<p>The South Korean stock market dipped below the key 700 point level on Friday in the latest sign that the economy of one of the most promising Asian &quot;Tigers&quot; might finally be running out of breath.</p>
<p>While most other Asian markets were falling because of anti-inflation comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, brokers in Seoul were firmly fixed on domestic woes.</p>
<p>&quot;At the start of the year, we expected the year-end market to be above 1,000. A sense of exhaustion prevails now,&quot; said Park Joo-chang, a broker at Daewoo Securities.</p>
<p>The composite stock index closed on Friday down 6.41 points at 699.89, the lowest since September 22, 1993, when the index finished at 697.56.</p>
<p>Brokers said sentiment had chilled rapidly in afternoon trading with the announcement of sales of state-run Korea Telecom shares.</p>
<p>Brokers had started the day buoyed by rumours that the government was considering delaying share sales of state-run firms and tax incentives for long-term stock investors.</p>
<p>But just after the morning close the Finance Ministry announced the exact opposite, saying the government planned to sell 6.92 million shares of Korea Telecom, valued at about 260 billion won, in an auction on December 12 and 13.</p>
<p>&quot;For investors who had anticipated boosting steps for the market by the government, it was like a slap in the face,&quot; said Kim Heung-shik of Hyundai Securities.</p>
<p>Brokers said the index could test the 650 level this month given plenty of negative factors, including fears of labour unrest and an overhang of loans for margin trading.</p>
<p>&quot;It may even be too optimistic to think that will be the bottom for this month,&quot; said Choo Hee-yup, a broker at Dongwon Securities.</p>
<p>Since Tuesday's announcement of labour reform plans, the first in 43 years, unions have stepped up their sabre-rattling, announcing plans for mainly token strikes over the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Unions object in particular to articles that open the way to worker layoffs and the introduction of flexible working hours, which would hit seasonal workers and overstaffed industries.</p>
<p>&quot;But among all the others, fears of an economic slump are the most serious reason for the market's weakness,&quot; said Lee Kye-joon, a broker at Daishin Securities.</p>
<p>The Bank of Korea, the central bank, said in November the country's annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed to a real 6.4 percent in the third quarter of this year from 9.8 percent a year earlier due to sluggish exports.</p>
<p>It also forecast GDP growth would slow to 6.4 percent for all of 1997 from an estimated growth of 6.9 percent this year and a 9.0 growth in 1995.</p>
<p>Plunging international prices for South Korea's major exports, including computer memory chips, steel and petrochemical products, slashed corporate profits.</p>
<p>The bank said the current account deficit would reach $22 billion this year, compared with a $8.95 shortfall in 1995.</p>
<p>Economists said companies and portfolio investors were cutting investment while individuals were reducing spending in the belief that the economy would slow further.</p>
<p>They said investors also were increasingly taking back their deposits from securities houses, further aggravating investor sentiment.</p>
