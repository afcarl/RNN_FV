Deputy Prime Minister Han Seung-soo told French Ambassador Dominique Perreau on Friday that France's decision to delay the privatisation of Thomson SA has "caused worries to many people," in South Korea, the domestic Yonhap news agency said.  

"It is true that this decision has caused worries to many people who want to expand economic cooperation between Korea and France," Han was quoted by Yonhap as saying during a late afternoon meeting.

"I hope this incident will not affect cooperative economic relations between the two countries. We will watch the steps and procedures the privatisation committee will take in the future," he added.

Yonhap said Ambassador Perreau told Han that France will keep the South Korean government informed of the steps it will take for Thomson's privatisation.

The privatisation will be carried out in a transparent fashion, Perreau was quoted as saying.
