SHANGHAI 1996-12-06

Shanghai B shares closed up sharply on Friday on good market sentiment, with overseas buyers concentrating on cheaper stocks and the index seen likely to exceed 70 points next week, brokers said.

The index rose 2.499 points or 3.89 percent to 66.690 points, on volume of 49.3 million shares worth $19.2 million. All 42 B shares traded, with 38 up, two flat and two down.

Brokers said that most investors bought B shares for long-term investment, which made the market move up steadily after Thursday's correction.

"Compared with the higher prices of A shares and rises in the Shenzhen B share market, Shanghai B shares have big upward potential," one broker said.

"The index is likely to breach the 70-point level next week in the absence of negative news," a second broker said.

Cheaper stocks priced between $0.400 to $0.600 which are expected to post reasonably good 1996 results were the focus of buying by overseas institutions, brokers said.

Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere was the star due to its plan to issue new B shares, initially seen as bad news but now seen as good because sentiment has turned bullish, brokers said.

It jumped $0.080 or 15.68 percent to $0.590, on volume of 2.6 million shares. Shanghai Lianhua Fibre traded the most, rising $0.014 or 8.97 percent to $0.170, on volume of 6.1 million shares.

Shanghai A share index consolidated down slightly on concerns about possible negative news over the weekend that the authorities would take measures to curb excessive speculation in the markets, brokers said.

The index fell 0.299 points or 0.02 percent to 1273.418 points, on volume of 1.3 billion shares worth 14.5 billion yuan.

The SSE 30 blue-chip index lost 16.915 points or 0.57 percent to 2958.061 points.

Wuxi Taiji was the biggest loser on institutional unwinding selling, down 0.47 yuan or 5.02 percent to 8.89 yuan, on volume of 7.0 million shares.
