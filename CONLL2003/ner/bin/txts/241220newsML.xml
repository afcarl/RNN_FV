<p>Shanghai B shares closed up sharply on Friday on good market sentiment, with overseas buyers concentrating on cheaper stocks and the index seen likely to exceed 70 points next week, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index rose 2.499 points or 3.89 percent to 66.690 points, on volume of 49.3 million shares worth $19.2 million. All 42 B shares traded, with 38 up, two flat and two down.</p>
<p>Brokers said that most investors bought B shares for long-term investment, which made the market move up steadily after Thursday's correction.</p>
<p>&quot;Compared with the higher prices of A shares and rises in the Shenzhen B share market, Shanghai B shares have big upward potential,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;The index is likely to breach the 70-point level next week in the absence of negative news,&quot; a second broker said.</p>
<p>Cheaper stocks priced between $0.400 to $0.600 which are expected to post reasonably good 1996 results were the focus of buying by overseas institutions, brokers said.</p>
<p>Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere was the star due to its plan to issue new B shares, initially seen as bad news but now seen as good because sentiment has turned bullish, brokers said.</p>
<p>It jumped $0.080 or 15.68 percent to $0.590, on volume of 2.6 million shares. Shanghai Lianhua Fibre traded the most, rising $0.014 or 8.97 percent to $0.170, on volume of 6.1 million shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai A share index consolidated down slightly on concerns about possible negative news over the weekend that the authorities would take measures to curb excessive speculation in the markets, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index fell 0.299 points or 0.02 percent to 1273.418 points, on volume of 1.3 billion shares worth 14.5 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The SSE 30 blue-chip index lost 16.915 points or 0.57 percent to 2958.061 points.</p>
<p>Wuxi Taiji was the biggest loser on institutional unwinding selling, down 0.47 yuan or 5.02 percent to 8.89 yuan, on volume of 7.0 million shares.</p>
