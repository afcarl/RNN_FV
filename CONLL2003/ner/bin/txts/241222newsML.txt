Indonesia sets 1,500 rupiah ceiling for palm olein.

JAKARTA 1996-12-06

The head of Indonesia's state logistics agency BULOG said on Friday domestic palm olein prices should not exceed 1,500 rupiah per kg.

"We want the maximum price to be 1,500 rupiah until Ramadan," he told reporters, referring to the Moslem fasting month that begins in January.

He said the ex-factory price of palm olein or crude palm oil-based cooking oil was now stable at 1,425 rupiah per kg. "This is a good level...not too high and not too low."

"It's good for the producer and normal for the consumer. If we can maintain this level, it will be good," he added.

He said that if palm olein prices dipped below 1,400 rupiah, producers and exporters would complain.

Amang said that the government's export tax on crude palm oil and three products would be maintained, adding that without the tax local palm olein prices could rise to 1,600 rupiah.
