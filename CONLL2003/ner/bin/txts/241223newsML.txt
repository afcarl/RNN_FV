Shanghai copper futures end down on selling.

SHANGHAI 1996-12-06

Shanghai copper futures ended sharply down on Friday on expectation of a decline in LME stockpiles to be announced tonight, traders said.

The most active March 1997 contract ended at an intra-day low of 20,250 yuan ($2,440) per tonne, losing 410 yuan. It opened at 20,400 and hit a high of 20,450.

December fell 230 to 20,260, January 400 to 20,250, February 470 to 20,200, April 400 to 20,260, May 380 to 20,280 and June 260 to 20,360.

Combined volume rose to 72,755 tonnes from 53,370.  

Copper opened lower and a large quantity of speculative selling pushed prices sharply down late in the session with most contracts closing at their intra-day lows.

Traders said many investors were worried the LME stockpile data would show an increase, resulting in panic selling.

"Speculative selling triggered panic selling from retail investors, which caused sharp falls late in the session," one trader said.

"Many investors focused on the LME stockpile data given the lack of other market-moving news," he added.  

"Copper will face heavy selling without the support of declining LME stockpiles," a second trader said.

"It will fall sharply if the key 20,000-yuan support level is breached in the next few days," he added.

Analysts expect copper to test the 20,000-yuan level in the next few days.

Aluminium ended down. December fell 10 to 13,840 yuan per tonne, January 50 to 14,000 and February 190 to 14,060.

Combined volume fell to 290 tonnes from 360.
