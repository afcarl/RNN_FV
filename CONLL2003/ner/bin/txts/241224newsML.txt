RESEARCH ALERT - Fraser says buy Armstrong.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Broking house Fraser Securities recommended on Friday a long-term buy on precision rubber components specialist Armstrong Industrial Corp Ltd, predicting expected net profit growth of more than 20 percent for fiscal 1997.

It said in a research report new factories in Indonesia, Malaysia, China and Thailand would help to boost earnings from the second half of 1996 onwards.  

"We project that the rapidly growing automotive industry in Thailand will provide strong impetus for (Armstrong's) growth there," it said.

"Contributions from Thailand are expected to increase 50 percent to reach about Singapore $11 million this financial year. This is expected to contribute 20 percent in profits."

The report said the stock's 1996 prospective price earnings ratio of 15.1 times supported the buy recommendation.

Fraser has projected Armstrong's net profit at S$6.8 million for 1997 and 1996 net profit of S$5.4 million. The company reported net profit of S$4.4 million in 1995.
