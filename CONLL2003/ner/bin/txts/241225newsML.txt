Manila firms reject bids for 35,000 T U.S. wheat.

MANILA 1996-12-06

Three Philippine firms rejected on Friday all bids for the supply of a total 35,000 tonnes U.S. wheat because of high prices, traders involved in the negotiations told Reuters.

"The offers for the U.S. wheat were too high. We are looking now at Canadian wheat as an alternative as prices are reasonable," one of the traders said.  

The trader said the bidders submitted an average price of $191 per tonne FOB from the U.S. Pacific Northwest port.

"The Canadian offer is cheaper by an average of $6 per tonne FOB," he added.

This is the second time this week that Philippine mills have rejected supply offers for U.S. wheat due to high prices.

"The three millers were the same group that rejected bids from U.S. wheat suppliers on Monday," another trader said.
