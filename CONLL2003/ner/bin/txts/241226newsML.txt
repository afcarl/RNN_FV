TOKYO 1996-12-06

Japan's vegetable oil production rose 1.5 percent in the January-October period from a year earlier to 1.417 million tonnes, the Agriculture Ministry said on Friday.

Higher domestic production was due to the impact the weaker yen had in helping to cut vegetable oil imports, said Koichi Toda, director of the Agriculture Ministry's Groceries, Oils and Fats division.  

Of the total vegetable oil output, rapeseed oil accounted for 674,000 tonnes, up by 5.3 percent from the same period of last year, but soybean oil was down by 1.3 percent at 550,000 tonnes, he said.

"The production cut of soybean oil was because lower feed demand pushed down soybean crushing," Tada said.
