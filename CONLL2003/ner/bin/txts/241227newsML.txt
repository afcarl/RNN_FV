KL blue chips sink amid regional bourse rout.

KUALA LUMPUR 1996-12-06

A rout in regional stock bourses and fears of sharp Wall Street losses on Friday sent Kuala Lumpur share prices spiralling lower, but blue chips recouped above their lows for the day.

The Composite Index shed 33.62 points or 2.74 percent to 1,191.32, after dropping to a 1,177.56 low for the session.

Small-capitalisation shares took a harder hit, dropping 22.97 points or 4.07 percent to 540.90.

A warning by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that "irrational exuberance" may be infecting stock and other markets, sent major regional bourses into a tailspin.  

"I think Wall Street will definitely follow (lower)," said Tony Shue, in institutional sales at Jupiter Securities. He said that if the drop on Wall Street tonight is drastic, "we will see a continued selloff (in Kuala Lumpur)" next week.

Volume was over 270 million shares, and losers trounced gainers by 652 to 38.

"There was quite a bit of blood spilled today," said an institutional dealer with a local brokerage firm. "It could be another bad day on Monday."

European bourses were already down following the Asian drops. Regionally, the Nikkei shed over three percent.
