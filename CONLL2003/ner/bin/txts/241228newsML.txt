China eyes overseas bourses for highway funds.

BEIJING 1996-12-06

China hopes to raise funds in overseas stock markets to help meet financing shortfalls for highway projects, the Xinhua news agency said on Friday.

"To issue shares on overseas stock markets is a new decision made by the Chinese government to replenish the short supply of funds needed for highway construction," Xinhua quoted Communications Ministry official Zhang Wensheng as saying.

China would need $65 billion for road construction over the next five years but expected a funding shortfall of 15-25 percent, Xinhua said.

About 10 percent of the total funds would be sought through foreign investment, Xinhua quoted Communications Minister Huang Zhendong as saying.

But foreign loans and direct overseas investment "are not likely to expand dramatically in the short run, so establishing new means of funding is an urgent task", Xinhua said.

The Anhui Expressway Co Ltd raised HK$872.6 million ($113 million) when it made its market debut on the Hong Kong bourse last month, it said.

"Anhui Expressway... has paved the way for other Chinese companies to seek funds to accommodate the highway construction boom," it said but gave no further details.
