Hong Kong gold ends sharply up on short-covering.

HONG KONG 1996-12-06

Hong Kong gold clawed its way up to end almost three U.S. dollars per ounce higher than New York's Thursday close on across-the-board short-covering, bullion traders said on Friday.

"First the Australian producers bid the market up, then the Japanese traders kicked in and finally Hong Kong dealers started short-covering," said the chief bullion dealer at a bank.

Bullion ended at US$374.10/60 an ounce on Friday against New York's US$371.10/40 close on Thursday.

Gold rose rapidly in the middle of the day and jumped another dollar during the afternoon session, gold dealers said.

"Every market maker is buying gold, you don't stand in the way of a running train," said one dealer at a European bank.

A sharp drop in the local stock market had partially fuelled buying, other Hong Kong traders said. "The stock market crashed and people bought gold," said one bullion trader.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped almost three percent to 13,102.73, as a resurgence in interest rate concerns pushed the blue-chip index down over 600 points at one stage in the day.

Stock investors were spooked after U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets.
