<title>HONG KONG: Hong Kong gold ends sharply up on short-covering.</title>
<headline>Hong Kong gold ends sharply up on short-covering.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Hong Kong gold clawed its way up to end almost three U.S. dollars per ounce higher than New York's Thursday close on across-the-board short-covering, bullion traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;First the Australian producers bid the market up, then the Japanese traders kicked in and finally Hong Kong dealers started short-covering,&quot; said the chief bullion dealer at a bank.</p>
<p>Bullion ended at US$374.10/60 an ounce on Friday against New York's US$371.10/40 close on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gold rose rapidly in the middle of the day and jumped another dollar during the afternoon session, gold dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Every market maker is buying gold, you don't stand in the way of a running train,&quot; said one dealer at a European bank.</p>
<p>A sharp drop in the local stock market had partially fuelled buying, other Hong Kong traders said. &quot;The stock market crashed and people bought gold,&quot; said one bullion trader.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped almost three percent to 13,102.73, as a resurgence in interest rate concerns pushed the blue-chip index down over 600 points at one stage in the day.</p>
<p>Stock investors were spooked after U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday the Fed must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stock and other asset markets.</p>
