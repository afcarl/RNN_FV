SHANGHAI 1996-12-06

Shanghai soybean futures ended mixed in slow trading on Friday with most investors attracted by the more active stock market, traders said.

The key January 1997 contract ended at an intra-day low of 3,194 yuan ($384) per tonne, losing eight yuan. It opened at a high of 3,200.

March fell five to 3,227, May rose 31 to 3,328, July rose one to 3,381, September dropped two to 3,380, November was down two to 3,398.

Combined volume fell to 10,900 tonnes from 14,500.  

Traders said most investors stayed on the sidelines and showed little interest in the dull soybean market.

"Many investors moved their money to the stock market and the remainder did not want to trade ahead of the weekend," one trader said.

"Soybeans will continue to move around the 3,200-yuan level in the next few days until fresh market-moving news emerges," he added.
