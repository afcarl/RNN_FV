<p>South Korean oil companies have no immediate need for Iraqi oil, due to start flowing any minute after the U.N gives the go-ahead, but they would remain on the alert for possible deals in the future, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't have plans to buy Iraqi crude right away,&quot; said a trader at a major South Korean refiner. &quot;But we are interested.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders in Seoul said they would remain on the sidelines for now, let others go first and see how the deal goes.</p>
<p>&quot;Most Korean refiners have locked up most of their term contracts for next year,&quot; said another trader. &quot;They'd prefer to wait and see and jump in later if the price is right.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the oil-for-food scheme, Iraq is allowed to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months in order to buy food and supplies for civilians suffering from sanctions imposed by the U.N. after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990. At current prices, exports are expected to be about 550,000 barrels per day (bpd).</p>
<p>Iraqi oil flows await final approval by U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in the form of a &quot;final report&quot; to be submitted to the security council.</p>
<p>Diplomats and U.N. officials expect the report in December, possibly around December 10-15.  </p>
<p>South Korean oil refiner Yukong Ltd used to have a long-term crude purchase agreement with the Iraqis before the Gulf War. The size of the deal was not immediatly available.</p>
<p>Official figures show South Korea imported 10 million barrels of crude oil from Iraq, out of a total 380 million barrels in 1990. Iraq was the 13th-biggest provider of oil to South Korea.</p>
<p>But some traders pointed out that Iraqi crude's high sulphur content and South Korean refiners' relations with Kuwait may slow the purchase.</p>
<p>Traders said Iraqi crude may not be very popular among South Korean refiners given the country's lack of desulphurising facilities and strong demand for lower sulphur crudes. Moreover, they would not want to offend Kuwait or any other crude suppliers in the Middle East by looking eager to deal with Iraq.</p>
<p>South Korean purchases of Iraqi crude would be mainly at the expense of Middle East crudes, including Kuwaiti, Iranian and Saudi Arabian oil, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want to upset our present suppliers in the Middle East, especially Kuwait. They have been good to us, and we'll have to be sensitive to their reaction,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>South Korea, which is entirely dependent on crude imports, relies on the Middle East for more than 75 percent of its imports. It has a total refining capacity of 2.22 million bpd.</p>
