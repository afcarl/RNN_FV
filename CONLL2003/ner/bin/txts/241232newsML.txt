Shanghai T-bill repo rates end mixed, spots up.

SHANGHAI 1996-12-06

Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mixed on Friday because big institutions returned money to the repo market due to the absence of new domestic A share issues, traders said.

The annual rate for the most active seven-day contract rose to 10.65 percent from 10.51 percent on Thursday.

Turnover plunged to 3.76 million lots from 7.84 million. One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.

There have been no new A share issues this week and some institutions returned their liquidity to the repo market, pushing down early-maturing contracts today, traders said.  

Traders expect the rates to recover early next week on the back of surging A share markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mostly up and traders said the rebound would continue early next week on bargain-hunting, with prices very low after successive falls in the past few months.

But the most active 10-year bond that matures in June 2006, a market barometer, fell to 116.47 yuan from 116.86 yuan, indicating market sentiment had not improved much, they said.

Combined volume of the nine-contract market rose to 2.45 million lots from 1.98 million.
