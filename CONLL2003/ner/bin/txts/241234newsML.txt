Taiwan dollar ends slightly firmer in active trade.

TAIPEI 1996-12-06

The Taiwan dollar reversed its early weakness to finish slightly firmer on Friday as the U.S. dollar weakened in Tokyo and elsewhere, dealers said.

The local unit slid slightly in early trade due in part to swap trading for the Asian Development Bank's Thursday issuance of T$7 billion Taiwan dollar-denominated bonds.

But the U.S. dollar's slide overseas pushed the local unit higher in afternoon trdae, dealers said.

The rate ended at T$27.491 after trading in a T$27.498-489 range, compared with Thursday's T$27.493 close.

Turnover through dealers was an active US$272 million.  

Dealers said they did not expect major movements in the exchange rate regardless of domestic or overseas factors.

"The central bank wants a stable exchange rate," said one dealer. "No matter what happend in Taiwan or in overseas markets, the movements won't be big."

A T$27.48-50 trading range was seen in the near term.
