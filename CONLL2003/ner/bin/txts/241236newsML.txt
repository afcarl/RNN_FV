Japan and Indonesia have agreed to increase military cooperation, the chairman of Japan's Joint Staff Council, General Shigeru Sugiyama, said on Friday.

"We will further increase the military relationship between Indonesia and Japan. It will bring a new era between the two countries," he told reporters after a meeting with Indonesia's President Suharto.

Sugiyama arrived in Jakarta on Thursday for a four-day visit.

Japan's military cooperation with Indonesia has been limited to the participation of Japanese naval vessels in joint exercises.

No further details on the military cooperation agreement were available.
