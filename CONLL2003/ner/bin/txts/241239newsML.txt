SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Singapore bunker indications on Friday were slightly higher on firm overnight spot quotes with some sellers seen offering on a floating basis, traders said.

Bunker 180-cst was quoted at $131 per tonne and 380-cst at $125 per tonne, marginally higher than Thursday's quotes.

Some sellers were seen offering base on a floating basis at $4-5 per tonne over Singapore spot quotes, ex-wharf, traders said. They said they were hedging on the mid-term market trends as current direction was uncertain.

MDO and gasoil prices have surged with firm cargo levels at $245-$250 and $254-$257, respectively.
