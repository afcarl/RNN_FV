Tokyo corn futures end mixed, distant months down.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Tokyo corn futures closed mixed on Friday, after the yen's gains against the dollar triggered selling from local investors, traders said.

Prices ranged from 140 yen lower to 310 yen higher, with the benchmark November 1997 contract down 60 yen to 13,580 yen per tonne. Daily volume was 89,177 lots.

A stronger Chicago corn market overnight encouraged local investor buying in the early morning, traders said. But the yen's gains against the dollar triggered selling later, pushing down most months, they said. "Position adjustment ahead of the weekend helped push down the prices," a brokerage trader said.  

The spot December contract on the CBOT Project A trading system was being traded at $2.68-1/2 per bushel at 0855 GMT, steady from Thursday's close.

The spot January contract of CBOT soybean futures on the overnight trading system was at $7.00 per bushel at 0855 GMT, against $7.02 at Thursday's close.
