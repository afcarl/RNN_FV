Kobe rubber futures mostly down in after-hours.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Kobe rubber futures were mostly weaker in extremely thin after-hours trade on Friday on scattered technical selling ahead of the weekend, traders said.

Prices ranged from 0.8 yen per kg lower to steady from the day's close. Benchmark May was down 0.5 yen at 141.8 yen.

During the day, prices were a tad firmer, backed by lower rubber stocks at the end of November, they said.

"Prices turned lower in after-hours trade. The impact of the stock falls was short-lived as that had already been factored into the market," an analyst at a commodity broker said. -- Tokyo Commodities Desk +81-3-3432-7431
