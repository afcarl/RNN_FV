HK stocks close with heavy losses on rate jitters.

HONG KONG 1996-12-06

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index posted its biggest point drop since March on Friday, as a resurgence in interest rate concerns sent the blue chip index tumbling more than 600 points at one stage during the day.

The Hang Seng closed down 388.83 points, or 2.88 percent, at 13,102.73, after skidding to a session low of 12,870.06.

Analysts said a selloff in the U.S. bond market and comments made by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan had prompted investors to take cover ahead of Friday's U.S. jobs report.

"The panic is payrolls tonight," said Alan Hutcheson director of research at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.

With the December 17 U.S. Federal Reserve policy setting meeting looming, analysts said investors had been spooked by remarks made by Greenspan in a speech on Thursday.

He said the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets. While U.S. inflation had been low recently, its future course was uncertain and the Fed had to be forward-looking in setting policy, he added.

Friday's Hang Seng decline was the biggest point loss since March 11 when the index fell 820.34 points, or 7.31 percent.

"People are discounting that the U.S. (Federal Reserve) may raise interest rates," said Alex Wong at Dharmala Securities.

But Wong, a technical analyst, said the morning selloff went too far. "The market was quite panicked in the morning and I think the selling was quite overdone."

The slump in stocks was accompanied by hefty turnover of HK$13.80 billion compared with HK$7.61 billion on Thursday.

Philip Niem, head of research at HSBC James Capel, said the decline showed how much trading money there was in the market.

"The traders have pushed it up and they have pushed it down. On the upside it went up too much and it is a sort of overreaction on the downside," he said.

Before the start of trade on Friday, the Hang Seng index had risen 20.90 percent since the end of August. The index fell 291.20 points, or 2.17 percent, this week.

Wong said the index could fall another 200 to 300 points but said the market should find support at 12,700 to 12,800 points.

Interest rate sensitive property and banking stocks saw the biggest decline on Friday. Henderson Land dropped HK$2.50 to HK$76.00 and HSBC Holdings slumped HK$4.00 to HK$158.00.

Mirabell International made its market debut on Friday and closed at HK$1.65 compared with an issue price of HK$1.22.
