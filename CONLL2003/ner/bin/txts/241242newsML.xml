<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng index posted its biggest point drop since March on Friday, as a resurgence in interest rate concerns sent the blue chip index tumbling more than 600 points at one stage during the day.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng closed down 388.83 points, or 2.88 percent, at 13,102.73, after skidding to a session low of 12,870.06.</p>
<p>Analysts said a selloff in the U.S. bond market and comments made by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan had prompted investors to take cover ahead of Friday's U.S. jobs report.</p>
<p>&quot;The panic is payrolls tonight,&quot; said Alan Hutcheson director of research at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>With the December 17 U.S. Federal Reserve policy setting meeting looming, analysts said investors had been spooked by remarks made by Greenspan in a speech on Thursday.</p>
<p>He said the Fed must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stock and other asset markets. While U.S. inflation had been low recently, its future course was uncertain and the Fed had to be forward-looking in setting policy, he added.</p>
<p>Friday's Hang Seng decline was the biggest point loss since March 11 when the index fell 820.34 points, or 7.31 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;People are discounting that the U.S. (Federal Reserve) may raise interest rates,&quot; said Alex Wong at Dharmala Securities.</p>
<p>But Wong, a technical analyst, said the morning selloff went too far. &quot;The market was quite panicked in the morning and I think the selling was quite overdone.&quot;</p>
<p>The slump in stocks was accompanied by hefty turnover of HK$13.80 billion compared with HK$7.61 billion on Thursday.</p>
<p>Philip Niem, head of research at HSBC James Capel, said the decline showed how much trading money there was in the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The traders have pushed it up and they have pushed it down. On the upside it went up too much and it is a sort of overreaction on the downside,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Before the start of trade on Friday, the Hang Seng index had risen 20.90 percent since the end of August. The index fell 291.20 points, or 2.17 percent, this week.</p>
<p>Wong said the index could fall another 200 to 300 points but said the market should find support at 12,700 to 12,800 points.</p>
<p>Interest rate sensitive property and banking stocks saw the biggest decline on Friday. Henderson Land dropped HK$2.50 to HK$76.00 and HSBC Holdings slumped HK$4.00 to HK$158.00.</p>
<p>Mirabell International made its market debut on Friday and closed at HK$1.65 compared with an issue price of HK$1.22.</p>
