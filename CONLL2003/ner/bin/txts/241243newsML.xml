<text>
<p>A group of Burmese students on Friday marched out of the Yangon Institute of Technology (YIT) in the northern outskirts of Rangoon and moved toward the University of Yangon about six km (four miles) away, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The witnesses could not give exact numbers of those taking part in the march or any other details immediately.  </p>
<p>On Monday and Tuesday, students from the YIT and the university launched street protests against what they called unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October.</p>
<p>The protests culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred of the student protesters being detained briefly by police near the central Shwe Dagon pagoda in Rangoon. They were later released.</p>
<p>On Friday, some students told Reuters that they were still dissatisfied with the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council's (SLORC) handling of their demands.</p>
<p>They said they wanted to organise independent unions on university campuses and demanded that details of the punishment of policemen who allegedly manhandled some students at the October brawl be published in newspapers.</p>
