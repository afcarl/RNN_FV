HONG KONG 1996-12-06

Shenzhen's B index continued its advance in active trading on Friday, with investors seeing B shares as cheap compared to their A share counterparts, brokers said.

The B index rose 8.54 points, or 4.96 percent, to end at 180.78, with turnover rising to HK$656.76 million from HK$506.51 million on Thursday. The index hit an intraday high of 183.11 and low of 173.40.

All 43 listed B shares were traded, with 41 gaining and two losing. Fresh money continued to flow in and boosted share prices, brokers said.  

Investors believe B share prices remained relatively low compared with their class A equivalents despite weeks of surges in the hard currency market, with B share technical charts still looking positive, brokers said.

The index should keep its upward momentum next week but also faces a likely technical correction, one analyst said.

Nanshan Power Station was the best performer, up HK$0.83 or 15.75 percent, to HK$6.10 on volume of 2.20 million shares.

Jiangling Motors rose HK$0.62, or 13.69 percent, to HK$5.15 on trade of 3.24 million shares, after announcing it would develop a new line of automobiles with Ford in 1997.  

China Bicycle, aided by institutional buying, rose HK$0.38 to HK$4.98 on the session's heaviest trade of 8.90 million shares.

Changan Automobile, the second most active counter, added HK$0.31 to HK$5.90, with 7.96 million shares changing hands.

Building materials maker Fangda fell HK$0.08 to HK$8.00 on volume of 1.69 million shares, on profit-taking, brokers said.

Guangdong Expressway fell HK$0.08 to HK$8.52 on thin trade of 405,100 shares.

The A share market edged up as institutional speculative buying targetted a range of cheap stocks, brokers said.  

The A index closed up 3.17 points, or 0.66 percent, at 480.52 on turnover of 14.78 billion yuan compared to Thursday's 14.18 billion. The composite index rose 3.95 points to 456.16.

Lumber processor Fujian Yongan Forestry Group Co Ltd, which listed 18.61 million A shares in Shenzhen on Friday, ended the session at 21.80 yuan against a recent offer price of 5.00 yuan per share.

Jiangling Motors climbed 1.01 yuan, or 11.61 percent, to 9.71 yuan.
