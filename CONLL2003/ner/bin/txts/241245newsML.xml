<p>Shenzhen's B index continued its advance in active trading on Friday, with investors seeing B shares as cheap compared to their A share counterparts, brokers said.</p>
<p>The B index rose 8.54 points, or 4.96 percent, to end at 180.78, with turnover rising to HK$656.76 million from HK$506.51 million on Thursday. The index hit an intraday high of 183.11 and low of 173.40.</p>
<p>All 43 listed B shares were traded, with 41 gaining and two losing. Fresh money continued to flow in and boosted share prices, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Investors believe B share prices remained relatively low compared with their class A equivalents despite weeks of surges in the hard currency market, with B share technical charts still looking positive, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index should keep its upward momentum next week but also faces a likely technical correction, one analyst said.</p>
<p>Nanshan Power Station was the best performer, up HK$0.83 or 15.75 percent, to HK$6.10 on volume of 2.20 million shares.</p>
<p>Jiangling Motors rose HK$0.62, or 13.69 percent, to HK$5.15 on trade of 3.24 million shares, after announcing it would develop a new line of automobiles with Ford in 1997.  </p>
<p>China Bicycle, aided by institutional buying, rose HK$0.38 to HK$4.98 on the session's heaviest trade of 8.90 million shares.</p>
<p>Changan Automobile, the second most active counter, added HK$0.31 to HK$5.90, with 7.96 million shares changing hands.</p>
<p>Building materials maker Fangda fell HK$0.08 to HK$8.00 on volume of 1.69 million shares, on profit-taking, brokers said.</p>
<p>Guangdong Expressway fell HK$0.08 to HK$8.52 on thin trade of 405,100 shares.</p>
<p>The A share market edged up as institutional speculative buying targetted a range of cheap stocks, brokers said.  </p>
<p>The A index closed up 3.17 points, or 0.66 percent, at 480.52 on turnover of 14.78 billion yuan compared to Thursday's 14.18 billion. The composite index rose 3.95 points to 456.16.</p>
<p>Lumber processor Fujian Yongan Forestry Group Co Ltd, which listed 18.61 million A shares in Shenzhen on Friday, ended the session at 21.80 yuan against a recent offer price of 5.00 yuan per share.</p>
<p>Jiangling Motors climbed 1.01 yuan, or 11.61 percent, to 9.71 yuan.</p>
