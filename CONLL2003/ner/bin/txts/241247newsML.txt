China congratulates Albright on appointment.

BEIJING 1996-12-06

China congratulated Madeleine Albright on Friday on her appointment as U.S. secretary of state and said it hoped she would help steer Sino-American ties on the path of further improvement.

"We congratulate Ms Albright on her nomination as secretary of state," a foreign ministry spokesman said.

"We hope that while she is secretary of state, China and the United States ... will grasp the opportunities and make mutual efforts to improve and develop Sino-U.S. ties."

U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday named Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, as his choice for secretary of state. Confirmation by the Senate is expected.

Sino-U.S. relations had been badly strained over the last two years by a host of issues from Taiwan to arms proliferation and trade.

But relations have improved markedly in recent months, most notably with a meeting between Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin in the Philippines last month.
