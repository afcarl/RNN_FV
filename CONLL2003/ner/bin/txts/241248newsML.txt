Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd and Barrick Gold Corp are to continue negotiations to hammer out a partnership agreement to develop the spectacular Busang gold find in Indonesia, sources close to the talks said on Friday.

"The negotiations will be held both in Toronto and in Jakarta," one source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.

Another source said most of the key negotiators from both Bre-X and Barrick had returned to Toronto, but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations.

Both sources said Bre-X and Barrick did not hold talks on Thursday with Mines and Energy Ministry Secretary-General Umar Said, who is coordinating the negotiations over the Busang find in East Kalimantan.

The first source also said Bre-X had until December 21 to submit to the Indonesian Mines and Energy Ministry a feasibility study on the central region of the Busang property, estimated to contain 2.6 million ounces of gold.

The richest parts of the property to the north and south of the central region have been estimated by Bre-X to contain 57 million ounces of gold.

"Bre-X is expected to complete the feasibility report by December 16 and submit it to the government before the December 21 deadline," the source said.

He said Bre-X would then formally seek the permission of the Indonesian government to begin construction to develop Busang's central region, which might take up to two years.

The source declined to say if there had been any progress in the talks between Bre-X and Barrick.
