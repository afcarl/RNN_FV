<p>Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd and Barrick Gold Corp are to continue negotiations to hammer out a partnership agreement to develop the spectacular Busang gold find in Indonesia, sources close to the talks said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The negotiations will be held both in Toronto and in Jakarta,&quot; one source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Another source said most of the key negotiators from both Bre-X and Barrick had returned to Toronto, but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations.</p>
<p>Both sources said Bre-X and Barrick did not hold talks on Thursday with Mines and Energy Ministry Secretary-General Umar Said, who is coordinating the negotiations over the Busang find in East Kalimantan.</p>
<p>The first source also said Bre-X had until December 21 to submit to the Indonesian Mines and Energy Ministry a feasibility study on the central region of the Busang property, estimated to contain 2.6 million ounces of gold.</p>
<p>The richest parts of the property to the north and south of the central region have been estimated by Bre-X to contain 57 million ounces of gold.</p>
<p>&quot;Bre-X is expected to complete the feasibility report by December 16 and submit it to the government before the December 21 deadline,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>He said Bre-X would then formally seek the permission of the Indonesian government to begin construction to develop Busang's central region, which might take up to two years.</p>
<p>The source declined to say if there had been any progress in the talks between Bre-X and Barrick.</p>
