JAKARTA 1996-12-06

The head of Indonesia's state logistics agency BULOG said on Friday the country's rice stock was currently at 2.3 million tonnes.

"Rice stock is around 2.3 million tonnes. It is more than enough. I hope stocks will be around 1.5 million tonnes by the end of next March," Beddu Amang told reporters.

"Some rice from Thailand will be coming soon from our counter-trade deal," he said, without giving details.

Under the deal, Indonesia will exchange two locally-made CN-235 passenger aircraft for 100,000 tonnes of Thai rice.
