Japan premium resurfacing after Hanwa Bank closure.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

The Japan premium -- the extra cost of funding for Japanese banks in the Euro interbank market -- has resurfaced after debt-laden Hanwa Bank Ltd was ordered to halt operations last month, bankers said on Friday.

The premium is higher for Japanese banks with below-average credit ratings, but even banks with comparatively good ratings are paying the cost, they said.

Smaller regional banks are estimated to be paying some 25 basis points (bps) above the prevailing one-month Eurodollar deposit rate of 5.53 percent. Major Japanese city banks with better credit ratings are paying a premium of 17 bps.  

The premium for major Japanese city banks with average credit ratings was close to zero before official word of the regional bank's debt problems, bankers said.

However, the premium has emerged again on Hanwa's problems and a prediction of more bank failures to come by a senior Bank of Japan (BOJ) official.

On November 21, Japanese authorities ordered Hanwa to halt its business -- the first time they have ordered a bank to shut in five decades.  

On November 25, Tadayo Honma, executive director at the Bank of Japan (BOJ), said more failures of Japanese financial institutions could not be ruled out.

Some bankers said the premium had dropped a bit from recent peaks because Japanese monetary authorities were likely to have provided dollars to banks with liquidity problems.

They said it was likely the authorities were making dollar-denominated deposits at such banks from the Government Special Foreign Exchange Account managed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), they said.  

Official assistance may have come after some banks with fund-raising problems in the Eurodollar deposit market finally tapped the currency forward market to raise dollars, bankers said.

The premium for Japanese banks soared to 100 bps in October last year following the collapse of a number of small financial institutions including Hyogo Bank  8532.T, as well as the disclosure of Daiwa Bank's massive losses in the U.S. Treasury market. -- Yoshiko Mori, Tokyo Treasury Desk +81-3-3432-8676
