<title>JAPAN: Japan premium resurfacing after Hanwa Bank closure.</title>

<p>The Japan premium -- the extra cost of funding for Japanese banks in the Euro interbank market -- has resurfaced after debt-laden Hanwa Bank Ltd was ordered to halt operations last month, bankers said on Friday.</p>
<p>The premium is higher for Japanese banks with below-average credit ratings, but even banks with comparatively good ratings are paying the cost, they said.</p>
<p>Smaller regional banks are estimated to be paying some 25 basis points (bps) above the prevailing one-month Eurodollar deposit rate of 5.53 percent. Major Japanese city banks with better credit ratings are paying a premium of 17 bps.  </p>
<p>The premium for major Japanese city banks with average credit ratings was close to zero before official word of the regional bank's debt problems, bankers said.</p>
<p>However, the premium has emerged again on Hanwa's problems and a prediction of more bank failures to come by a senior Bank of Japan (BOJ) official.</p>
<p>On November 21, Japanese authorities ordered Hanwa to halt its business -- the first time they have ordered a bank to shut in five decades.  </p>
<p>On November 25, Tadayo Honma, executive director at the Bank of Japan (BOJ), said more failures of Japanese financial institutions could not be ruled out.</p>
<p>Some bankers said the premium had dropped a bit from recent peaks because Japanese monetary authorities were likely to have provided dollars to banks with liquidity problems.</p>
<p>They said it was likely the authorities were making dollar-denominated deposits at such banks from the Government Special Foreign Exchange Account managed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), they said.  </p>
<p>Official assistance may have come after some banks with fund-raising problems in the Eurodollar deposit market finally tapped the currency forward market to raise dollars, bankers said.</p>
<p>The premium for Japanese banks soared to 100 bps in October last year following the collapse of a number of small financial institutions including Hyogo Bank  8532.T, as well as the disclosure of Daiwa Bank's massive losses in the U.S. Treasury market. -- Yoshiko Mori, Tokyo Treasury Desk +81-3-3432-8676</p>
