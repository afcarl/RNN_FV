Toyota to form customised car units.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it would set up three companies next year offering customised cars and car parts.

Toyota will form Toyota Modellista International Corp in Tokyo with its subsidiary Toyota Technocraft Co Ltd.

Toyota Modellista Fukuoka Corp will be set up in Fukuoka, western Japan, and Toyota Modellista Kobe Corp in Kobe with local Toyota dealers.

The market for customised cars has grown since laws dealing with such cars were deregulated in November 1995.

The new ventures will develop and procure parts and materials at home and overseas and will sell customised items to individual customers.

Toyota hopes to achieve first-year sales of 2.1 billion yen at Modellista International, 1.5 billion yen at the Kobe firm and 900 million yen at the Fukuoka firm in the first year.

It plans to set up 20 similar companies over the next five or six years.
