<p>Taiwan, seeking to control damage from Pretoria's planned diplomatic defection to Beijing, said on Friday that suspended projects in South Africa could still be restored.</p>
<p>&quot;Cooperation projects are suspended, not terminated,&quot; Taiwan's vice foreign minister, Cheng Chien-jen, told journalists in Taipei.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can reach an arrangement which both sides can accept, the projects can be restored immediately,&quot; Cheng said.</p>
<p>He did not elaborate on what kind of agreement he expected.</p>
<p>South African President Nelson Mandela announced on November 27 that Pretoria, the biggest of Taiwan's 30 diplomatic allies, would switch ties to Beijing in 1997.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister John Chang, who flew to South Africa earlier this week hoping to save the island's relationship with Pretoria, said on Thursday that Taipei would recall its ambassador and suspend all aid projects and treaties in protest at the breaking of diplomatic ties.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think our reaction is strong? This is what any sovereign country should do,&quot; Chang told reporters in Pretoria, broadcast on Taiwanese state-funded television.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't underestimate our reaction and don't make any mistaken judgment,&quot; Chang warned Pretoria.</p>
<p>Taiwan has said it hoped to maintain the highest level of relations with Pretoria after 1997.</p>
<p>The tie-switching announcement was a big blow to Taiwan, whose 29 other diplomatic allies are all under pressure from Beijing to switch allegiance to China.</p>
<p>Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province not entitled to international ties since the two were split in 1949 by a civil war.</p>
<p>Taiwan's hopes were dashed after Chang met Mandela, who said he would stick by his &quot;agonising&quot; decision to end diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</p>
<p>Taiwan is South Africa's seventh-largest trading partner with two-way trade totalling US$1.24 billion in 1995. Up to 43,000 jobs could be at risk if Taiwan pulled out entirely from South Africa, although analysts say this is unlikely.</p>
<p>Cash-flush Taiwan has said it will stop encouraging investment in South Africa and re-evaluate economic loans and aid.</p>
<p>Nearly 300 Taiwan businesses have operations in South Africa with total investment topping US$1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Tuntex Distinct Corp, one of Taiwan's major business groups, has said it will follow the government's wishes in deciding whether to continue a promised US$3.5 billion petrochemical project in South Africa.</p>
<p>A recent Taipei newspaper opinion poll showed that most Taiwanese don't recommend financial aid to reverse the shock diplomatic setback.</p>
<p>Taiwan, the world's 14th largest trading body, has used its powerful economic muscle to weave a strong trade network with many countries despite diplomatic isolation imposed by China.</p>
