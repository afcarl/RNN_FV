TOKYO 1996-12-06

State-owned National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) has raised its crude pricing formula for Iranian Light crude by five cents a barrel for January loading for Asian customers, traders in Tokyo said on Friday.  

Following the rise, Iranian Light for January loading will be priced at Oman's MPM plus eight cents, with an automatic adjustment factor added to that.

Iran kept the formula for Iranian Heavy unchanged at Dubai quotations minus three cents per barrel, with an automatic adjustment factor then subtracted.

Iranian crude prices are set on a quarterly basis. However, under a contract agreement, NIOC and customers can review prices whenever the market moves substantially.
