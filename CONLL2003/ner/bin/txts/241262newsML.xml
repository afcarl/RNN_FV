<headline>OPINION - Ivan Wong comments on Malaysian palm oil.</headline>
<text>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 6 - Partial data available indicate palm production in November was slightly less than previous expectations. Estimated at 764,000 tonnes, CPO output fell 120,000 tonnes or nearly 14 percent compared to October. The double-digit decline was evident in all producing states. The decline would have even larger had it not been for further improvement in the oil extraction rates. Compared to November last year, production grew at a modest pace of 2.8 percent. This is well below the growth rate of 9 percent registered in January-October.  </p>
<p>The slowdown in the growth rate is expected to continue for at least another month. Production may also be affected by the current rainy season. In line with the seasonel downtrend in production, CPO offtake fell around 50,000 tonnes to an estimated 760,000 tonnes in November. As expected, palm oil exports were estimated to have dropped to 655,000 tonnes from around 728,000 tonnes in October. Total stocks of palm oil at end November amounted to an estimated 965,000 tonnes or slightly more than the month ago level of 953,000 tonnes.  </p>
<p>Stocks of CPO alone are estimated at 605,000 tonnes or just about 5,000 tonnes higher than end October. The drop in palm oil exports of some 70,000 tonnes to around 655,000 tonnes in November reflected reduced offtake by three leading buyers, namely India, Pakistan and the European Union. The combined cutback of an estimated 95,000 tonnes more than offset increased offtake of some 40,000 tonnes by Islamic countries in West Asia. As the market fundamentels of palm oil had hardly changed in recent weeks, palm prices remained range-bound.  </p>
<p>February CPO futures eased five ringgit to 1,207 ringgit in the week ended November 29 after fluctuating between 1,236 ringgit and 1,205 ringgit. So far this week price moved narrowly between 1,214 ringgit and 1,188 ringgit and settled near the low of 1,194 ringgit yesterday. The barely steady undertone may also be attributed to weakness in the price of major competing oils, particularly soyaoil and rapeseed oil. With both soyoil and sunflowerseed oil competitively priced, the upside potential for palm oil in the near future is likely to be limited.  </p>
<p>This is nowithstanding the seasonal tendency for price of palm oil to move higher during the lean crop period in December- February.</p>
