Human rights in Cambodia deteriorating - report.

PHNOM PENH 1996-12-06

Cambodia is winding up its worst year for human rights since U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993, according to a Human Rights Watch/Asia report released on Friday.

In a report titled, "Cambodia: Deterioration of Human Rights", the group said political violence, torture, extrajudicial killings and interference with press freedom had all increased in 1996. It called upon the Cambodian government to take action to redress the worsening situation.

"Cambodia in 1993 was a success story of fair elections and a burgeoning civil society. Cambodia in 1996 has been a story of official intolerance, repression and narrowing political space," Sidney Jones, executive director of the group, said in a statement that accompanied the report.

Human Rights Watch/Asia said the royal amnesty granted in August to Khmer Rouge dissident Ieng Sary, who was foreign minister in the Maoist group's brutal 1975-1979 regime, "marks only the latest incident in a history of impunity for human rights abusers in Cambodia."

The report said there had been some modest successes this year, including human rights training for police and judges and the formation of a parliamentary commission on human rights, but expressed concern over increasing political violence and intimidation.

The report questioned whether local and national elections, scheduled for 1997 and 1998, could be free and fair. It also criticised efforts to intimidate the opposition Khmer Nation Party (KNP), including the murder of a KNP journalist in May.

Torture by police and the military was also singled out.

The report detailed cases in northwest Cambodia where civilians were arrested, accused of being Khmer Rouge agents and beaten severely. One man, Om Han, died during interrogation and another, Chhourn Theang, was shot and killed while being questioned by authorities, it said.

To reverse the slide in Cambodia's human rights situation, the report said the government should make it easier to prosecute those accused of human rights violations.

It also called on the international community to do its part to uphold human rights standards in Cambodia and urged the government of Japan, the leading source of aid for Cambodia, to press for human rights improvements.
