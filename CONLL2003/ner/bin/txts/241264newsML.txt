Malaysia Nov palm oil output seen down 14 pct - Wong.

KUALA LUMPUR 1996-12-06

Malaysia's palm oil output in November was estimated to have fallen by 14 percent to 764,000 tonnes over October, crop forecaster Ivan Wong said on Friday. He has previously projected a fall of 13 percent.

Wong estimated end-November palm oil stocks at 965,000 tonnes, compared with the Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority's (PORLA) 953,241 tonnes at end-October.

He said palm oil exports in November were forecast at 655,000 tonnes against PORLA's 727,629 tonnes in October.  

"The double-digit decline was evident in all producing states. The decline would have been even larger had it not been for further improvement in the oil extraction rates," Wong said in his latest report.

"The slow down in the growth rate is expected to continue for at least another month. Production may also be affected by the current rainy season."

Wong said the drop in exports in November reflected reduced offtake by three leading buyers, namely India, Pakistan and the European Union.  

"With both soyoil and sunflowerseed oil competitvely priced, the upside potential for palm oil in the near-future is likely to be limited," Wong said.

"This is nowithstanding the seasonal tendency for prices of palm oil to move higher during the lean crop period in December-February."
