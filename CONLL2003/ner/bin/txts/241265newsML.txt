Crudes steady in Asia, Minas firm on winter demand.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Crude oil prices were mostly quoted sideways in Asia on Friday. Some regional crudes including Minas inched up on the wet market, bolstered by firm demand for winter requirements, traders said.

Steady demand from China also served to lift indications for Minas, traders said.

January cash Brent was notionally assessed at $24.60/24.65, unchanged from late U.S. quotes. January SIMEX Brent futures were untraded at 0750 GMT, with the contract bid at $24.50 and offered at $24.75. The Brent/Dubai spread for February was $1.90/1.95, virtually unchanged from late U.S. levels.  

March Brent/Dubai was notionally assessed at $1.85/1.90.

In the wet market, light Gulf grades appeared firm.

A February Qatar Marine was believed to have exchanged hands at 50 cents above the official selling price. A Japanese trading company is believed to have sold the cargo to a Japanese refiner which has been conspicuously purchasing large amounts of Qatari crude for February lifting.

The level of the most recent deal was up five cents from the last deal done for February Qatar Marine.

Traders reported that a swap had been done between a major and a Japanese refiner for February Qatar Land and Murban.  

February Qatar Land was traded for a premium of 65 cents above the official selling price and February Murban for a premium of 75 cents above the official selling price.

A 200,000-barrel Oman for January lifting was sold by a European oil company. The buyers were widely believed to be China.

The premium for Minas was assessed firmer on the back of both winter requirements and demand from China. Some traders said the crude was fetching premiums of about 50 cents to 60 cents above the official selling price, up from 45 cents earlier this week. -- M.Yoshikawa/Tokyo +8-13-5473-3706
