<p>Malaysia's first light railway system (LRT) will open to passengers on December 16, a move which government officials hope will alleviate traffic on the capital's clogged streets.</p>
<p>The launch by operator Sistem Transit Aliran Ringan Sdn Bhd (Star) followed several aborted starts that officials blamed on teething problems. The system was originally slated to be launched in June of this year.</p>
<p>The first phase of the Star LRT system cost 1.27 billion ringgit ($504 million) and consists of 13 stations along a 12-km (7.4-mile) track within Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Many of the stations in the first phase run along and around Jalan Ampang, the city's main trunk road and which is traffic-clogged at most of the time.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to ensure the public gets a reliable, efficient, safe and predictable alternative transport to the existing limits of road travel,&quot; Star chairman Sallehuddin Mohamed told a news conference on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the Star-LRT system will help increase mobility and enable them to have greater control over their time and eventually help improve their quality of time,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But the country's opposition leader, Lim Kit Siang, said the system's fare structure was &quot;exorbitant&quot; and called on the government to intervene.</p>
<p>The cheapest fare between two stations in the 13-station system is 75 Malaysian cents ($0.30). The top fare is 2.95 ringgit ($1.17). This compares with 60 Malaysian cents ($0.23) for a mini-bus ride.</p>
<p>The polished metal trains with bright yellow doors will run at five-minute intervals and move 16,000 passengers an hour. The train frequency could be raised to three minutes if demand increases, Sallehuddin said.</p>
<p>The Star system is one of four different light rail systems planned by private operators to help alleviate Kuala Lumpur's traffic congestion.</p>
<p>Star, owned by a consortium of local and foreign investors, is building the second phase of its system at a cost of another 2.20 billion ringgit. The second phase is scheduled to be ready before the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur in September 1998.</p>
<p>Responding to a question about the fare structure, Sallehuddin said he was confident the public would prefer the LRT to driving their own vehicles because of the time saved.</p>
<p>&quot;If you know that the train provides convenience, predictability and reliability, I'm sure they will prefer to use it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Opposition leader Lim on Friday called on the government to make Star charge lower fares.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's crazy,&quot; Lim told Reuters of the fare structure. &quot;You might as well walk (to your destinations).&quot;</p>
<p>Star has also drawn flak from the disabled for not providing wheelchair access to its trains.</p>
<p>Sallehuddin said Star did not provide the facilities out of concern for the safety of wheelchair users in a busy station and to avoid possible delays in the system.</p>
