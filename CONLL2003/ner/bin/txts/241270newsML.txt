Tokyo naphtha soars, continues bull run.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Tokyo naphtha prices soared on Friday, with bullish sentiment fuelled by a tight physical market and a rise in crude prices overnight, traders said.

"A lot of buyers are in the market, but sellers cannot be sighted," a trader said.

First-half February open-spec naptha was assessed at $245.00/247.00, up sharply from Thursday's $237.00/238.50.

Second-half February was at $242.00/244.00 against $234.00/235.50 on Thursday. Spreads steepened reflecting strength in nearby months. The one-month spread from first-half February was assessed at plus $8.00/10.00.  

On Thursday, first-half February/first-half March was discussed at plus $6.00/7.00.

Most traders said prices were likely to continue an upward march with no bearish factors in sight. End-users are expected to emerge next week to cover second-half January cargoes, possibly fanning the market higher, they said.

Some traders cautioned that a tumble in crude prices would drag naphtha lower and that the run-up in prices this week seemed to have been overdone.

In the jet/kerosene market, Japanese buyers are sidelined waiting for the market to cool down, traders said.
