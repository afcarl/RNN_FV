SIMEX Nikkei nose-dives on Greenspan's comment.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

SIMEX Nikkei futures plummetted in hectic trade on Friday as rate hike fears resurfaced after comments overnight by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, dealers said.

In a speech to the Amercian Enterprise Institute, Greenspan said the Fed would not be concerned about a "collapsing financial asset bubble" if it did not hurt the U.S. economy.

The comment sent shockwaves throughout most Asian bourses, including Japan, after GLOBEX's December S&P 500 futures registered its biggest fall, of 12 points, since July to 733.35.  

SIMEX Nikkei December lost 725 points to end at 20,215. Turnover was a hefty 34,261 lots.

"Nikkei's collapse was triggered by Greenspan's comments, which refuelled fears of rate hikes," one dealer said.

"It then broke crucial technical support at 20,500 and fell further," he said. "I do not see any hope for the Nikkei at this point in time."

Dealers pegged the next crucial support for December Nikkei at 19,900, a level many felt could easily be tested next week.

Dealers said they were watching the U.S. payroll data, due later on Friday, for a clearer market direction.
