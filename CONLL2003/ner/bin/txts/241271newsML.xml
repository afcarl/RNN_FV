<p>SIMEX Nikkei futures plummetted in hectic trade on Friday as rate hike fears resurfaced after comments overnight by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, dealers said.</p>
<p>In a speech to the Amercian Enterprise Institute, Greenspan said the Fed would not be concerned about a &quot;collapsing financial asset bubble&quot; if it did not hurt the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>The comment sent shockwaves throughout most Asian bourses, including Japan, after GLOBEX's December S&amp;P 500 futures registered its biggest fall, of 12 points, since July to 733.35.  </p>
<p>SIMEX Nikkei December lost 725 points to end at 20,215. Turnover was a hefty 34,261 lots.</p>
<p>&quot;Nikkei's collapse was triggered by Greenspan's comments, which refuelled fears of rate hikes,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;It then broke crucial technical support at 20,500 and fell further,&quot; he said. &quot;I do not see any hope for the Nikkei at this point in time.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers pegged the next crucial support for December Nikkei at 19,900, a level many felt could easily be tested next week.</p>
<p>Dealers said they were watching the U.S. payroll data, due later on Friday, for a clearer market direction.</p>
