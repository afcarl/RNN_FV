HONG KONG 1996-12-06

Wharf (Holdings) Ltd's Wharf Cable TV on Friday signed a contract with Hollywood studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc's MGM Telecommunications Group to distribute MGM Gold films through Cable's movie channel.

"Starting from January 1 next year, MGM Gold's blockbuster movies will be shown on (channel) Cable Movie 1 in our basic package, four hours each evening, 365 days a year," Cable TV's chairman Stephen Ng said in a contract signing ceremony.

Ng declined to comment on the value of the deal.

MGM Gold is a joint venture between MGM Telecommunications Group and Encore International.

MGM movies started to make their television premiers on Cable TV's "pay-per-view" Cineplex channels in 1994 before extending to the basic movie channel.

"More local blockbuster movies will also make thier television debut on Cable Movie 1, which comes with Cable TV's basic packages," Ng said. Cable Movie 1 is a daily 24-hour channel of Cable TV providing film entertainment.

"We have chosen Hong Kong as the base of our MGM Gold operations in Asia," said Gary Marenzi, president of MGM Telecommunications Group.

"With the hand-over only a few short months away, our presence here in Hong Kong positions us right at the gateway to the China," Marenzi said.

MGM Gold has also reached distribution agreements in Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Indonesia. Major deals in Thailand and Philipines are expected to come up in the near future, Marenzi added.
