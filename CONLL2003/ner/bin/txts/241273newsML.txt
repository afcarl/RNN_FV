Ringgit up on dlr sell-off after Greenspan comment.

KUALA LUMPUR 1996-12-06

The ringgit battled against heavy technical resistance at 2.5180 as it gained on a dollar sell-off triggered by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments, dealers said on Friday.

They said the ringgit was just tracking the dollar/majors which had declined across the board in Tokyo afternoon trading.

"There is strong resistance at 2.5180. If that breaks, dollar/ringgit could go to 2.5150 and then to 2.5120," a dealer with a U.S. bank in Singapore said.

He said some profit-taking long ringgit/Singapore positions also limited the ringgit's gains.  

Greenspan said U.S. monetary policy should take into account developments in the treasuries market, where yields of long bonds have been falling.

Analysts said the falling yields in treasuries was causing a market-imposed monetary easing, which could trigger an overheating in the U.S. economy.

"Since September, U.S. monetary policy had been placed on a back burner.... However, the issue of U.S. rate hikes has now been firmly reinstated to the top of players agendas," research firm I.D.E.A. said in a comment.
