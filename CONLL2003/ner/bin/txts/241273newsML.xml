<p>The ringgit battled against heavy technical resistance at 2.5180 as it gained on a dollar sell-off triggered by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said the ringgit was just tracking the dollar/majors which had declined across the board in Tokyo afternoon trading.</p>
<p>&quot;There is strong resistance at 2.5180. If that breaks, dollar/ringgit could go to 2.5150 and then to 2.5120,&quot; a dealer with a U.S. bank in Singapore said.</p>
<p>He said some profit-taking long ringgit/Singapore positions also limited the ringgit's gains.  </p>
<p>Greenspan said U.S. monetary policy should take into account developments in the treasuries market, where yields of long bonds have been falling.</p>
<p>Analysts said the falling yields in treasuries was causing a market-imposed monetary easing, which could trigger an overheating in the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Since September, U.S. monetary policy had been placed on a back burner.... However, the issue of U.S. rate hikes has now been firmly reinstated to the top of players agendas,&quot; research firm I.D.E.A. said in a comment.</p>
