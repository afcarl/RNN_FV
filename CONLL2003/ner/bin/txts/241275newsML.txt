Asian stock markets slumped on Friday after anti-inflation comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sparked brisk selling across the region.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index led the falls, spiralling 569.90 points lower, a 4.22 percent fall, to close the morning session at 12,921.66. Turnover was huge at Hong Kong $7.78 billion (US$1 billion).

"The market was spooked by Greenspan's comments," said James Robertson, vice president at Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong. "There's not a buyer to be seen."

In a speech on Thursday, Greenspan said the Federal Reserve had to be wary of "irrational exuberance" infecting stock and other asset markets.

He added that while U.S. inflation had been low recently, its future course was uncertain and the Fed had to be forward-looking in setting policy, taking action before dangers developed.

The speech shocked investors in Tokyo, sending the Nikkei average plunging 667.20 points to close 3.19 percent lower at 20,276.70 in its biggest one-day decline this year. Brokers said heavy selling in futures led the charge.

"Since the Nikkei has hovered above 20,000 for some time, a break below that level would have an impact," said a broker at a major Japanese securities house.

Analysts said Asian markets were concerned that Greenspan's comments could cause a serious retracement on Wall Street when it opens later on Friday and were trying to pre-empt any such correction.

"Greenspan spoke after the American market closed so they are trying to double guess how far the American market is going to be down by," said Andrew Sekely, head of equities at brokers Intersuisse in Australia.

Australia's All Ordinaries index closed 69.4 points or 2.91 percent lower at 2,313.9, its single largest fall since March.

Under pressure from selling in neighbouring markets, Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) buckled 49.85 points, or 2.25 percent, to 2,164.32 at its lunchtime close. "It's following Hong Kong," said a dealer.

In Malaysia, blue chip stocks had dived nearly three percent at midday, tracking steep regional bourse declines and succumbing to profit-taking as investors locked in gains for the year, dealers said.

Thai stocks were also swamped by the Asian selling wave, sliding 4.35 percent to 859.20 at the lunch break.

In New Zealand, where the NZSE-40 Capital Index shed 31.08 points to close 1.3 percent lower, brokers said Greenspan's speech had been interpreted as a warning that equities were overvalued.

"This really is a very major sell-off," said one. "This is anticipating the jitters on Wall Street, a severe case of the jitters."

Seoul's composite stock index fell below the psychological 700-point level to 699.37 but brokers said the drop was due to disappointment over a South Korean government plan to sell Korea Telecom shares and not to Greenspan's comments.
