<p>Asian stock markets slumped on Friday after anti-inflation comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sparked brisk selling across the region.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index led the falls, spiralling 569.90 points lower, a 4.22 percent fall, to close the morning session at 12,921.66. Turnover was huge at Hong Kong $7.78 billion (US$1 billion).</p>
<p>&quot;The market was spooked by Greenspan's comments,&quot; said James Robertson, vice president at Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong. &quot;There's not a buyer to be seen.&quot;</p>
<p>In a speech on Thursday, Greenspan said the Federal Reserve had to be wary of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infecting stock and other asset markets.</p>
<p>He added that while U.S. inflation had been low recently, its future course was uncertain and the Fed had to be forward-looking in setting policy, taking action before dangers developed.</p>
<p>The speech shocked investors in Tokyo, sending the Nikkei average plunging 667.20 points to close 3.19 percent lower at 20,276.70 in its biggest one-day decline this year. Brokers said heavy selling in futures led the charge.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the Nikkei has hovered above 20,000 for some time, a break below that level would have an impact,&quot; said a broker at a major Japanese securities house.</p>
<p>Analysts said Asian markets were concerned that Greenspan's comments could cause a serious retracement on Wall Street when it opens later on Friday and were trying to pre-empt any such correction.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan spoke after the American market closed so they are trying to double guess how far the American market is going to be down by,&quot; said Andrew Sekely, head of equities at brokers Intersuisse in Australia.</p>
<p>Australia's All Ordinaries index closed 69.4 points or 2.91 percent lower at 2,313.9, its single largest fall since March.</p>
<p>Under pressure from selling in neighbouring markets, Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) buckled 49.85 points, or 2.25 percent, to 2,164.32 at its lunchtime close. &quot;It's following Hong Kong,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, blue chip stocks had dived nearly three percent at midday, tracking steep regional bourse declines and succumbing to profit-taking as investors locked in gains for the year, dealers said.</p>
<p>Thai stocks were also swamped by the Asian selling wave, sliding 4.35 percent to 859.20 at the lunch break.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, where the NZSE-40 Capital Index shed 31.08 points to close 1.3 percent lower, brokers said Greenspan's speech had been interpreted as a warning that equities were overvalued.</p>
<p>&quot;This really is a very major sell-off,&quot; said one. &quot;This is anticipating the jitters on Wall Street, a severe case of the jitters.&quot;</p>
<p>Seoul's composite stock index fell below the psychological 700-point level to 699.37 but brokers said the drop was due to disappointment over a South Korean government plan to sell Korea Telecom shares and not to Greenspan's comments.</p>
