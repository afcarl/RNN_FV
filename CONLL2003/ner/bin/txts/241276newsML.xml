<title>JAPAN: TOCOM gold/bullion rise on Greenspan comments.</title>
<headline>TOCOM gold/bullion rise on Greenspan comments.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Yen-based Tokyo gold futures ended the volatile day firmer on Friday, buoyed by strong bullion as comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan produced potential worries about the U.S. stock market and prompted funds to cover their shorts, traders said.</p>
<p>Platinum futures ended lower, with bearish sentiment carried over from overnight, the traders said.</p>
<p>Gold futures ranged from two to 10 yen per gram higher. Most-active benchmark October ending up eight yen at 1,331 yen.</p>
<p>Bullion was quoted at $373.15/45 per ounce at the Tokyo close, against $371.10/371.40 in New York on Thursday.  </p>
<p>&quot;Active short-covering by funds, sparked by Greenspan's comments, lifted spot gold during Asian hours in anticipation of falls in the U.S. stock market,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Asian stock markets slumped across the board on Friday following Greenspan's anti-inflation comments.</p>
<p>&quot;Market players were waiting for the U.S. stock market later today. But unless U.S. stocks fall significantly, gold has little scope to rise further,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>In the gold futures market, private investors were slightly on the selling side on the view that the yen's fall has been stalled, while trade houses bought futures, they said.  </p>
<p>In the platinum futures market, three distant months hit their life-of-contract lows during the day.</p>
<p>Sharp falls in Japan's stock market on Friday also caused concerns and were a negative toward the platinum market. But the price falls were offset by active bargain-hunting buying by private investors.</p>
<p>In buoyant trade, benchmark October platinum was 12 yen per gram lower at 1,341 yen. Benchmark October silver was up 1.2 yen per 10 grams at 177.8. Benchmark October palladium was down one yen at 422 yen.</p>
