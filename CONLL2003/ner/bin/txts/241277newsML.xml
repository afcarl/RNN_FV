<p>The pounding gold prices have been taking lately may be easing as recovering spot prices prompt issuers of call options to cover positions and physical demand shows signs of life, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>Activity in the options market increased briskly on Friday and volatilities skipped higher, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going flat out,&quot; one Hong Kong options trader said.</p>
<p>Dealers in the colony said bullishness was partly restored and, encouraged by buying seen overnight in New York and professionals were establishing long positions in morning trade.</p>
<p>Option issuers were having to buy spot gold continously as the price rose, an options trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;As the price rises, the more likely it is that options will be exercised on calls, therefore banks have to buy more gold to sell to the hedgers,&quot; he said. This buying was pushing up the spot market, he added.</p>
<p>Physical demand in Hong Kong had picked up too, some said.</p>
<p>Spot gold demonstrated more spirit on Friday afternoon in Hong Kong, with quotes rising to US$373.25/75 at 0600 GMT compared with its $367.40 fix in London on Tuesday -- the lowest in three years.</p>
<p>One trader said rumoured central bank sales which had dogged bullion recently may be coming to an end.</p>
<p>&quot;The worst (in central bank sales) is probably over,&quot; said a gold trader at a bullion firm, adding the sales were likely to be completed before the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Central banks have got some more gold to sell, but not that much more, because they sold a lot yesterday,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Citibank's global precious metal sales head in Sydney, Chris Fehon, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that, contrary to widespread beliefs, central banks were more likely to be behind recent sales than gold producers.</p>
<p>But the year-end view from Singapore was less optimistic even as Christmas and Chinese New Year loomed -- both traditional seasons of healthy gold demand.</p>
<p>Asian gold prices may hold briefly at current levels, but the outlook over the next few weeks remained gloomy because of weak demand and producer selling, precious metal dealers in Singapore said.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be some short covering which will keep prices firm, but people in need of cash are going to (equity markets) and not into gold,&quot; a bank dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The physical demand in Asia has dried up and we won't see any kind of buying until gold slides to around $365 an ounce,&quot; a trader in a Singapore-based bank said.</p>
<p>Spot gold was seen moving in a range between $367 and $370.</p>
<p>Traders said most buyers were keeping shy of the market on expectations that the metal still had some downside and would move in that direction before the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;If you were an investor, why would you go into gold? You could make more money somewhere else,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold is still being sold down by producers who are nervous about its soft tone,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Christmas shopping this year is very slow. There's only scattered buying around the region. Very few people are really spending money. It's very bad,&quot; a jeweller said.</p>
<p>Singapore gold premiums were quoted steady between 40-50 U.S. cents an ounce over spot London prices, dealers said.</p>
