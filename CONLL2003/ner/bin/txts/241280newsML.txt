Thai stocks dive on local worries, Greenspan.

BANGKOK 1996-12-06

Thai stocks plunged 4.35 percent by mid-session on Friday on comments regarding inflation by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and concerns over the new Thai government's ability to handle economic problems.

The SET index dropped 39.12 points to 859.20 at the lunch break.

"Investors, especially foreigners, unloaded shares after comments by U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan about American inflation," said Lan Pajasalmi of First Asia Securities.

Greenspan said in a speech on Thursday that while inflation had been low recently, its future course was uncertain and the Fed had to be forward-looking in setting policy, taking action before dangers developed.

The Fed also needed to factor the activities of bears and bulls on Wall Street into its deliberations on interest rates, he added.

Brokers said this triggered selling locally and across the region as well.

"Chances for the index to rebound today or next week are very poor as most foreign brokers have recommended to their clients to sell stocks," said a broker at a European firm.

Foreign investors have been net sellers in the Thai market since last month. Their net selling on Wednesday totalled about 900 million baht.

"Foreign investors are also unloading shares as they are about to leave for home to celebrate Christmas and New Year," said Witawus Charuchandr of Ekachart Finance and Securities.

Brokers said investors also were confused by the setting up of two economic advisory teams by Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and were unsure which team wielded more clout.

The government plans to explain its economic and other policies in parliament on December 11.
