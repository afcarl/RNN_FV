<p>Thai stocks plunged 4.35 percent by mid-session on Friday on comments regarding inflation by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and concerns over the new Thai government's ability to handle economic problems.</p>
<p>The SET index dropped 39.12 points to 859.20 at the lunch break.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors, especially foreigners, unloaded shares after comments by U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan about American inflation,&quot; said Lan Pajasalmi of First Asia Securities.</p>
<p>Greenspan said in a speech on Thursday that while inflation had been low recently, its future course was uncertain and the Fed had to be forward-looking in setting policy, taking action before dangers developed.</p>
<p>The Fed also needed to factor the activities of bears and bulls on Wall Street into its deliberations on interest rates, he added.</p>
<p>Brokers said this triggered selling locally and across the region as well.</p>
<p>&quot;Chances for the index to rebound today or next week are very poor as most foreign brokers have recommended to their clients to sell stocks,&quot; said a broker at a European firm.</p>
<p>Foreign investors have been net sellers in the Thai market since last month. Their net selling on Wednesday totalled about 900 million baht.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investors are also unloading shares as they are about to leave for home to celebrate Christmas and New Year,&quot; said Witawus Charuchandr of Ekachart Finance and Securities.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors also were confused by the setting up of two economic advisory teams by Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and were unsure which team wielded more clout.</p>
<p>The government plans to explain its economic and other policies in parliament on December 11.</p>
