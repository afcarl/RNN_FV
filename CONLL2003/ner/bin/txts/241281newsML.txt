HK Jan stock index contract fall as trade resumes.

HONG KONG 1996-12-06

Hang Seng Index futures for forward months dipped after trading resumed on Friday afternoon following a brief suspension in late morning, but then began retracing some ground, traders said.

January futures slid 640 points to 12,970 at the start of the afternoon session, but later recovered to 13,130. March fell 630 to 13,045 at the start of the session.

They were last traded in the morning down 450 and 420 points respectively before being suspended.

"There was still some stop-loss selling in the market in early afternoon but now we see slight rebound," Gary Wong of Peregrine Derivatives said.

Activity was focused on the spot month, December, as hedge funds rushed to sell earlier in reaction to U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's speech overnight.

Greenspan said Fed need not be concerned with collapsing financial asset bubble if it does not threaten real economy.

"The market has been overreacted (to the news) and I bet the Hang Seng Index should manage to close above the 13,000 level," Wong said.

December stood at 13,070, down 475 points against the low of 12,915. Turnover teached 24,039 contracts in late afternoon.
