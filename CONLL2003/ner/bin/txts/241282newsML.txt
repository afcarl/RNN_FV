Tokyo rubber futures firmer on inventory falls.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Tokyo rubber futures ended mostly firmer on Friday in thin trade, supported by news that Japan's rubber stocks at the end of November fell from a month earlier.

Prices ranged from 0.1 yen per kg lower to 0.4 yen firmer. Benchmark May was up 0.4 yen at 142.4 yen.

Activity was sluggish. "News of a fall in Japan's rubber stocks caused scattered short-covering in nearby months in the afternoon session. Otherwise, trade was featureless," a trader said. They said investors' interest in the market was thin as prices have been trapped in narrow ranges.
