Thailand's new coalition government led by Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh has been hit by internal dissent after just a week in power, coalition sources said on Friday.

A junior partner has threatened to withdraw from the six-party administration following dissatisfaction over the allocation of certain key government jobs.

In addition, a southern Thai Moslem faction within Chavalit's own main New Aspiration Party (NAP) has demanded a ministerial post in the cabinet and protested openly against lack of representation.

Concerns among local and foreign investors over how Chavalit's administration would tackle the nation's slowing economy, sluggish exports growth and a wide current account deficit contributed to a sharp fall on the bourse on Friday.

The SET stock index ended the morning session down 4.35 percent, or 39.12 points, at 859.20.

The prime minister admitted he had made mistakes and promised to make changes.

Chavalit's administration has two teams trying to tackle national economic woes.

One team has been formed under the supervision of former premier Chatichai Choonhavan whose Chart Pattana party is the second-largest coalition member.

The other is managed by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan, who was placed in charge of economic affairs in the new administration.

"Investors don't know which team has more authority in dealing with economic problems. This is a bit confusing," said Somnuk Chanrasamee of Nava Finance and Securities.

The new government is set to reveal its economic and other policies in parliament on December 11.

Samak Sundaravej, who leads the junior Bangkok-based coalition partner, Prachakorn Thai party, said on Thursday night he would review his party's position in the coalition because its nominees had failed to get jobs to solve traffic problems in the capital.

The Prachakorn Thai holds 18 seats in the 393-seat parliament. "We are made to look as if the 18 seats we have mean nothing," Samak told reporters.

The only Moslem member of parliament appointed to a senior position was former Communications Minister Wan Muhamad Nor Matha, who was made president of the parliament.

"Party supporters from the south are very angry at the party leader (Chavalit) who failed to keep his promise to appoint at least one from the south to become a minister," Muk Sulaiman, an NAP member from a southern province, told reporters.

Muk said southern Moslem MPs and their supporters were urging Wan Muhamad to resign from his post in protest.

Chavalit said on Friday he had made a wrong decision regarding southern Moslem representation in the cabinet and promised to rotate cabinet posts soon.
