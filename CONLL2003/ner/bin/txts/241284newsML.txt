TOKYO 1996-12-06

Argentina's Economic Minister Roque Fernandez said on Friday that his country is considering issuing bonds in the Euroyen market and in other currencies in 1997, given the right conditions.  

"We will keep watching closely the conditions in the capital markets in Europe as well as in Japan and the United States. Based on the liquidity conditions of these markets, we are going to find the right conditions and the right opportunity," Fernandez told a news conference.

On Thursday, Argentina announced it was issuing 50 billion yen worth of 5.0 percent samurai bonds which will mature in December 2002.

Fernandez came to Japan to oversee what was Argentina's first samurai bond issue.
