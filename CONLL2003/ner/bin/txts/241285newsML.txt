Caltex in talks to secure Iraqi crude - sources.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Caltex Petroleum Corp, the joint-venture between U.S. majors Texaco Inc and Chevron Corp, is likely to be one of the first Asian refiners to import Iraqi crude, industry sources said on Friday.

"We are in the process of making this happen," a source close to Caltex in Asia said.

He said the company could lift crude out of Iraq as early as January. The first Iraqi exports are expected in late December.

The source said various refineries within the Caltex system had expressed interest in refining Iraqi crude.  

Caltex has an interest in more than 1.0 million barrels-per-day (bpd) of refining capacity in several Asian countries including Australia, South Korea, Philippines, Thailand and Singapore.

One of its parent companies, Texaco, said earlier it would lift Iraqi crude if the United Nations (U.N.) oil-for-food deal went through.

Other refiners in Singapore, including Royal Dutch Shell, said deals are likely to be executed by their respective head offices.  

Local refiner Singapore Petroleum Co said the company was not in a hurry to buy Iraqi crude as it had not refined the crude for a very long time.

"The last time we refined Iraqi crude was some time in 1986 or 1998...even before the Gulf war," one company source said.

The source said the company was not likely to buy directly from Iraq and would probably end up buying through third parties such as the Japanese trading houses.

Under the U.N. oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to sell US$2 billion worth of oil over six months.
