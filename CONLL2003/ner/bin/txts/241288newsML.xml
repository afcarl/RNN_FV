<p>Stocks ended below the psychological 700 level on Friday with sentiment chilled by the government's plan to sell Korea Telecom shares next week, brokers said.</p>
<p>The composite stock index stood at 699.89 at the close, down 6.41 points from Thursday.</p>
<p>The level is the lowest since September 22, 1993, when the index closed at 697.56.</p>
<p>The finance ministry said just after the morning close that the government planned to sell 6.92 million shares of Korea Telecom, valued at about 260 billion won, in an auction on December 12 and 13.  </p>
<p>&quot;For investors who anticipated boosting steps by the government, it's like a slap in the face,&quot; said Kim Heung-shik of Hyundai Securities.</p>
<p>Brokers speculated that steps would include delaying of share sales of state-run firms and tax incentives for long-term stock investors.</p>
<p>They said the index could test the 650 level this month given plenty of negative factors, including fears of labour unrest and an overhang of loans for margin trading.</p>
<p>&quot;It may even be too optimistic to think that will be the bottom for this month,&quot; said a Dongwon Securities broker.  </p>
<p>Since Tuesday's announcment of labour reform plans, the first in 43 years, unions have stepped up sabre-rattling, announcing plans for mainly token strikes over the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Unions object in particular to articles that open the way to worker layoffs and the introduction of flexible working hours, which would hit seasonal workers and overstaffed industries.</p>
<p>Volume totalled 23.94 million shares, compared with 25.57 million on Thursday. Losers outpaced gainers 573 to 277 with 172 unchanged. The KOSPI 200 index fell 0.80 of a point to 72.13.</p>
