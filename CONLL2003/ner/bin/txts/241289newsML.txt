BEIJING 1996-12-06

Sales of Chinese colour televisions are expected to exceed 15 million sets in 1996, an increase of 20 percent from last year, the Xinhua news agency said on Friday.

The sales value would hit 45.0 billion yuan ($5.4 billion), Xinhua said, quoting figures from the Ministry of Electronics Industry.

Domestic sales of television sets with large screens would total more than 4.0 million sets in 1996, more than double last year's figure, the ministry said.

Large-screen sales were seen growing another 50 percent in 1997 to surpass 6.0 million sets, it said.

A price war among domestic manufacturers made local brandnames more popular among Chinese buyers, it said.

Four of China's best-known television brands -- Changhong, Kangjia, TCL and Panda -- took more than 68 percent of the market for small televisions and more than 62 percent of that for large sets, it said, but gave no further details.
