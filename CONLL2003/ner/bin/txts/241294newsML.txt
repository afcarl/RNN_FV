SEOUL 1996-12-06

Bank of Korea said on Friday it supplied 300 billion won to commercial banks through three-day repurchase agreements to relieve the acute shortage in market liquidity.  

"We have decided to supply 300 billion won due to rising market rates and an expectation that banks will not be able to meet the reserve requirement deadline tomorrow," said an official at the Bank of Korea. "The repos will help banks meet their reserve requirement obligations."
