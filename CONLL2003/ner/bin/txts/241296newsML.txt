JGBs battered after rough ride in late Tokyo.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Japanese government bond (JGB) cash and futures were battered by late Tokyo trade on Friday after large-lot selling by powerful institutional investors, including pension funds and public funds.

Traders said sales by a major Asian bank of 100 billion yen worth of benchmark 182nd JGBs had been detected just before the close of the morning session, worsening damage caused by sharp losses in U.S. Treasury bonds during Tokyo trade.  

The investor sales were partly in response to profit-taking demand and due to a combination of bearish factors, traders said.

In early trade, JGBs took a dive on a widespread talk, later denied, that the Bank of Japan would stop buying JGBs from the secondary market to check further falls in long-term yields.

"The talk was entirely a groundless rumour," a BOJ spokesman told Reuters.

The denial by the central bank gave a temporary boost to JGBs in early afternoon trade.  

However, the buoyancy soon disappeared as traders switched their attention to the fate of the U.S. stock and bond markets in Friday trade.

The key U.S. 30-year Treasury bond was down more than 1-1/3 points from Thursday's New York close and traded at 98-17/32 at 0641 GMT.

The losses were incurred after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets because that could end up doing damage to the economy."  

The yield of the benchmark 182nd 10-year JGB was at 2.460 percent at 0655 GMT, off the day's high of 2.490 percent, but still sharply higher than Thursday's 2.340 percent.

The key March JGB contract ended the session at 125.38 after dipping to a low of 125.10 from Thursday's 125.34. A hefty volume of 11.8385 trillion yen was traded.

In the swap market, rates rose across the yield curve.

The three-year swap rate rose to a quotation of 1.23/1.27 percent from Thursday's 1.14/1.18 percent.
