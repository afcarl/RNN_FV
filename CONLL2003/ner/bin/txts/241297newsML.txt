S.Korea welcomes choice of Clinton foreign team.

SEOUL 1996-12-06

South Korea on Friday welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's new foreign policy team as a group likely to keep up pressure on North Korea.

"Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha telephoned secretary of state-designate Madeleine Albright to congratulate her on President Clinton's decision," a foreign ministry spokesman said.

He said the two officials agreed to consult closely on handling communist North Korea and a reform of the United Nations.

"We don't expect any major change in U.S. policies concerning South Korea but a plus is that key members in the new foreign policy team have close personal relations with South Korean policy makers," a government official said.

Yoo was South Korea's ambassador to the United Nations for two years while Albright was the U.S. ambassador there.

South Korea's chief presidential foreign policy adviser, Ban Ki-moon, is friendly with Samuel Berger, who was named new U.S. presidential national security adviser.

"The U.S. policy of trying to guide North Korea to a soft landing and keeping the freeze on Pyongyang's nuclear programme will continue," the official said. "The new team is also likely to promote dialogue between South and North Korea," he added.

Another government official said both Albright and Republican William Cohen, the designated defence secretary, were well aware of the threat North Korea posed in northeast Asia.

"I expect them to be tough on any North Korean provocation and to help build up U.S.-South Korean deterrence against the North," he said.

But Kim Choong-nam, a fellow at the state-financed Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, said he expected the new team's pressure on North Korea to be limited in view of U.S. needs to improve ties with China.

"China will take the top priority in Washington's Asian policy and in view of China's friendly ties with North Korea, the United States could seek some compromises," he said.

North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, supported by China. The South was aided by a U.S.-led United Nations force.

North and South Korea remain technically at war after hostilities ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a peace treaty.
