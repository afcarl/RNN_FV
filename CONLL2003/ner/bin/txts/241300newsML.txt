Philippines cuts rate on loans to exporters.

MANILA 1996-12-06

The Philippines' Central Bank said on Friday it had cut the interest rate applied to its Exporters Dollar Facility (EDF) to 5.375 percent from 5.53125 percent per annum.

The EDF is adjusted every three months based on the three-month London Interbank Bid rate. The new rate will take effect on Monday, December 9.

The facility is open to banks which will relend the money to exporters with a spread of not more than one percent.

Availments for 1996 under the programme have reached $254.1 million as of December 3, higher than $150.3 million lent out during the whole of 1995.
