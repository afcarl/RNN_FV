MANILA 1996-12-06

Three Asian groups were the strongest contenders for a contract to put up a 1,200-megawatt Philippine power plant as their bids were among the lowest of six bidders, the National Power Corp (Napocor) said on Friday.

"Its a close fight between the consortium of Marubeni Corp, Alsons and Korea Electric," a top Napocor official who did not want to be named told Reuters.

The power firm opened on Friday the financial bids of six bidders namely Marubeni Corp with Sithe Energy; Korea Electric Power Corp; Ilijan Power Corp led by Enron Corp; PowerGen Plc with Siemens AG; Consolidated Electric Power Asia with Mitsubishi Corp; and the consortium of Alsons Power Holdings-Tomen Corp -Singapore Power Inc.

The bids had two components, the capacity fee or actual cost of power to be paid by Napocor and the operation and maintenance fee.

Napocor said it could not immediately say who is the lowest bidder as it has to conduct its own evaluation.

Awarding of the contract is set in March next year.
