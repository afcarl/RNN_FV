Singapore electronics slump seen bottoming out.

October's manufacturing figures confirmed the slump in Singapore's electronics sector had bottomed out, but there could be bumps ahead before a recovery was confirmed, economists said on Friday.

Trade and manufacturing numbers could lapse into flat to negative territory into the first quarter of 1997 and a sure recovery might not happen until the second quarter, they said.

On Thursday, the Economic Development Board said Singapore's manufacturing output in October inched up 1.8 percent year-on-year, snapping two straight months of decline. The rise was boosted by a 4.2 percent increase in electronics output.

Electronics, computers and related products contribute almost half Singapore's total industrial production and almost 60 percent of its non-oil exports.

In August and September, industrial output fell 7.0 and 6.7 percent respectively.

The October figures show "we are somewhere at the bottom but we are still bumping around at the bottom", said Song Seng Wun, an economist at HG Asia.

"It confirms our view the bottom in electronics and manufacturing has been seen. This figure shows the pace of recovery remains extremely modest. In the coming months we still expect a comparatively sluggish growth," said Desmond Supple, senior emerging markets economist at I.D.E.A.

Economists said the rise in electronics output was patchy -- due mostly to higher production of disk drives, computer peripherals and printed circuit board assembly segments.

The EDB said export demand for semiconductors, consumer electronics and telecommunications equipment stayed weak.

"This kind of rather uneven picture suggests we're not into clear skies yet. There's still a rather turbulent period ahead," said Song.

The economists said November's trade and manufacturing numbers could be flat to negative due to the high base in 1995 and the outlook for the next few months after that was still unclear.

"The numbers forward for the next three to four months will remain choppy. Seasonally, Christmas is a wind-down period. Whether manufacturers will take the opportunity to prime the pump in January remains to be seen. I doubt they will," said Song.

Economists said semiconductor exports would continue to lag other electronic products into next year.

"It's mainly because of the price falls (in semiconductors)," said Liew Yin Sze, chief economist at JM Sassoon.

Singapore's semiconductor production was mostly concentrated in dynamic random access memories (DRAM) chips and logic chips for electronic consumer goods, economists said.

"DRAMs saw a price spurt in October but fell back again. It is now hovering around US$9.00-9.50 per chip," said Liew.

"It (the DRAM price) will be sluggish for a while until we go into next year. The price started plunging early this year. By next year the price effect will gradually even off," he said.

Singapore also faced stiff competition in the semiconductor sector with huge capacity coming from South Korea, said Song.

Countries like Malaysia and Philippines were also more cost competitive than Singapore, said Supple.
