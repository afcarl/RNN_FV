Tokyo's key Nikkei index ended down more than three percent on Friday, the biggest one-day drop this year. Participants were stunned by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments on the stock markets, which fueled worries over the recent euphoria on Wall Street and invited sales.

The Nikkei 225 average shed 667.20 points or 3.19 percent to close at 20,276.70. It briefly fell as low as 20,171.69.

Its December futures were 730 points lower at 20,210.
