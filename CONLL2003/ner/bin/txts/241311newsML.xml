<p>Tokyo's key Nikkei index ended down more than three percent on Friday, the biggest one-day drop this year. Participants were stunned by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments on the stock markets, which fueled worries over the recent euphoria on Wall Street and invited sales.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 average shed 667.20 points or 3.19 percent to close at 20,276.70. It briefly fell as low as 20,171.69.</p>
<p>Its December futures were 730 points lower at 20,210.  </p>
<p>Greenspan said in a lecture to a dinner meeting on Thursday that the Federal Reserve must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stock and other asset markets because that could end up doing damage to the economy.</p>
<p>Tokyo stocks had risen earlier in the day, supported by news that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) would be split up into one long-distance company and two local-call firms.</p>
<p>The news encouraged buying of NTT shares as well as some other blue-chip issues such as Sony Corp.</p>
<p>NTT shares gained 15,000 yen to end at 845,000 yen.  </p>
<p>The NTT share price briefly jumped as high as 861,000 yen.</p>
<p>Shares in Sony closed 30 yen lower at 7,470 yen, after hitting a high for the year at 7,630 yen in the morning session.</p>
<p>On the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), turnover was at 441 million shares on Friday, against the previous day's 356 million shares.</p>
<p>In other indices, the TOPIX index of all first section stocks fell 34.75 points or 2.24 percent to end at 1,517.01. The Nikkei 300 average closed 6.93 points or 2.36 percent lower at 286.99.  </p>
<p>Brokers also said the sell-off in the Nikkei average was initially touched off by speculative sales in its futures.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was easily knocked down by the futures amid thin trading volume and feeble market energy,&quot; Credit Suisse Investment's Takahashi said.</p>
<p>Brokers also said falls in the Nikkei accelerated after it broke below 20,500 because it fanned panicky loss-cut selling.</p>
<p>Tim Hayashida, strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc, said the stock index had already reached a point that requires a downward correction and that today's sales were exaggerated by Greenspan's comments.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have to see very carefully if the New York market will be hurt by the Greenspan comment tonight,&quot; Credit Suisse Investment's Takahashi said.</p>
<p>On the first section of the TSE, losing issues overwhelmed gainers 956 to 179, while 114 issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>Advancing sectors were led by warehousing, mining, railway/bus, real estate and insurance.</p>
<p>The only major retreating sector was communications.</p>
<p>Shares in the banking sector  0#BNK.T, which have been dipressed lately by their dim business outlook due to industry bad loan problems, continued to fall on Friday, brokers said.  </p>
<p>On the second section of the TSE, the index fell 3.34 points to 1,926.75, with 9.97 million shares traded.</p>
