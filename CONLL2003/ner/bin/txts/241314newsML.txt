Singapore stocks down on HK fall, U.S. bonds.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Singapore shares fell more than two percent on Friday morning after a sharp fall on the Hong Kong stock market.

Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index had fallen 49.85 points, or 2.25 percent, to 2,164.32 by its lunchtime close at 0430 GMT.

Dealers said investors were worried by overnight comments by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan about "irrational exuberance" in stock markets and also by a fall in U.S. bond markets.

Greenspan's remarks were understood by some investors to be a warning that the long rally in U.S. shares might have been overdone and a downward correction might be on its way.

Many dealers had been predicting a fall towards 2,150 points on the Straits Times Industrials Index, but they said the speed of the decline had taken them by surprise.

"When the U.S. sneezes, we all catch a cold," said one local dealer. "Singapore was following Hong Kong."

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 569.90 points, or 4.22 percent, to 12,921.66 by the end of its morning session.

In Singapore, most of the big falls were in blue chips that had gained over the past few days, including banks and several large industrial stocks.

Banks OCBC foreign and DBS foreign both fell 70 cents to Singapore $16.50 and S$17.90 respectively, while UOB foreign shares dropped 50 cents to S$14.80.

A total of 378 Singapore stocks registered falls versus only 18 gainers on brisk volume of 100.38 million shares. $1 = $1.40
