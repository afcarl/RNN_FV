<p>Singapore shares fell more than two percent on Friday morning after a sharp fall on the Hong Kong stock market.</p>
<p>Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index had fallen 49.85 points, or 2.25 percent, to 2,164.32 by its lunchtime close at 0430 GMT.</p>
<p>Dealers said investors were worried by overnight comments by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan about &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in stock markets and also by a fall in U.S. bond markets.</p>
<p>Greenspan's remarks were understood by some investors to be a warning that the long rally in U.S. shares might have been overdone and a downward correction might be on its way.</p>
<p>Many dealers had been predicting a fall towards 2,150 points on the Straits Times Industrials Index, but they said the speed of the decline had taken them by surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;When the U.S. sneezes, we all catch a cold,&quot; said one local dealer. &quot;Singapore was following Hong Kong.&quot;</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 569.90 points, or 4.22 percent, to 12,921.66 by the end of its morning session.</p>
<p>In Singapore, most of the big falls were in blue chips that had gained over the past few days, including banks and several large industrial stocks.</p>
<p>Banks OCBC foreign and DBS foreign both fell 70 cents to Singapore $16.50 and S$17.90 respectively, while UOB foreign shares dropped 50 cents to S$14.80.</p>
<p>A total of 378 Singapore stocks registered falls versus only 18 gainers on brisk volume of 100.38 million shares. $1 = $1.40</p>
