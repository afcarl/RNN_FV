MANILA 1996-12-06

Tollway operator and construction firm Philippine National Construction Corp said on Friday it signed a memorandum of understanding with Hongkong Concrete Company Limited that could pave the way for a joint venture agreement.

PNCC president Rogelio Luis said in a statement the company was considering setting up a joint venture for a cement silo plant and concrete hatching plant.

They will also explore other areas of cooperation in construction materials.

Government-controlled PNCC also said it signed an agreement for the immediate construction of a road project with the state's Bases Conversion Development Authority and its subsidiaries Clark Development Corp and Clark International Airport Corp.

The project, the six-kilometre Mabalacat-Clark Spur Road, will have a four-lane expressway.

It is scheduled to be finished late next year.
