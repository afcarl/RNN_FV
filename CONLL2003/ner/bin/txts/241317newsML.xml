<text>
<p>The following are key facts about Japanese telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT), which is to be split into three telephone firms under a giant holding company in a government plan unveiled on Friday.</p>
<p>-- The former state-owned telephone company was privatised in April 1985 but still dominates the nation's local telephone networks, with a market share of 80 percent.</p>
<p>-- NTT first went public in early 1987, but the government still owns 65 percent of its shares. The government has been forced to postpone the planned listing of more NTT shares in the face of a sluggish Tokyo stock market, hit hard by the bursting of the 1980s economic &quot;bubble&quot; of inflated asset prices. The government had planned to sell 500,000 NTT shares in 1996/97, but the plan has yet to materialise.</p>
<p>-- Faced with the opening of Japan's telecommunications market, NTT, employing 185,000 workers, is shrinking itself to compete more efficiently with new entrants into the market but it will still have 150,000 workers by the year 2000.</p>
<p>-- NTT, the world's biggest telecoms company in terms of sales, has for years relied on long-distance domestic services as its major source of income. In the year that ended on March 31, the long-distance service accounted for 75 percent of its parent operating profits, which totalled 441 billion yen ($3.93 billion). Its operating revenue totalled 6.2 trillion yen ($55.3 billion) in 1995/96.</p>
<p>-- NTT's parent current profit, which is before tax and includes extraordinary items, jumped to 328.9 billion yen ($2.93 billion) in 1995/96, 2.3 times higher than its year-ago levels, encouraged by a cellular phone boom and soaring demand for communications via computers, which boosted NTT's phone traffic.</p>
<p>-- Japan's NTT law stipulates that the company must limit its operations to the domestic market. The government has long argued that a break-up is needed before NTT can enter global telecoms markets. ($1=112 yen)</p>
