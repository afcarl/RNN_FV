China, Vietnam discuss security cooperation - VNA.

HANOI 1996-12-06

China's State Security Minister Jia Chunwang and his Vietnamese counterpart Le Minh Huong have discussed measures this week to increase security cooperation, the official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said on Friday.

The VNA report gave few details of the talks, but quoted Jia as telling Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in a subsequent meeting that his ministry "would continue to expect cooperation and share experience with Vietnam in security work..."

Ties between China and Vietnam have improved since the two socialist neighbours normalised relations in 1992.

Rail links were restored earlier this year after a 17-year hiatus and Chinese Premier Li Peng made history in late June by attending the opening session of Vietnam's Communist Party Congress.

However diplomats and analysts say that despite public images of solidarity, the relationship still lacks depth.

Naval forces from the two countries clashed in 1988 about sovereignty over island chains in the South China Sea and border differences are still unresolved.
