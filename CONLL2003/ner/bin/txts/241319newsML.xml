<p>The Beijing city legislature has issued a regulation giving it sweeping new controls over the municipal budget after a high-level corruption scandal rocked the Chinese capital, the Xinhua news agency said on Friday.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, effective from January 1, 1997, the Beijing Municipal People's Congress would supervise the city's income and expenditure and the implementation of the budget, apparently boosting the power of the rubber-stamp legislature.</p>
<p>The rules were aimed at tightening financial supervision of the city after vice-mayor Wang Baosen committed suicide last year after coming under investigation for corruption, Xinhua quoted Gong Shuji, director of the congress' Finance Committee, as saying.</p>
<p>Wang had committed &quot;serious financial crimes, including creating fake budgets, evasion of supervision, transfer of funds outside the budget and embezzlement and abuse of public funds&quot;, Gong said.</p>
<p>Wang's graft and embezzlement has been reported to have involved up to $37 million and his death eventually led to the downfall of Beijing municipal Communist Party chief Chen Xitong and a reshuffle of senior city officials.</p>
<p>&quot;The local legislature drew lessons from the incident and drew up the new supervision measures in an effort to regulate the budget along legal lines,&quot; Gong said.</p>
<p>Any changes to the budget would require the approval of the congress, Xinhua said, adding that the body would hold veto power over budgetary decisions by other branches of the city government.</p>
<p>&quot;The legislature is authorised to declare void the municipal government's improper decisions and orders relating to the budget,&quot; Xinhua said.</p>
<p>The regulation would also grant the legislature powers to supervise tax collection, it said.</p>
<p>The legislature passed a law in October ordering the city government to consult congress members before making major decisions on urban planning, important projects and economic development programmes.</p>
