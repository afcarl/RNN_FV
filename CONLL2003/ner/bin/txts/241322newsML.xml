<p>Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd and Barrick Gold Corp are to continue negotiations to hammer out a partnership agreement to develop the spectacular Busang gold find in Indonesia, sources close to the talks said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The negotiations will be held both in Toronto and in Jakarta,&quot; one source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Another source said most of the key negotiators from both Bre-X and Barrick had returned to Toronto, but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations.</p>
<p>Both sources said Bre-X and Barrick did not hold talks on Thursday with Mines and Energy Ministry Secretary-General Umar Said, who is coordinating the negotiations over the Busang find in East Kalimantan.</p>
<p>The first source also said Bre-X had until December 21 to submit to the Indonesian Mines and Energy Ministry a feasibility study on the central region of the Busang property, estimated to contain 2.6 million ounces of gold.  </p>
<p>The richest parts of the property to the north and south of the central region have been estimated by Bre-X to contain 57 million ounces of gold.</p>
<p>&quot;Bre-X is expected to complete the feasibility report by December 16 and submit it to the government before the December 21 deadline,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>He said Bre-X would then formally seek the permission of the Indonesian government to begin construction to develop Busang's central region, which might take up to two years.</p>
<p>The source declined to say if there had been any progress in the talks between Bre-X and Barrick.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is a huge project...we are not selling furniture, and Bre-X has 13,000 shareholders to answer to,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>&quot;While there has been some agreement in principle on some issues, there are still others such as procedures and mechanisms that needed to be sorted out,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The source said no new deadline had been set by the Mines and Energy Ministry for Bre-X and Barrick to strike a deal.</p>
<p>The Ministry had given the companies until December 4 to complete a partnership deal, and advised Bre-X to take a 25 percent stake and Barrick 75 percent to develop the property.  </p>
<p>&quot;As far as I am aware, there's been no new deadline,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>The Ministry's Umar said on Thursday that both Bre-X and Barrick had responded positively to a government letter recommending a 25-75 split in the Busang gold property. The government also wants 10 percent of the property.</p>
<p>Umar said the government had yet to receive a formal reply from the companies. He had said earlier that if the two companies failed to reach a partnership agreement, the government would explore other ways to expedite development of the Busang find.  </p>
<p>Bre-X has a partnership deal with PT Panutan Duta of the Panutan Group run by President Suharto's eldest son, Sigit Harjojudanto, under which Panutan would receive $40 million over 40 months plus a 10 percent stake Busang's richest parts.</p>
<p>Barrick has teamed up with a construction company in the Citra Group of Suharto's eldest daughter, Siti Hardianti Rukmana, in what Barrick had said was a partnership &quot;to prepare us for a potential mining development project&quot;.</p>
