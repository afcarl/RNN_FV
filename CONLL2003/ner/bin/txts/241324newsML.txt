China's steel firm to launch 400 mln A shares.

HONG KONG 1996-12-06

Benggang Steel Sheet (Group) Co Ltd has filed an application with the China Securities Regulatory Commission to offer 400 million A shares and list them in Shenzhen, a company official said on Friday.

Benggang, based in the city of Bengxi in northeastern Liaoning province, makes steel products for a number of China's major automobile makers, the official told the Hong Kong-based China Securities Bulletin newsletter.

The initial public offering (IPO) would be launched in 1997 and a lead underwriter for the offer was currently being selected, he added.

If the issue goes through, the firm planned to use the money to improve its production technology, the official said.

The firm's total share capital and results over the past few years would not be released to the public until its restructuring into a joint-stock entity, currently underway, is completed, he said.

China's giant Bengxi Steel and Iron (Group) Co Ltd, a state-owned enterprise, would be Benggang's biggest shareholder, the official said.
