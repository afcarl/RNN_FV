Manila's PHIBOR mostly steady, one-month rate up.

MANILA 1996-12-06

The Philippine interbank offered rates (PHIBOR) were mostly unchanged, with only two maturities inching higher, traders said.

The one-month PHIBOR inched up to 11 percent from 10 15/16 percent following the increase in banks' special savings rate as part of their year-end window-dressing.

Six-month rates also inched up marginally.

Other rates were steady as in the spot rates.

"The swap rates are just following the spot rates," one trader said.
