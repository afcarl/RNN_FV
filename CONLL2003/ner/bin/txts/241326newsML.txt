Hanoi declares dissident temple a national site.

HANOI 1996-12-06

Vietnam said on Friday that a 395-year-old temple in Hue, known as a seat of Buddhist dissent, had been officially declared a national heritage site.

The announcement, carried in state newspapers, followed warnings by an overseas Buddhist watchdog group that Hanoi was seeking to take control of the Linh Mu temple, a treasured monument of Vietnamese Buddhism.

The English-language Vietnam News said senior clergymen had been handed a certificate of recognition by government officials during a ceremony on Wednesday attended by Buddhist monks, followers and local villagers.

The immediate effect of the move was not clear, but an official at the National UNESCO Committee in Hanoi told Reuters the decision meant the Culture Ministry would fund preservation work and determine the temple's future usage.

The temple, also known as the Thien Mu Pagoda, lies on the banks of the Perfume River in Hue, and is already recognised by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) as a world heritage site.

Hanoi dismissed reports earlier in the week by the Paris-based International Buddhist Information Bureau that some 200 police had surrounded the temple last month and arrested two monks in a sweep against religious dissidents.

A foreign ministry spokesman said the monks, Le Phu Thinh and Nguyen Chon Tam, had been invited to return to residences outside Hue and Quang Tri where they were ordered to stay after their release from prison last year.

Both men had been jailed in 1993 for taking part in a demonstration in Hue for religious freedom.

They are members of the banned Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), the Buddhist church organisation in former South Vietnam prior to the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.

The UBCV is still viewed by Buddhists in the south and abroad as the sole legitimate church organisation. But Hanoi recognises only the state-sponsored Vietnam Buddhist Church.
