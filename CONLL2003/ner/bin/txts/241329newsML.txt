No change in ties under new U.S. cabinet - Hashimoto.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said on Friday he does not expect any change in U.S.-Japan ties after new cabinet appointments in the Clinton administration.

"I think we have a basic situation where we can maintain stable ties with the United States," Hashimoto told reporters when asked what he thought of President Bill Clinton's new appointees.

"I do not expect any changes in U.S.-Japan ties and I hope we can work together to deepen our relations."

But government sources said both key nominees -- U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright as secretary of state and veteran Republican Senator William Cohen as defence secretary -- were unfamiliar with Japan and that the Tokyo government would start making arrangements for their Japanese counterparts to meet them as soon as possible.

Earlier this week, the United States and Japan resolved their biggest political issue over plans to streamline U.S. military bases on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa.

On Monday, outgoing Defence Secretary William Perry signed an agreement which stipulated that the U.S. military would hand back a fifth of the land it now occupies on Okinawa.

The East China Sea island houses more than 75 percent of all U.S. military facilities in Japan.
