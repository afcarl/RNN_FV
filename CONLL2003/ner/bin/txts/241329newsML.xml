<p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said on Friday he does not expect any change in U.S.-Japan ties after new cabinet appointments in the Clinton administration.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we have a basic situation where we can maintain stable ties with the United States,&quot; Hashimoto told reporters when asked what he thought of President Bill Clinton's new appointees.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not expect any changes in U.S.-Japan ties and I hope we can work together to deepen our relations.&quot;</p>
<p>But government sources said both key nominees -- U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright as secretary of state and veteran Republican Senator William Cohen as defence secretary -- were unfamiliar with Japan and that the Tokyo government would start making arrangements for their Japanese counterparts to meet them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the United States and Japan resolved their biggest political issue over plans to streamline U.S. military bases on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa.</p>
<p>On Monday, outgoing Defence Secretary William Perry signed an agreement which stipulated that the U.S. military would hand back a fifth of the land it now occupies on Okinawa.</p>
<p>The East China Sea island houses more than 75 percent of all U.S. military facilities in Japan.</p>
