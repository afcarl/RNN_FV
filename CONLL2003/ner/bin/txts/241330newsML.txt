Vietnam to increase areas planted to rubber.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Vietnam will increase the area planted to rubber trees to 700,000 hectares in 2005 from a little over 300,000 hectares in 1996, an official of the Vietnam General Rubber Corp said on Friday.

Le Dinh Vu, deputy manager of the company's Export-Import department, said at an Asia Rubber Markets conference in Singapore that most of the available land suitable for rubber is located in the highlands of central Vietnam.  

"The Vietnamese government has recommended coffee and rubber for the highlands. Rubber is preferable because it does not require much water and the price of rubber is more stable than that of coffee," Le said.

"The prospect of 700,000 hectares of rubber plantations by the year 2005 is achievable," the official added.

No production figures were immediately available.

Hanoi plans to seek loans from organisations like the World Bank and the French Development Fund worth about US$100 million to help fund rubber plantation development.  

Vietnam has been cited by commodity trading houses scuh as Cargill as one country where rubber production will expand sharply beyond the turn of the century.
