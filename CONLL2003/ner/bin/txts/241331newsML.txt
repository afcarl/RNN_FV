China to import 1.2 mln tonnes of rubber by 2000.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

China will probably need to import 500,000 tonnes of natural rubber and 700,000 tonnes of synthetic rubber a year by 2000, a scientist with the Chinese Academy of Tropical and Agricultural Science said on Friday.

Zhou Jiannan said at the Asia Rubber Markets conference that China's domestic production cannot keep pace with demand and the gap now reaches about 400,000 tonnes annually.

"Undoubtedly, China has to import rubber in the future in large amounts," Zhou said. "It is impossible to expand, on a large scale, the rubber planting area due to economic and climatic reasons."  

China's natural rubber output is expected to reach 450,000 tonnes while synthetic rubber production should hit between 600,000 to 650,000 tonnes by 2000.

"With the passage of time, China needs to import more and more rubber," Zhou said.

Some of the problems facing China's rubber industry include low-yielding trees on up to one-third of the rubber farms, escalating production costs, and natural disasters which often strike Hainan island where many rubber farms are located.
