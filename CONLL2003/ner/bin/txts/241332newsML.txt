Sri Lanka rubber output to rise, exports to slide.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Sri Lanka's natural rubber production is forecast to rise to 123,000 tonnes in 2000 from 105,700 tonnes in 1995, but exports could slide, the chairman of the Colombo Rubber Traders Association said on Friday.

W.T. Ellawala told an Asia Rubber Markets conference in Singapore that production will rise due to "an accelerated replanting programme, widespread use of high-yielding (varieties) and improved cultivation and processing techniques."

But the volume of Sri Lanka's exports should slide to 61,000 tonnes by 2000 from 68,200 tonnes last year and 100,400 tonnes in 1986 largely due to increasing domestic consumption.  

"Sri Lanka will face severe competition in trading natural rubber in bulk form, but the effects of product diversification and value addition will make the industry more competitive by the year 2000," Ellawala said.

L.M.K. Tillekeratne, director of the Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka, said in another paper at the meeting that the country should take steps to enhance its position as the sole producer of latex crepe rubber.

The material is made especially for the manufacture of surgical and pharmaceutical rubber products, infant toys and rubber goods used in contact with food.  

"So far, there is not even a single such factory set up in Sri Lanka to utilise this clean commodity for the manufacture of valued added pharmaceutical products," Tillekeratne said.

Manufacturers should also use sole crepe rubber "which is considered as ideal for making winter boots due to its exceptional ability to grip on ice," he added.

Sri Lanka is a minor producer of rubber and its production pales in comparison to the three biggest producers in Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia.
