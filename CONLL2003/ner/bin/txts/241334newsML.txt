Cambodian soldiers skirmish, raising tensions.

PHNOM PENH 1996-12-06

Government soldiers loyal to feuding parties fought a firefight in northwest Cambodia late on Thursday, injuring two bystanders and underscoring tensions within the ruling coalition, officials said on Friday.

The incident came one day after co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh said he had ordered an investigation into the killing of two members of his royalist FUNCINPEC party.

It also followed three days of top-level provincial talks, which concluded on Thursday, aimed at smoothing out strained relations between FUNCINPEC and its coalition partner, the formerly communist Cambodian People's Party (CPP).

"We just had three days of meetings here with top leaders from three provinces...and everything was solved. We understood each other, and agreed to stop fighting with each other," said a deputy military commander in a telephone interview from Battambang, 300 kilometres (188 miles) northwest of Phnom Penh.

"Last night was unlucky ... (The two parties) are still suspicious of each other," he said.

At approximately 11.30 p.m. (1630 GMT) on Thursday, several soldiers loyal to the CPP left a nightclub in Battambang near the party's provincial headquarters and began firing their AK-47s into the air. When several soldiers loyal to FUNCINPEC intervened with their B40 rocket launchers, a firefight ensued, military and political officials told Reuters.

A motorcycle driver and street vendor were injured in the exchange, and several of the rockets landed near the CPP headquarters, they said.

No soldiers were wounded and the exact number involved was unclear.

Battambang deputy governor Serey Kosal, a FUNCINPEC official, told Reuters one CPP official had been arrested.

Serey Kosal had called out 5,000 troops after a similar skirmish two weeks ago resulted in the injury of a CPP military policeman. The incident fuelled tensions between Ranariddh and Hun Sen.

On Thursday, the rift between the two leaders appeared to widen when Ranariddh called for an investigation into the recent killings of two FUNCINPEC officials in central Cambodia.

A top Interior Ministry official said the murders were political.

Ranariddh and Hun Sen formed an uneasy coalition following 1993 U.N.-sponsored elections, but the two leaders are often at odds and Cambodia's military and police have retained their pre-election loyalities.

Analysts say the animosity between the two parties and their forces was likely continue through the 1998 elections, which will pit the two premiers against each other.
