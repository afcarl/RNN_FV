<headline>Cambodian soldiers skirmish, raising tensions.</headline>

<p>Government soldiers loyal to feuding parties fought a firefight in northwest Cambodia late on Thursday, injuring two bystanders and underscoring tensions within the ruling coalition, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The incident came one day after co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh said he had ordered an investigation into the killing of two members of his royalist FUNCINPEC party.</p>
<p>It also followed three days of top-level provincial talks, which concluded on Thursday, aimed at smoothing out strained relations between FUNCINPEC and its coalition partner, the formerly communist Cambodian People's Party (CPP).</p>
<p>&quot;We just had three days of meetings here with top leaders from three provinces...and everything was solved. We understood each other, and agreed to stop fighting with each other,&quot; said a deputy military commander in a telephone interview from Battambang, 300 kilometres (188 miles) northwest of Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>&quot;Last night was unlucky ... (The two parties) are still suspicious of each other,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At approximately 11.30 p.m. (1630 GMT) on Thursday, several soldiers loyal to the CPP left a nightclub in Battambang near the party's provincial headquarters and began firing their AK-47s into the air. When several soldiers loyal to FUNCINPEC intervened with their B40 rocket launchers, a firefight ensued, military and political officials told Reuters.</p>
<p>A motorcycle driver and street vendor were injured in the exchange, and several of the rockets landed near the CPP headquarters, they said.</p>
<p>No soldiers were wounded and the exact number involved was unclear.</p>
<p>Battambang deputy governor Serey Kosal, a FUNCINPEC official, told Reuters one CPP official had been arrested.</p>
<p>Serey Kosal had called out 5,000 troops after a similar skirmish two weeks ago resulted in the injury of a CPP military policeman. The incident fuelled tensions between Ranariddh and Hun Sen.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the rift between the two leaders appeared to widen when Ranariddh called for an investigation into the recent killings of two FUNCINPEC officials in central Cambodia.</p>
<p>A top Interior Ministry official said the murders were political.</p>
<p>Ranariddh and Hun Sen formed an uneasy coalition following 1993 U.N.-sponsored elections, but the two leaders are often at odds and Cambodia's military and police have retained their pre-election loyalities.</p>
<p>Analysts say the animosity between the two parties and their forces was likely continue through the 1998 elections, which will pit the two premiers against each other.</p>
