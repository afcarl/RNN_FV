The government's decision to split up Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp under a holding company is a major victory for NTT and may have only a limited effect in boosting competition, analysts said on Friday.

They said that this sort of break-up would not put any additional market pressure on the individual NTT units, and that significant competition within the same group would be difficult.

"It's a shell game," said a telecommunications expert at the U.S. Embassy in Japan. "It's a major victory (for NTT).  

"Mega-mergers certainly helped support NTT's argument that it should not be broken into smaller, independent units," he said.

British Telecom and MCI of the United States announced plans last month to merge into a $20 billion company.

Yoshio Suzuki, a former member of a government deregulation committee which earlier this year recommended breaking up NTT without creating a holding company, said the latest plan would jeopardise the healthy development of Japan's telecommunications market.

"The new scheme means NTT remains one big company," he said. "We can't expect such things like harsh rate cuts, competition and reasonable services. It is welcome news for BT and the world's big carriers that Japan's market will remain inactive for years," he said.  

"Earlier this year, we recommended the creation of independent, competitive NTT units, which were supposed to compete with each other and create a market free of government regulations," he said. "This (the new scheme) is totally different from what was recommended."

Suzuki, president of Asahi Research Centre, also questioned if the new NTT will have much management freedom.

Under the scheme, the new holding company will own 100 percent of the shares in the three phone units. Except for the long-distance call unit, all will have public responsibilities, such as providing certain services to the public.  

"You can't call it a private firm if it is not allowed to go public through a stock listing," Suzuki said.

Masahito Tani, bureau chief at the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, said the long-distance call unit would be allowed to invest in foreign operators and compete globally as a private company, although for the time being foreign operators would not be able to invest in it as all of its shares would be held by the holding company.

But Kiyohisa Ota, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc, said the proposed management structure for NTT was a step towards establishing a fair and competitive telecommunications market in Japan.  

"When combined with two other measures, the goal of establishing a fair and competitive market in Japan can be reached to a certain extent," Ota said.

Ota said the two other measures were establishment of access rules and lifting of foreign ownership restrictions on Japanese telecoms firms.

The government is expected to soon draw up rules aimed at giving NTT's competitors fair access to its local call networks at appropriate costs.

Competitors have been unable to compete successfully with NTT mainly due to lack of fair access to its local networks.
