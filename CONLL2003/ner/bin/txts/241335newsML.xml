<p>The government's decision to split up Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp under a holding company is a major victory for NTT and may have only a limited effect in boosting competition, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said that this sort of break-up would not put any additional market pressure on the individual NTT units, and that significant competition within the same group would be difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a shell game,&quot; said a telecommunications expert at the U.S. Embassy in Japan. &quot;It's a major victory (for NTT).  </p>
<p>&quot;Mega-mergers certainly helped support NTT's argument that it should not be broken into smaller, independent units,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>British Telecom and MCI of the United States announced plans last month to merge into a $20 billion company.</p>
<p>Yoshio Suzuki, a former member of a government deregulation committee which earlier this year recommended breaking up NTT without creating a holding company, said the latest plan would jeopardise the healthy development of Japan's telecommunications market.</p>
<p>&quot;The new scheme means NTT remains one big company,&quot; he said. &quot;We can't expect such things like harsh rate cuts, competition and reasonable services. It is welcome news for BT and the world's big carriers that Japan's market will remain inactive for years,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Earlier this year, we recommended the creation of independent, competitive NTT units, which were supposed to compete with each other and create a market free of government regulations,&quot; he said. &quot;This (the new scheme) is totally different from what was recommended.&quot;</p>
<p>Suzuki, president of Asahi Research Centre, also questioned if the new NTT will have much management freedom.</p>
<p>Under the scheme, the new holding company will own 100 percent of the shares in the three phone units. Except for the long-distance call unit, all will have public responsibilities, such as providing certain services to the public.  </p>
<p>&quot;You can't call it a private firm if it is not allowed to go public through a stock listing,&quot; Suzuki said.</p>
<p>Masahito Tani, bureau chief at the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, said the long-distance call unit would be allowed to invest in foreign operators and compete globally as a private company, although for the time being foreign operators would not be able to invest in it as all of its shares would be held by the holding company.</p>
<p>But Kiyohisa Ota, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc, said the proposed management structure for NTT was a step towards establishing a fair and competitive telecommunications market in Japan.  </p>
<p>&quot;When combined with two other measures, the goal of establishing a fair and competitive market in Japan can be reached to a certain extent,&quot; Ota said.</p>
<p>Ota said the two other measures were establishment of access rules and lifting of foreign ownership restrictions on Japanese telecoms firms.</p>
<p>The government is expected to soon draw up rules aimed at giving NTT's competitors fair access to its local call networks at appropriate costs.</p>
<p>Competitors have been unable to compete successfully with NTT mainly due to lack of fair access to its local networks.</p>
