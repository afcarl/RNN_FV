<p>Three construction workers were injured and 14 others were missing following a mudslide on Friday in a central Japanese mountain village, police said.</p>
<p>The mudslide at Otari village in Nagano prefecture, 230 km (138 miles) northwest of Tokyo, washed away a bridge and cut off access to the homes of about 30 people, police said.</p>
<p>The missing workers, including three women, were among a crew of about 50 who were repairing roads that had been damaged when a previous flash flood swept tonnes of rocks and mud down a steep mountain, police said.</p>
<p>Six workers were rescued, one of whom was seriously injured. Two sustained moderate injuries, police said.</p>
<p>The accident took place in a ski resort and hot spring spa area, a region of rugged mountains which is highly prone to landslides.</p>
<p>Otari is located near one of the main ski slopes to be used in the 1998 Winter Olympics at Nagano.</p>
