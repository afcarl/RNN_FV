Poultry firm Vitarich Corp said on Friday its board had approved a plan to sell non-essential assets to finance its working capital and expansion programmes.

Counsel Tadeo Hilado told the Philippine Stock Exchange the sale would raise about 400 million to 600 million pesos for the company.

He did not specify which assets would be sold.

Vitarich was the biggest loser among commercial-industrial shares on Friday, shedding 25 centavos, or 8.20 percent, to close at 2.80 pesos.
