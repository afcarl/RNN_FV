<p>Chinese and U.S. negotiators have failed to resolve a multi-million dollar textile dispute after four days of talks in Beijing but have promised to resume discussions later this month.</p>
<p>A great deal remained to be resolved after the Beijing talks, which had aimed to reach a compromise on renewing bilateral textile agreements due to expire on December 31, the U.S. embassy in Beijing said in a statement.</p>
<p>Chinese trade officials and Washington's top textile negotiator Rita Hayes had also been wrangling over millions of dollars in penalties imposed by Washington on Chinese imports.</p>
<p>The United States last September slapped penalties worth $19 million on Chinese textiles, saying Beijing was shipping them through third countries to avoid quota restrictions.</p>
<p>China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks. The curbs are scheduled to go into effect on December 10.</p>
<p>&quot;Discussions were productive for both sides, but much work remains to be done,&quot; the U.S. embassy said of the talks which ended late on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The two delegations agreed to meet again later in the month in the United States to finalise their negotiations,&quot; it said but gave no details of whether the talks would be held before or after the Chinese deadline for retaliation.</p>
<p>China's huge textile sales to the United States have long been a sensitive point for U.S. trade negotiators eager to reduce Wasington's swelling trade deficit.</p>
<p>Washington said its 1995 trade deficit with China was $35 billion, making trade a major issue in ties already strained by disagreement over Taiwan, weapons sales, nuclear proliferation and copyright piracy.</p>
<p>Many Sino-U.S. trade negotiations have run up to, and sometimes beyond, deadlines for sanctions and punitive action, but trade conflict has usually been averted in the end.</p>
