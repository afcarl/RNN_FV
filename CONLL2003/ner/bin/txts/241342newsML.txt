KUALA LUMPUR 1996-12-06

Malaysia's tin price ended unchanged at 14.99 ringgit ($5.95) a kg on support from European and local buyers despite an overnight fall on the London Metal Exchange (LME), traders said.

"Some strong buying kept the price steady...otherwise the market would have followed the LME," said a trader.

Buyers and sellers matched positions for a final turnover of 92 tonnes against 83 on Thursday. The local price was trading at a premium of $20 against London, compared to a discount of $10 on Thursday.
