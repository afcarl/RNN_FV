<p>Taiwan share prices closed sharply down on Friday on news that a parliament panel passed a proposal to slash the stock investments of Taiwan's state labour insurance fund to five percent of its holdings from 30 percent.</p>
<p>The weighted index ended down 112.68 points or 1.63 percent at 6,806.81. Turnover was T$67.15 billion.</p>
<p>Sentiment was also hurt after Taiwan foreign minister John Chang, currently on a damage-control visit in South Africa, announed that Taiwan would recall its ambassador to Pretoria and immediately suspend all aid projects and treaties in protest at the breaking of diplomatic ties, brokers said.  </p>
<p>South African President Nelson Mandela announced on Novermber 27 that Pretoria, the biggest of Taiwan's 30 diplomatic allies, would switch ties to Beijing in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has already been in a consolidation phase after recent rally, so sentiment is easily to be dampened on labour insurance fund and South Africa news,&quot; said Chen Han-chung, research manager at Yungli Securities.</p>
<p>The panel's proposal on labour insurance fund would require approval by the full parliament to become binding but brokers said the full parliament was unlikely to act on the proposal over election concerns for local polls in 1997 and 1998.  </p>
<p>Plastics fell most after its recent surges, with Formosa Plastics down T$3.5 to T$67 and Nan Ya down T$3 to T$65.</p>
<p>Textile, paper, machinery and cement shares were also weak.</p>
<p>Electronics slowed their falls after recent downward corrections and would likely rebound soon, brokers said.</p>
<p>Computer giant Acer rose 50 cents to T$51.5 on local newspaper reports saying Morgan Stanley recommended a &quot;buy&quot; on</p>
<p>Brokers said they saw initial support at around 6,750, a three-month index average.</p>
