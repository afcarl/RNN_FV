<p>Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC) said on Friday it is planning an additional public offer worth 2.5 billion pesos next year.</p>
<p>In a statement submitted to the Philippine Stock Exchange, the bank said the public offer will be made after a rights offer expected to raise 2.0 billion pesos.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the bank announced it had set a one-for-7.55 stock rights to its shareholders at the price of 40.30 pesos per share.</p>
<p>The rights offer came after the bank got approval from the Central Bank on its 6.5 percent stock dividend, 800 percent stock dividend and a ten-to-one stock split. These are now pending with the Securities and Exchange Commission for its approval, the bank said.</p>
<p>The capital raising programme of RCBC is in line with the current trend in the banking industry to beef up capital amidst stiffer competition. In 1995, the local banking industry was opened to ten foreign banks.</p>
<p>Last week, the Central Bank had also set a new ruling requiring expanded commercial banks to have a minimum capital of 4.5 billion from the present 2.5 billion pesos. Listed banks will have two-and-a-half years to comply with the new requirement.</p>
<p>Expanded commercial banks are those which are allowed to invest in non-allied undertakings such as real estate and manufacturing.</p>
