HONG KONG 1996-12-06

Jiangling Motors Corp Ltd said on Friday it would develop a new line of automobiles in 1997 with Ford Motor Co to improve its competitive edge in the domestic market.

Jiangling and Ford would start producing the Transit series, newly designed by Ford, including buses, vans and trucks, the Shenzhen-listed firm said in a statement in the Shenzhen-based Securities Times.

Jiangling spokesman Xiong Zhongping told the China Securities Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based newsletter, that under the plan Jiangling and Ford would initially make buses, with Jiangling providing engines equipped with Japanese technology. Ford would provide the other parts and exterior design.

The buses would improve the competitiveness of Jiangling, which mainly makes light trucks, Xiong said. He gave no more details.

He said Jiangling would streamline management, upgrade production technology and increase light truck exports next year as part of its plan to reduce its exposure to increasingly intense competition in China.  

"Jiangling began exporting a small portion of its trucks to Egypt and the Middle East this year, which was fairly successful," Xiong said. "With Ford's help in technology and marketing, Jiangling will see its operations gradually improving in the coming years."

Jiangling's co-operation with Ford dates back to 1995, when Ford paid about US$40 million to buy 80 percent of Jiangling's issue of 174 million class B shares.

Jiangling also said in the statement that it planned to raise to $22.50 million its investment in its 75 percent-owned light truck venture with Isuzu of Japan.

This will increase the registered capital of Jiangling Isuzu Automobile Co Ltd to $30 million from US$20 million, with Isuzu still contributing 25 percent, it said.
