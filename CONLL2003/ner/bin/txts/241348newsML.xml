<p>Jiangling Motors Corp Ltd said on Friday it would develop a new line of automobiles in 1997 with Ford Motor Co to improve its competitive edge in the domestic market.</p>
<p>Jiangling and Ford would start producing the Transit series, newly designed by Ford, including buses, vans and trucks, the Shenzhen-listed firm said in a statement in the Shenzhen-based Securities Times.</p>
<p>Jiangling spokesman Xiong Zhongping told the China Securities Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based newsletter, that under the plan Jiangling and Ford would initially make buses, with Jiangling providing engines equipped with Japanese technology. Ford would provide the other parts and exterior design.</p>
<p>The buses would improve the competitiveness of Jiangling, which mainly makes light trucks, Xiong said. He gave no more details.</p>
<p>He said Jiangling would streamline management, upgrade production technology and increase light truck exports next year as part of its plan to reduce its exposure to increasingly intense competition in China.  </p>
<p>&quot;Jiangling began exporting a small portion of its trucks to Egypt and the Middle East this year, which was fairly successful,&quot; Xiong said. &quot;With Ford's help in technology and marketing, Jiangling will see its operations gradually improving in the coming years.&quot;</p>
<p>Jiangling's co-operation with Ford dates back to 1995, when Ford paid about US$40 million to buy 80 percent of Jiangling's issue of 174 million class B shares.</p>
<p>Jiangling also said in the statement that it planned to raise to $22.50 million its investment in its 75 percent-owned light truck venture with Isuzu of Japan.</p>
<p>This will increase the registered capital of Jiangling Isuzu Automobile Co Ltd to $30 million from US$20 million, with Isuzu still contributing 25 percent, it said.</p>
