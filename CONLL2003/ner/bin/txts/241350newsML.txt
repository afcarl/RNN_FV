Yuan closes up at three-week high vs dollar.

SHANGHAI 1996-12-06

The Chinese yuan rose above the key 8.3000 level to close at a three-week high of 8.2985 against the U.S. dollar from Thursday's 8.3013 in the interbank foreign exchange market in Shanghai, traders said.

Dealers said that active bids pushed the yuan up late in the session but that it will not be able to maintain its upward momentum next week.

The yuan opened slightly higher at 8.3006 and fell to an intra-day low of 8.3011. It then moved up steadily to breach the 8.3000 level before ending at an intra-day high.

Trading was active, with most done at 8.3005, traders said.  

"Ahead of the weekend, less selling gave the buyers the chance to push the yuan up," one dealer said.

"The central bank was seen intervening little to cap the yuan, which suggested that it wanted the price to fluctuate in order to make the market a little more active," he added.

"But the rise before the end will have no impact on its movements early next week," a second dealer said.

He expects the yuan to fall below 8.3000 next Monday.

The yuan closed up slightly at 7.3513 from 7.3700 against 100 Japanese yen and up at 1.0740 from 1.0743 against the Hong Kong dollar.
