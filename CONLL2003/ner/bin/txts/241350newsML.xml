<p>The Chinese yuan rose above the key 8.3000 level to close at a three-week high of 8.2985 against the U.S. dollar from Thursday's 8.3013 in the interbank foreign exchange market in Shanghai, traders said.</p>
<p>Dealers said that active bids pushed the yuan up late in the session but that it will not be able to maintain its upward momentum next week.</p>
<p>The yuan opened slightly higher at 8.3006 and fell to an intra-day low of 8.3011. It then moved up steadily to breach the 8.3000 level before ending at an intra-day high.</p>
<p>Trading was active, with most done at 8.3005, traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Ahead of the weekend, less selling gave the buyers the chance to push the yuan up,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank was seen intervening little to cap the yuan, which suggested that it wanted the price to fluctuate in order to make the market a little more active,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;But the rise before the end will have no impact on its movements early next week,&quot; a second dealer said.</p>
<p>He expects the yuan to fall below 8.3000 next Monday.</p>
<p>The yuan closed up slightly at 7.3513 from 7.3700 against 100 Japanese yen and up at 1.0740 from 1.0743 against the Hong Kong dollar.</p>
