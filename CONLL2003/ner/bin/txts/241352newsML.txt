Poultry firm Vitarich Corp said on Friday its board had approved a plan to sell non-essential assets to finance the company's working capital and expansion programmes.

Counsel Tadeo Hilado told the Philippine Stock Exchange the assets sale would raise about 400 million to 600 million pesos for the company.

He did not specify which assets would be disposed.

Vitarich was the biggest loser among commercial-industrial shares on Friday, shedding 25 centavos, or 8.20 percent, to close at 2.80 pesos.- Manila newsroom 63 2 8418938 Fax 8176267
