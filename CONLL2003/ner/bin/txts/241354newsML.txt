SEOUL 1996-12-06

The Daewoo Group was holding an emergency meeting on Friday with the heads of the conglomerate's affiliates to discuss its further plans to buy France's Thomson Multimedia, analysts and Yonhap news agency said.

"We know that the meeting is going on right now," said Bruce Gonyea, Paribas Capital Market's regional electronics analyst in Singapore. "They are very disappointed at the moment, but are determined that this deal go through."

Daewoo Group officials were unavailable for comment.

On Wednesday, the French government backed away from its decision to allow part of the state-owned electronics giant Thomson SA to be sold to Daewoo Electronics Co Ltd.

Under the plan, France was to have sold loss-making Thomson to electronics group Lagardere for a symbolic one franc. Lagardere in turn planned to sell Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo, also for just one franc.
