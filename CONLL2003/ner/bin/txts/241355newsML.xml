<p>China may be buying back some of the copper it has shipped to Singapore within the last month after prices of the red metal tumbled on the London Metal Exchange (LME), Far East metal traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think some of the material is moving back to China,&quot; the general manager of a Japanese metal trading company told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Some 10,000 tonnes was moved to Singapore from China last week. Some more material came in this week but that has now stopped,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>But other traders were more cautious.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd be slightly surprised,&quot; a dealer for a European metal trading firm said. &quot;It's obviously plausible, but the market has not come down that much to make it economically feasible.&quot;</p>
<p>Three month copper closed on Thursday on the LME at US$2,187 a tonne. Earlier this month, copper climbed above $2,200 a tonne before stalling at that level. The red metal was quoted here by dealers at $2,185/90 a tonne at 0300 GMT.</p>
<p>Some 5,000-7,000 tonnes of copper arrived in Singapore this week and an estimated 20,000 tonnes of metal are warehouses here.  </p>
<p>U.K.-based Bloomsbury Mineral Economics (BME) analyst Peter Hollands said in its monthly report on Thursday that a tidal flow of 200,000 tonnes of copper may be going backwards and forwards between LME and Chinese bonded warehouses.</p>
<p>BME said that various Chinese agencies acquired a stockpile of 200,000 tonnes of refined copper in early 1994, some of this metal had been sold off in tranches of about 85,000 tonnes and subsequently re-purchased.</p>
<p>LME copper stocks recently touched six-year lows of a little over 90,000 tonnes, having dropped from end-August 1996 levels of 275,000 tonnes.  </p>
<p>The BME report said &quot;at least half and possibly over three-quarters of the LME stock drawdown represents relocation to the Chinese reserve, we believe.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said copper prices on Friday afternoon will respond to leads provided by the LME report due out at 0900 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;It (copper) seems a little bit stuck in a range between $2,180 to $2,200 a tonne,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Far Easy metal dealers expect copper to post an increase of 1,000-3,000 tonnes and aluminium to slip by 500-2,000 tonnes.  </p>
<p>&quot;I don't think copper will go up 10,000 tonnes,&quot; a dealer said, referring to speculation overnight in New York by some traders that stocks will rise by that much. &quot;A small increase is &quot;I think prices will go down if stocks go up, but it's going to be slow for a while,&quot; a dealer for a Singapore-based metal firm said.</p>
<p>Physical base metal business around Asia was thin ahead of the Christmas holiday period, the traders said.  </p>
<p>India and Taiwan recently bought between four to six lots of zinc amounting to about 125 tonnes each, but the copper and aluminium trade was quiet, a dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's really no huge demand. It's almost non-existent. We're not getting much inquiries this month,&quot; a zinc dealer for a U.S. company said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not seeing much buying interest from other Asian countries. It's the end of the year and no one wants to set the world alight,&quot; another trader said.  </p>
<p>A Japanese dealer said most of the trade was concentrating on ongoing negotiations for premiums on long-term supply contracts in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now talking about long-term copper contracts for Taiwan and other countries around the region,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Premiums for copper and other base metals eased further in Singapore because of ample stocks and slack demand.</p>
<p>&quot;There's so much copper in non-LME warehouses,&quot; one trader said. &quot;We offered copper at a premium of $20 and no one wanted to do anything.&quot;</p>
<p>Singapore indications as a premium to LME cash in US$/tonne:  </p>
<p>						   Dec 6	  Nov 29</p>
<p>    Aluminium (Western)		    +55-70	 +70-75</p>
<p>    Aluminium (Indian)		     +55-70	 +70-75</p>
<p>    Aluminium (Russian)		    +45-50	 +60-65</p>
<p>    Aluminium (Indonesian)		 +45-50	 +60-65</p>
<p>    Copper				     +20-40	 +30-60</p>
<p>    Zinc					 +20	    +20-40</p>
<p>    Lead					 +10-15	 +10-20</p>
