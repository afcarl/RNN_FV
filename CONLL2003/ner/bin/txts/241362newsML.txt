Seoul plans refugee camp for N.Koreans next year. [CORRECTED 09:10 GMT]

SEOUL 1996-12-06

One day after announcing the biggest mass defection from North Korea, neighbouring South Korea said on Friday it would build its first camp next year to cope with a possible exodus of refugees from the communist nation.

An official (Corrects from "spokesman") of the Unification Ministry, which deals with inter-Korean matters, said the first of what was likely to be a number of camps would hold up to 500 refugees.

South Korea announced on Thursday that 17 North Koreans -- 16 members of one family and a security guard -- fled through China to Hong Kong where they were waiting for asylum in South Korea.

It was the biggest-ever single flight from North Korea and set off alarm bells in Seoul that North Korea's deteriorating food and economic situation might soon become so dire that there would be a mass exodus.

South Korea has long had plans to cope with a North Korean exodus that included building refugee camps but it was the first time a construction date had been set.

The official (Corrects from "spokesman") told reporters that as well as providing food and shelter, refugees would receive job training at the camp to prepare them for life in the more-modern South.

South Korean officials have for several years been concerned at how they would handle a refugee tide similiar to the exodus that resulted from the collapse of East Germany (Corrects sentence to rephrase North-South antagonism.)

South and North Korea have been technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace pact.

About 600 North Korean defectors are now living in the South. In recent months arrivals have been seen to rise as chronic food shortages bite into the lives of the population.

International relief agencies report peasants in the North are scrounging for tree bark, grass and edible roots in their search for food because of failure of crops for two years running from heavy rain.
