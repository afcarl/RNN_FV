South Korea to sell 6.92 mln Korea Telecom shares.

SEOUL 1996-12-06

The South Korean government plans to sell 6.92 million Korea Telecom shares valued at about 260 billion won in an auction on December 12 and 13, a Finance Ministry official said on Friday.  

The official said the auction represents 2.4 percent of the state-run telephone service provider's outstanding shares. The minimum bid was set at 37,600 won per share.

Institutions and corporations would be eligible to bid for the shares, but individual investors would be excluded to minimise the impact on the stock market, he said.

Outcome of the auction will be released on December 17.

The ministry has said Korea Telecom would be listed in the first half of next year. Korea Telecom has a monopoly on the local telephone service, and has the lion's share of the country's long-distance and data communications markets.
