SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Singapore's Creative Technology Ltd said it had entered into partnerships with four U.S.-based companies to develop, integrate and distribute technologies for sound, audio, graphics, games and commerce over the Internet.

The four are Progressive Networks, Total Entertainment Network (TEN), VDOnet Corp and Wave Systems Corp.

Creative said in a statement late on Thursday that under the agreement, it would include Progressive's RealAudio software programme with its multimedia products. RealAudio plays "live" and on-demand audio over the Internet.

Creative would offer customers Internet games from TEN and VDOnet's flagship video product VDOLive, which allows access to real-time video on the Internet.

With Wave's security technology for commerce, Creative's customers can buy entertainment and educational multimedia software and other digital contents over the Internet.

Creative said in another statement it had developed a prototype technology that integrates audio, video, 3D graphics and electronic commerce into a single Internet multimedia application, codenamed Passport. This reduces time spent on searches and browsing, it said.
