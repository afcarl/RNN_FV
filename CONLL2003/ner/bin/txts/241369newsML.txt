India tenders to buy 1-pct sulphur diesel for Feb.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) has issued a tender to buy 1 percent sulphur high speed diesel for delivery in February, industry sources said on Friday.

Unlike previous tenders, IOC has not requested for any 0.5 percent sulphur diesel.

The tender seeks 30,000 and 45,0000 tonnes cargoes for delivery to Goa or Kandla on the West Coast and Madras or Haldia on the East Coast on a cost-and-freight basis.

The tender closes on December 18 and offers will be valid until December 20.  

Traders said that IOC's decision to buy only 1 percent sulphur diesel was due to the high stocks of these cargoes in the Middle East and as a result IOC was hoping it would be able to receive cheaper offers in its tender.

IOC bought only 1 percent sulphur diesel in its January arrival purchase tender amounting to 255,000 tonnes.

Last week, the company issued a supplementary tender to buy 0.5 percent sulphur diesel for delivery to the west coast. This tender closes on December 11 and offers should be valid until December 13.  

Traders said IOC may not issue a supplementary tender for 0.5 percent sulphur diesel for February arrival.
