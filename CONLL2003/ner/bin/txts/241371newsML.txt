SHANGHAI 1996-12-06

The manager of a Shanghai investment company office has pleaded guilty to large-scale fraud and stock speculation using public funds, the Shanghai Securities News said on Friday.

Song Weiguo, former manager of the Shanghai branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Shandong Trust and Investment Co, used 210 million yuan in company funds to speculate in stocks between 1993 and 1995.

A total of 3.129 million yuan in losses could not be retrieved, the newspaper said.

Song also used false pretences to gain loans valued at 14.5 million yuan, it said.

He fled Shanghai after his case was uncovered and was caught early this year in the southern province of Guangxi during an anti-crime sweep, it said.

The newspaper said the Shanghai First People's Court would shortly announce a sentence. Given the sums involved, Song could face the death penalty.
