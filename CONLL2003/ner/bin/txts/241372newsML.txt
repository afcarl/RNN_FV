BEIJING 1996-12-06

China said it would set up the Lianyungang Nuclear Power Co Ltd in the first quarter of next year to operate a nuclear power plant built with Russian technology.

China National Nuclear Corp will have a 50 percent share in the company which will manage the plant at Pashantou, near the city of Lianyungang in the eastern province of Jiangsu, the official Xinhua news agency said late on Thursday.

Jiangsu International Trust and Investment Corp will hold 20 percent, Jiangsu Provincial Electricity Co 20 percent and East China Electric Power Group 10 percent, the agency said.

The parties signed an agreement on the shareholdings at a ceremony for the opening of an office to prepare for the project, Xinhua said.

Construction of the multi-billion dollar plant, which calls for the installation of two 1,000-megawatt pressurised water reactors, will begin in 1998 and be completed in 2004.

Russia has offered $2 billion worth of 15-year low-interest loans to support the project.
