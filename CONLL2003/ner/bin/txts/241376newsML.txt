Hiroshima dome named heritage site despite U.S..

TOKYO 1996-12-06

The A-Bomb Dome in Hiroshima, a building symbolising the world's first atomic bombing, has been named a world heritage site despite opposition from the United States, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said on Friday.

The ministry said that the World Heritage Committee approved the decision on Thursday at a meeting in Merida, Mexico.

It will be the second site related to World War Two to be named a World Heritage site after the concentration camp complex at Auschwitz in Poland, the scene of Nazi gas-massacres of interned Jews.

Formerly known as the Hiroshima Industrial Promotion Hall, the Czech-designed building was near the epicentre of the bomb dropped by the United States on August 6, 1945, which killed more than 140,000 people.

The dome and the main structure, located just across a river from the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, survived the blast and since then have come to symbolise the bombing.

In Washington on Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said: "The United States will not support the inclusion of Hiroshima as a site on this list -- essentially because we have made the decision that we don't believe that war-related sites are within the scope of the convention."

Hiroshima Mayor Takeshi Hiraoka welcomed the decision, saying the building was historically important.

"The A-Bomb Dome is a witness to mankind's first atomic bombing," Hiraoka said on Friday. "It is important that it has been accepted internationally."

The atomic bombing of Hiroshima still sparks controversy in U.S.-Japan ties.

Last year, U.S. war veterans objected to a planned exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington to mark the 50th anniversary of the ending of World War Two.

The exhibit was eventually scaled down to show only the fuselage of the Enola Gay, the U.S. B-29 bomber that actually dropped the bomb, and other displays regarding the military operation, but it included no details about the victims of the attack.

A second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki three days after Hiroshima. Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945.
