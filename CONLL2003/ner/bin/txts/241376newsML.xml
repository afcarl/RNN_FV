<title>JAPAN: Hiroshima dome named heritage site despite U.S..</title>

<p>The A-Bomb Dome in Hiroshima, a building symbolising the world's first atomic bombing, has been named a world heritage site despite opposition from the United States, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>The ministry said that the World Heritage Committee approved the decision on Thursday at a meeting in Merida, Mexico.</p>
<p>It will be the second site related to World War Two to be named a World Heritage site after the concentration camp complex at Auschwitz in Poland, the scene of Nazi gas-massacres of interned Jews.</p>
<p>Formerly known as the Hiroshima Industrial Promotion Hall, the Czech-designed building was near the epicentre of the bomb dropped by the United States on August 6, 1945, which killed more than 140,000 people.</p>
<p>The dome and the main structure, located just across a river from the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, survived the blast and since then have come to symbolise the bombing.</p>
<p>In Washington on Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said: &quot;The United States will not support the inclusion of Hiroshima as a site on this list -- essentially because we have made the decision that we don't believe that war-related sites are within the scope of the convention.&quot;</p>
<p>Hiroshima Mayor Takeshi Hiraoka welcomed the decision, saying the building was historically important.</p>
<p>&quot;The A-Bomb Dome is a witness to mankind's first atomic bombing,&quot; Hiraoka said on Friday. &quot;It is important that it has been accepted internationally.&quot;</p>
<p>The atomic bombing of Hiroshima still sparks controversy in U.S.-Japan ties.</p>
<p>Last year, U.S. war veterans objected to a planned exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington to mark the 50th anniversary of the ending of World War Two.</p>
<p>The exhibit was eventually scaled down to show only the fuselage of the Enola Gay, the U.S. B-29 bomber that actually dropped the bomb, and other displays regarding the military operation, but it included no details about the victims of the attack.</p>
<p>A second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki three days after Hiroshima. Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945.</p>
