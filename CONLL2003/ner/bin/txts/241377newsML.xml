<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan deputies seek to curb state's stock holding.</title>
<headline>Taiwan deputies seek to curb state's stock holding.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>A parliament group has passed a non-binding proposal that would slash the stock investments of Taiwan's huge state labour insurance fund to five percent of its total holdings from 30 percent, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The Council of Labour Affairs, a cabinet body that oversees the T$188 billion labour fund, said an ad-hoc committee of Legislative Yuan dissidents had passed the proposal but that it would have no force unless adopted by the full parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;The subcommittee's decision has no legal power to restrict our investment,&quot; a council spokeswoman said by telephone. &quot;It's only a reference for us.&quot;</p>
<p>It was not immediately known when or if the full parliament would review the proposal, drafted by a non-standing group of Legislative Yuan lawmakers. But with a 51 percent majority, the ruling Nationalists could be expected to defeat it.</p>
<p>The dissident lawmakers' move was interpreted by market watchers as a political attempt to limit the Nationalists' ability to influence the stock market.</p>
<p>A dramatic late-November rally was widely seen by analysts as having been engineered by the state with political motives and carried out through use of the labour insurance fund and other major state funds.  </p>
<p>The main index surged more than 400 points in late November but has lost about half of those gains in December.</p>
<p>In early November, the cabinet sharply increased the state's stock market clout by adopting a proposal to allow the state labour insurance fund and state pension fund to invest up to 30 percent of their holdings on the island's stock market.</p>
<p>Before the change, the labour insurance fund had been barred from investing in stocks and the pension fund had been allowed to hold only 10 percent of its value in stocks.</p>
<p>Under the 30 percent limit, the labour insurance fund can invest up to T$56.4 billion in stocks.</p>
<p>Under the proposed five percent cap, this would fall to just T$9.4 billion.</p>
