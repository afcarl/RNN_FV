Philrealty falls 11.90 pct to 1.48 pesos.

MANILA 1996-12-06

Shares of Philippine Realty and Holdings Corp fell 20 centavos, or 11.90 percent, to 1.48 pesos on profit taking at mid-session on Friday, brokers said.

The real estate developer had been rising in the past two months, hitting a high 1.98 pesos last Tuesday from only 1.10 by the end of October, on speculations that a big construction company was slowly buying into the company.

The company has rejected the rumour.  

"It's just being attacked by profit-takers. It had doubled its price in the past months," Ramon Borja, an analyst at Dharmala Securities, said.

Philrealty was the most actively traded stock by midsession with 25.8 million shares changing hands in one hour.

He said investors were shifting to blue chip issues to beef up their portfolio for year-end window dressing.
