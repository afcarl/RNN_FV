<p>Copper stocks on the London Metal Exchange (LME) will probably post a modest rise of between 1,000-3,000 tonnes while aluminium should decline by 500-2,000 tonnes, base metal traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think copper will go up 10,000 tonnes,&quot; a dealer said, referring to speculation overnight in New York by some traders that stocks will rise by that much. &quot;A small increase is Another trader said the movement of material has slowed down between Chinese bonded warehouses and those in Singapore after LME prices fell. The LME stocks report is due out at 0900 GMT.  </p>
<p>&quot;I believe copper should go up a little, but not much,&quot; the general manager of a Japanese metal trading house said.</p>
<p>Around 5,000 to 7,000 tonnes of copper arrived in Singapore this week against an estimated 10,000 tonnes the previous week.</p>
<p>There was no reason then to put the material on warrant and there is no reason now to put it on warrant either,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Traders estimate the total quantity of copper in Singapore warehouses at about 20,000 tonnes.  </p>
<p>The amount of copper in the LME's Singapore warehouse on warrant reached reached 12,500 tonnes on Tuesday, up 250 tonnes from the previous Friday according to the exchange's figures.</p>
<p>Three month copper price was quoted by Singapore metal dealers at around US$2,185/90 a tonne at 0200 GMT against late trade in London on Thursday of $2,187 a tonne.</p>
<p>Aluminium was priced at around $1,523/28 a tonne at 0200 GMT, almost unchanged from the London trade of a shade above $1,520 a tonne, dealers said.</p>
