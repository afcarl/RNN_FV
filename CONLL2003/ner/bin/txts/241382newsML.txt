China punishes 28 firms for securities abuses.

SHANGHAI 1996-12-06

The Chinese securities authorities have punished 28 firms for illegal activities in share issues, including many subsidiaries of the country's main state banks, the China Securities newspaper reported on Friday.

It was the biggest case ever reported of wrong-doing by securities firms in the six-year history of modern China's stock markets.

The newspaper said the firms broke the rules in the share issues of two companies in September, using funds obtained on credit in contravention of the regulations to bid for shares.

One of the firms, the Huayin International Trust and Investment Co, used 2.2 billion yuan credit to bid for shares, while two subsidiaries of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) used credit of 2.5 billion yuan for the same purpose.

China's securities rules ban the use of credit for bidding for shares to be listed.

Companies involved also included subsidiaries of the Bank of China, Shenyin & Wangui Securities, the Agricultural Bank of China and the China People's Insurance Company.  

The newspaper said six of the companies were fined, the heaviest fine being 1.1 million yuan levied against Huayin Trust and Investment Co. The rest were given serious warnings. Many will undergo compulsory "reorganisation".

"The activities of these 28 companies have contravened the national regulations on financial management and seriously interfered with the good order of the securities markets," the China Securities Regulatory Commission said in a report.

Several similar cases have been publicised in recent weeks as the Chinese authorities continue their campaign to clean up and standardise the securities industry.
