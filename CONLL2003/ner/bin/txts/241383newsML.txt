TOP STORIES

- Deputy Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej has threatened to leave the coalition government, saying his Prachakorn Thai Party was not given enough power to deal with Bangkok's traffic problems. Samak's threat came after Interior Minister Snoh Thienthong on Wednesday released details of ministerial duties to be shared by his five deputies, which included his surprising decision to personally supervise the Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand.

- A slew of unanswered questions remain concerning the route of the Yadana gas pipeline in Kanchanaburi province, as environmentalists fear it may affect the only known habitats of a rare crab species and one of the world's smallest and most endangered mammals: the Kitti's hog-nosed bat. Kanchanaburi residents are also upset that the pipeline will pass through rich forests - a route apparently chosen to avoid militarily-sensitive border regions. (THE NATION)

-  Interior Minister Snoh Thienthong has ruled out the possibility of allowing military personnel to make arrests following Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's proposal to seek their help in the battle against drugs. Snoh says the Interior Ministry instead wants enlisted personnel to provide information about the military's possible involvement in the drug trade, as most police are reluctant to investigate the matter.
