China tightens control of listed firm info release.

SHANGHAI 1996-12-06

China has ordered its two stock exchanges to tighten controls on information released by listed firms and to monitor the accuracy of the announcements, the Shanghai Securities News said on Friday.

Under the new rules, the exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen must check that announcements made by companies have received official approval before they are issued, the newspaper said.

"Announcements by listed firms must be checked by the exchanges and no designated newspapers and magazines can publish them without the exchange's approval," it said.

The newspaper said the rules were aimed at standardising the release of information by listed firms in order to maintain order on the exchanges and to protect investor interests.

The rules said government approval documents need to be presented if a listed firm's announcement concerns the transfer of state shares, takeovers and mergers or the foreign acquisition of Chinese listed firms' shares.

The rules also cover announcements on the firms' annual reports, interim results, prospectuses and statements on rights issues.  

Announcements related to issue of convertible bonds, listing of new shares and changes in the category of shares must be approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), not by the bourses, the rules said.

Listed companies are specifically banned from using news conferences or news interviews as a substitute for official announcements, the rules said.

The rules require the exchanges to report to the CSRC any cases that violate the rules, but did not say what punishment would be imposed on violators.
