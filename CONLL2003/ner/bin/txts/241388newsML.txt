Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) may not be broken up until the 1999/2000 business year as preparations will take at least two years after the establishment of laws necessary for the break-up, a government official said on Friday.  

The law regarding the realignment of NTT will be established in the summer of 1997 at the earliest.

NTT's international service will thus be limited within the scope of its current business until the realignment, Masahito Tani, Posts and Telecommunications Ministry bureau chief, told a news conference.

"We have so far no plan to take a special measure regarding NTT's international service in the meantime," Tani said. "NTT will prepare for international operations, and do what it can do under the current law until a long-distance company emerges through the realignment."  

Tani said the new holding company will own 100 percent of the shares in the three smaller NTT firms -- one long-distance call firm and two regional phone companies.

"We so far have no plan to list the shares in the three companies," Tani said.

Existing NTT shareholders, including the Ministry of Finance, will own shares in the holding company, Tani said.

There is no change in the existing government plan to sell NTT shares, Tani said.

Tani said the split up of NTT under a holding company would have no negative impact on NTT share prices.  

"In total, NTT's flexibility has increased, while its business is united under a group system. The new structure will not have an adverse impact on NTT's share price," he said.

Tani added, however, that NTT's new structure would allow limited competition in Japan's telecommunications market.

"We wanted to decide on structural issues regarding NTT as soon as possible, because technology trends and global market conditions are changing rapidly."

Tani said partial competition within a group was not impossible under a holding company scheme.

Posts and Telecommunications Minister Hisao Horinouchi told reporters on Friday that the government plans to split NTT into three firms under a holding company.
