<p>Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) may not be broken up until the 1999/2000 business year as preparations will take at least two years after the establishment of laws necessary for the break-up, a government official said on Friday.  </p>
<p>The law regarding the realignment of NTT will be established in the summer of 1997 at the earliest.</p>
<p>NTT's international service will thus be limited within the scope of its current business until the realignment, Masahito Tani, Posts and Telecommunications Ministry bureau chief, told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We have so far no plan to take a special measure regarding NTT's international service in the meantime,&quot; Tani said. &quot;NTT will prepare for international operations, and do what it can do under the current law until a long-distance company emerges through the realignment.&quot;  </p>
<p>Tani said the new holding company will own 100 percent of the shares in the three smaller NTT firms -- one long-distance call firm and two regional phone companies.</p>
<p>&quot;We so far have no plan to list the shares in the three companies,&quot; Tani said.</p>
<p>Existing NTT shareholders, including the Ministry of Finance, will own shares in the holding company, Tani said.</p>
<p>There is no change in the existing government plan to sell NTT shares, Tani said.</p>
<p>Tani said the split up of NTT under a holding company would have no negative impact on NTT share prices.  </p>
<p>&quot;In total, NTT's flexibility has increased, while its business is united under a group system. The new structure will not have an adverse impact on NTT's share price,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tani added, however, that NTT's new structure would allow limited competition in Japan's telecommunications market.</p>
<p>&quot;We wanted to decide on structural issues regarding NTT as soon as possible, because technology trends and global market conditions are changing rapidly.&quot;</p>
<p>Tani said partial competition within a group was not impossible under a holding company scheme.</p>
<p>Posts and Telecommunications Minister Hisao Horinouchi told reporters on Friday that the government plans to split NTT into three firms under a holding company.</p>
