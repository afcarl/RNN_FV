Japan PM says seeks separate bank regulatory body.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Friday reiterated his view that the functions of inspecting and supervising financial institutions should be separated from the Finance Ministry.

"I don't think the new body would belong to the Finance Ministry," Hashimoto told the key budget committee of the Lower House of parliament.

He added that he expected his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and two other parties forming a loose alliance with it, to decide to let the new body supervise all financial institutions, which would include not only banks but also agricultural financial institutions.
