HONG KONG 1996-12-06

General Motors Corp unit Opel has emerged as front runner to take a stake in Denway Investment Ltd's Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile Co joint venture in China, the South China Morning Post reported on Friday.

Citing industry sources, the newspaper said Opel had been lobbying hard to become the new partner for the car-making venture in Guangzhou in southern China, and had opened a representative office in Guangzhou to further its effort.

Peugeot Automobiles, a divison of the PSA Peugeot Citroen group, said on Thursday it was studying the possibility of concentrating its production in China in one plant from two currently. A French newspaper said Peugeot may pull out of Guangzhou, where it produces 505 and 504 models.

The South China Morning Post said Ford Motor Co, BMW AG and Hyundai Motor Co Ltd are also said to be interested in the venture.

The Chinese government has placed a temporary ban on any new car manufacturing joint ventures and the only way to get into the Chinese market is by buying into existing car makers, the newspaper said.

Denway and General Motors officials were not immediately available for comment. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6370
