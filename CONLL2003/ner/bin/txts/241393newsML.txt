Japan MOF wants right as NTT shareholder upheld.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said on Friday that he hopes the ministry's right as a large shareholder in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp will be upheld.

"I have not yet heard the final report from the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry. However, we hope our right as a shareholder will be sufficiently secured as the ministry holds a large amount of shares in the company," Mitsuzuka told a regular news conference.

Posts and Telecommunications Minister Hisao Horinouchi said on Friday that the government plans to split NTT into three firms under a holding company, with one of the new companies becoming a long-distance operator and the other two local-call operators.

Concerning the issue of whether to introduce a system of taxing companies on a consolidated basis, Mitsuzuka said the issue should be studied from a viewpoint of fairness and neutrality.
