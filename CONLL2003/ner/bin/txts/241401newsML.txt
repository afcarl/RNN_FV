Fuji Electric Co Ltd said on Friday that it hopes to agree to a technological tie up with British power company Magnox Electric Plc on decommissioning nuclear power plants.

A company spokesman declined to elaborate.

The Nihon Keizai Shimbun said on Friday that Fuji Electric hopes to use the technology to decommission a nuclear reactor in Ibaraki prefecture, which will be the first commercial nuclear power plant in Japan to be closed.

The plant begun operating in July 1966 and is expected to be shut down by March, the paper said.
