TOKYO 1996-12-06

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp shares were higher on early morning Friday after the Post and Telecommunications Ministry said the company would be restructured into one long-distance company and two local-call firms.

As of 0014 GMT, the shares were up 17,000 yen at 847,000 yen as investors welcomed the news, brokers said.  

The ministry said Japan's telephone giant will be broken up into three groups under a single holding company, and will be allowed to offer international phone services for the first time.

In a statement, the ministry also said that the new holding company would hold all shares of the three new companies, while carrying out basic research and development businesses.

The new long-distance call company would be set up as a private company and the two local call companies would be set up as special companies which have the duty to ensure phone lines in areas they cover, it said.

An NTT official told Reuters that the timing of the breakup has not been determined yet and that more discussion with government officials was needed.

The firm is currently owned two-thirds by the government and dominates the domestic phone market with an 80 percent share of the business.
