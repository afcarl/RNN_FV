<p>Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp shares were higher on early morning Friday after the Post and Telecommunications Ministry said the company would be restructured into one long-distance company and two local-call firms.</p>
<p>As of 0014 GMT, the shares were up 17,000 yen at 847,000 yen as investors welcomed the news, brokers said.  </p>
<p>The ministry said Japan's telephone giant will be broken up into three groups under a single holding company, and will be allowed to offer international phone services for the first time.</p>
<p>In a statement, the ministry also said that the new holding company would hold all shares of the three new companies, while carrying out basic research and development businesses.</p>
<p>The new long-distance call company would be set up as a private company and the two local call companies would be set up as special companies which have the duty to ensure phone lines in areas they cover, it said.</p>
<p>An NTT official told Reuters that the timing of the breakup has not been determined yet and that more discussion with government officials was needed.</p>
<p>The firm is currently owned two-thirds by the government and dominates the domestic phone market with an 80 percent share of the business.</p>
