TOKYO 1996-12-06

Japan will work to settle its dispute with the United States over how to deregulate Tokyo's insurance market during bilateral ministerial talks which start on Friday, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said.

"We will make our best efforts to settle the issue by around noon on December 7," Mitsuzuka told a news conference.

Mitsuzuka is due to meet U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky in Tokyo starting this evening for bilateral talks on opening up Japan's insurance market. The round of talks is expected to last until Saturday afternoon.

"I don't think there are any barriers in bilateral relationships between Japan and the United States. I will tell her (Barshefsky) honestly, as the representative of the Japanese government, about the issue and ask for the U.S. side's understanding," he said.
