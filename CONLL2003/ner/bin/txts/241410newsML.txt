Japan says to split NTT into three firms.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

The Japanese government plans to split Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) into three firms under a holding company, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Hisao Horinouchi told reporters on Friday.  

One of the new companies will be a long-distance operator and the other two will be local-call operators, Horinouchi said.

One of the local firms will operate in western Japan and the other in eastern Japan, while the long-distance operator would be allowed to offer international services as well as domestic long-distance calls, he said.

Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he hopes NTT will offer international telecommunications services as soon as possible, Horinouchi said.

The government, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and two other parties in a close alliance with the LDP will work to submit the necessary bills to the parliament session beginning in January, he said.

"I'm happy that we reached an agreement which took into account the suggestions made by the ministry's panel," Horinouchi said.

The panel proposed in February that NTT, which controls 80 percent of Japan's telecommunications market, be broken up into three companies.  

In a statement, the ministry also said the holding company should hold all the shares in the new long-distance call company and two local-call operators, and also carry out basic research and development activities.

The new long-distance call operator would be set up as a private company. The two local call companies would be set up as special companies which have the duty of ensuring there are phone services in the regions they cover.

To implement the new NTT structure, the government will make the necessary adjustments in regulations such as the anti-monopoly and commercial laws, and mull possible special taxation measures, it said.
