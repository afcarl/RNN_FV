<p>The Japanese government plans to split Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) into three firms under a holding company, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Hisao Horinouchi told reporters on Friday.  </p>
<p>One of the new companies will be a long-distance operator and the other two will be local-call operators, Horinouchi said.</p>
<p>One of the local firms will operate in western Japan and the other in eastern Japan, while the long-distance operator would be allowed to offer international services as well as domestic long-distance calls, he said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he hopes NTT will offer international telecommunications services as soon as possible, Horinouchi said.</p>
<p>The government, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and two other parties in a close alliance with the LDP will work to submit the necessary bills to the parliament session beginning in January, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm happy that we reached an agreement which took into account the suggestions made by the ministry's panel,&quot; Horinouchi said.</p>
<p>The panel proposed in February that NTT, which controls 80 percent of Japan's telecommunications market, be broken up into three companies.  </p>
<p>In a statement, the ministry also said the holding company should hold all the shares in the new long-distance call company and two local-call operators, and also carry out basic research and development activities.</p>
<p>The new long-distance call operator would be set up as a private company. The two local call companies would be set up as special companies which have the duty of ensuring there are phone services in the regions they cover.</p>
<p>To implement the new NTT structure, the government will make the necessary adjustments in regulations such as the anti-monopoly and commercial laws, and mull possible special taxation measures, it said.</p>
