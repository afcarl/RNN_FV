Turkish exports rose 4.4 percent to $21.333 billion in the first 11 months of the year from $20.434 billion in the same 1995 period, the Turkish Exporters' Assembly (TIM) said in a statement on Friday.

It said November exports rose 4.8 percent to $2.261 billion from $2.158 billion a year ago.

TIM chairman Okan Oguz said a continuing slide in the leading readywear exports were due to negative conditions in European markets as well as delay in bringing Turkey's export regulations in line with the customs union with the European Union which took effect in January.

Readywear exports fell 7.9 percent in November to $579 million and 9.4 percent in the 11-month period to $5.66 billion, according to TIM data.

Iron and steel and metal industry exports firmed 3.8 percent to $2.57 billion, textile and related raw material exports rose 8.3 percent to $2.30 billion, electric-electronic exports jumped 33 percent to $1.71 billion in January-November when compared to the same 1995 period, TIM said.
