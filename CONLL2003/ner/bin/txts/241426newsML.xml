<title>ISRAEL: Moratinos to tell Syria that Israel wants talks.</title>
<headline>Moratinos to tell Syria that Israel wants talks.</headline>
<dateline>JERUSALEM 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>The European Union's Middle East envoy said in an interview published on Friday he would tell Syria on his first peace shuttle this weekend that Israel wants to renew talks.</p>
<p>Israel's Haaretz daily quoted Miguel Angel Moratinos, who is also Spain's ambassador to Israel, as saying he would deliver a message that &quot;Israel is interested in renewing the negotiations with Syria and in easing the tension between the two states&quot;.</p>
<p>Moratinos, appointed in October, began his mission on Thursday by meeting Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and holding a working session at the Israeli Foreign Ministry.</p>
<p>He was to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political adviser Dore Gold on Friday before leaving for Damascus where he will meet Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al- Shara and perhaps President Hafez al-Assad.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to open my post by bringing down the tensions and the temperature in the Middle East,&quot; Moratinos told Haaretz.</p>
<p>Israel and Syria have not held peace talks since Moslem militant suicide bombings in Israel killed 59 people in February and March. Netanyahu, elected in May, has enraged Syria by rejecting the previous government's willingness to trade occupied Arab land for peace.</p>
<p>Netanyahu this week in Spain was vague on the possibility of territorial compromise with Syria over the Golan Heights which Israel captured from Damascus in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>&quot;I have not ruled out a territorial discussion,&quot; Netanyahu told reporters in Madrid.</p>
<p>The EU appointed Moratinos on October 28 to help &quot;rescue the faltering peace process&quot;. Israel and the United States, main sponsor of the Middle East peace process initiated in Madrid in 1991, had been cool to a European role.</p>
<p>But his appointment was welcomed by Israel as well as the Palestinians who have been urging a more active European role since the right-wing Netanyahu took office.</p>
