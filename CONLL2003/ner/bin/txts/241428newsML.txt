NICOSIA 1996-12-06

A convertible 10 million pound bond local issue of the Bank of Cyprus was oversubscribed 2.6 times, the bank said in a statement.

The seven-year bonds, with a coupon of 6.75 percent will be distributed to entitled holders in respect of their pro-rata entitlement and then applications from the public at large will be examined, the statement said.

The issue was oversubscribed with bids totalling 26 million pounds.

The issue of convertible bonds in Cyprus and abroad is part of a drive by the bank to increase its capital base and continue expansions abroad.

In October, an international bond issue for 40 million pounds was oversubscribed 3.6 times. The issue, registered on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, pays an annual coupon of 6.75 percent.

The Bank of Cyprus plans a 25 million pound rights issue on the Cyprus Stock Exchange in May 1997.
