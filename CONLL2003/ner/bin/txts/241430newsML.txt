FEATURE-Israel said to bar native Palestinians from Jerusalem.

Racked with grief over his wife's death in London, Palestinian Hayyan Ju'beh packed his belongings and headed to his native Jerusalem to raise his two babies among family.

But soon after his arrival the 35-year-old journalist was shocked to find Israel had revoked his residency, effectively making him an illegal alien in his home town.

"The Israelis are stripping me of my right to live in Jerusalem simply because I moved to London for three years?" said Ju'beh, a correspondent for the London-based Middle East Broadcasting Centre (MBC).

"This was the most ridiculous thing I ever heard of," said Ju'beh, one of hundreds of Palestinians who have lost the right to live in Jerusalem.

While Israeli envoys encourage Jews worldwide to move to Israel, Palestinians say the Jewish state is leading a drive to deny native Jerusalem Arabs working or studying abroad the right to return home.

Israel denies carrying out a systematic policy against Palestinians, insisting it is only upholding the law.

The law does not single out Palestinians as an ethnic group. But rights activists say its enforcement targets the 160,000 Arabs who live in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed.

Civil rights centres say they are unable to cope with the flood of complaints. The top PLO official in Jerusalem, Faisal al-Husseini, estimates that more than 2,000 Palestinians have fallen victim to the policy.

ISRAELI RIGHTS GROUP HELPS

"We think it is a transfer of Palestinians from Jerusalem -- a quiet transfer. They are not taking people and putting them on trucks. They just take their residency so they don't have any status, rights or services," said Dalia Kerstein, director of the Israeli rights group Hamoked, one of several trying to help.

Many naturalised Americans of Palestinian origin were among those who lost their residency rights, prompting Washington to raise the issue with Israel.

Rights groups say Israel began implementing the policy in 1994 after it signed an interim peace deal with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) that also provided for a permanent settlement, including negotiations on the future of Jerusalem.

Israel has been using a 1952 law empowering the Interior Ministry to revoke the residency of "permanent residents" to reduce the number of Palestinians in the holy city ahead of the final status talks which have yet to resume, the groups say.

The PLO says the Israeli measure is illegal and a violation of the 1993 peace deal which states that each side must refrain from taking unilateral steps that prejudge the outcome of final status talks on the issue of Jerusalem and other issues.

"It is not only a violation of the PLO-Israel peace deal, it is also an attempt by Israel to evict Palestinians from Jerusalem, to reduce the number of Palestinians in the city and erase the Palestinian nature of Jerusalem," said Ziad Abu Ziad, a Palestinian official in charge of the Jerusalem issue.

Unlike Jewish immigrants who automatically become citizens with full rights for life, East Jerusalem Arabs ended up as "permanent residents" after Israel annexed their city against their will.

RIGHTS AT RISK

Clinging to the hope of returning to Arab sovereignty, Palestinians were unaware they risked losing their right to stay in Jerusalem under the status of "permanent residents".

"Even if you apply the law in a non-biased way, the result is the targeting of Palestinians because it is the Palestinians who have the status of permanent residents," said Jessica Montell of the Israeli Centre for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, also known as B'Tselem.

Palestinians say that for more than two decades Israel only revoked the residency of a few Arabs accused of anti-Israeli political activity -- by expelling them.

Human rights groups say the policy affects many categories, including Palestinians who have moved abroad for work or education and women married to Arabs residing in the West Bank or Gaza Strip and their children who reach the age of 16, when all Arabs must carry identity cards.

Rights activists say Israel has pursued the policy in a passive way, acting against Palestinians seeking services from Israeli Interior Ministry offices in East Jerusalem.

Seizing identity cards effectively renders them illegal aliens, virtually denying them access to all kinds of services and subjecting them to arrest each time they venture to leave Jerusalem, even for nearby towns.

"They don't go out to confiscate identity cards. They wait for people to come and seek services and once they come to the Interior Ministry they take away their identity cards," Hamoked's Kerstein said.

Like most Palestinians stranded without documents, Ju'beh lost his residency when he applied for a new travel document to take his children to visit their grandparents in London.

Thousands of Palestinians, squeezed out of Jerusalem into nearby towns by chronic housing shortages caused by Israeli zoning plans, face the possibility of losing residency rights.

Samira al-Da'our, 32, said the Israelis seized her identity card three months ago when she tried to renew the document on instructions from border officials while travelling to Jordan.

She said ministry officials told her that since she was married to a West Bank resident, she was no longer eligible to carry a Jerusalem identity card.

"I was born in Jerusalem and grew up there and I now cannot go to see my mother," Da'our said. "Immigrants from South Africa and Russia are allowed to live in Jerusalem and I am forbidden from doing so?"
