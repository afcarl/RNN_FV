<p>SUGAR: World market for December 5, 1996</p>
<p>White sugar futures in London finished firmer although light buying failed to pull prices above the psychological $300 per tonne level. March ended $0.50 stronger at $298.50, while May added $0.40 to close at $298.30 per tonne. There were no fresh fundamental news to influence prices. In New York raw sugar futures ended marginally higher in quiet trade. Speculative short covering gave the market an initial boost while locals were also light buyers. However, steady trade selling kept prices below resistance at 10.40 cents/lb for March delivery. March added 1 point to close at 10.31 cents/lb, while May closed 3 points higher at 10.45 cents/lb. The outer months added 2 to 5 points.</p>
<p>Physical brokers said that in the whites market there is no the danger that poorer quality sugar from Poland will be delivered against the No. 5 London white sugar contract which reduces the market's overall deliverable quality. Poland this season has an export surplus of more than 400,000 tonnes. Another worry for the whites market are the two new refineries in the Middle East churning out sugar and Indian exports which have covered demand in places where perhaps traditional EU-quality sugar would go. Traders said that although the spot value of the No. 5 contract currently stands at the lowest levels since February 1994, buyers have been reluctant to emerge and key players on the demand side such as Russia have still to make their requirements clear.</p>
