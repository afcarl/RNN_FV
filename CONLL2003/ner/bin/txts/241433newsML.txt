Italy police raid homes of ex-minister Di Pietro.

MILAN 1996-12-06

Tax police on Friday raided the homes and offices of former public works minister and ex-magistrate Antonio Di Pietro, a folk hero in Italy for his assault on public corruption, media reported.

RAI radio and news agencies said some 300 police were involved in the raids, ordered by magistrates in Brescia, northern Italy.

Di Pietro, 46, resigned from government on November 14 after coming under investigation by the Brescia pool over alleged irregularities in the way he conducted his inquiries when he himself was a magistrate.

The radio and Italian news agencies said the raids, totalling about 50 and of which around 10 were carried out in Rome, also involved homes and offices of business acquaintances of Di Pietro.

Di Pietro was the star investigator of the elite "Clean Hands" anti-graft team in Milan, which from 1992 launched a series of probes which led to the downfall of the country's political establishment and involved hundreds of businessmen.

The probes uncovered widespread payments of bribes by businesses to political parties in exchange for government contracts. Di Pietro was seen as the symbol of this anti-graft assault and public opinion polls still show him to be one of the most popular men in Italy.

Di Pietro, who belongs to no political party, quit the Milan magistrature in December 1994, shortly after the pool placed then-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi under investigation, amid rumours he had been forced out.

He was the target of an earlier probe by Brescia magistrates into allegations of corruption and of profiting from holding a public office. All charges against him were dropped in April shortly before being named to the cabinet.

Di Pietro was the first minister to resign from the seven-month-old centre-left cabinet of Prime Minister Romano Prodi.
