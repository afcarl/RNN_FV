Munich Re disaster claims low in 1996.

MUNICH, Germany 1996-12-06

Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance group, said on Friday that it had been relatively unaffected by natural catastrophes in the year to date.

Claims from natural catastrophes in the first 11 months, which count toward 1996/1997 accounts, were "once again relatively low," management board chairman Hans-Juergen Schinzler said in a speech prepared for the company's shareholders' meeting.

On the other hand, large damage claims were slightly higher than the year ago period, he said.

Munich Re, whose full name is Muenchener Rueckversicherungs AG, reported an underwriting profit of 573 million marks in 1995/1996, up from a 100-million-mark loss the previous year.

Schinzler also said Munich Re's parent company premium income was likely to rise only marginally in the year ending June 30 1997 from the 18 billion marks reported for 1995/1996.

However the outlook could be brightened by improved currency exchange rates this year, he said.
