Some oil leaves French Elf plants but output shut.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Workers at two out of three strike-hit Elf Aquitaine oil refineries in France have allowed some products out of the plants in the past 24 hours, union and management sources said on Friday.

But production at all three refineries remains shut while workers prepare to vote on an Elf pay and early retirement offer which unions say fails to address jobs.

Some products have left storage tanks at the Donges refinery in western France and the Grandpuits refinery near Paris since Thursday afternoon, the sources said. They could not estimate how much. Workers at Feyzin refused to open the valves, however.  

Unions had agreed to let some oil out of refinery storage tanks while negotiations over the nine-day-old strike lasted.

But strikers at the Feyzin plant near Lyon refused to join in because of what they regarded as a lack of cooperation by local management during the strike, a union source said.

The strike has crippled Elf's domestic network of three refineries with combined capacity of 440,000 barrels per day (bpd), a quarter of France's total, since last week.

Unions said strikers would vote from 1300 GMT on proposals including a 1.5 percent pay increase. One union, the CFDT, recommended the strike went on because Elf plans to cut jobs.
