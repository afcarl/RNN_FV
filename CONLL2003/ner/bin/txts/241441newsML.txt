STOCKHOLM 1996-12-06

Swedish construction company Skanska AB on Friday said it had won a joint order with fellow Swedish building group JM Byggnads & Fastighets AB worth 500 million crowns.  

The order from the Royal Institute of Technology and University of Stockholm is to build a new research and education centre in Stockholm.

Skanska said in a statement it will account for 65 percent of the contract and will also arrange the financing of the project.

The centre will be built close to the Roslagstull Hospital and is a combined relocation of large portions of the physics educational and research departments of both educational institutes.

Construction work will start immediately and be completed by the autumn of 1999.
