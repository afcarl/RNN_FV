Dutch central bank allocates fresh liquidity.

AMSTERDAM 1996-12-06

The Dutch central bank said on Friday it allocated 7.455 billion guilders to the money market under a seven-day special advances pact at an unchanged rate of 2.5 percent.

Individual bank applications up to 6.00 billion guilders were met for 22.0 percent. Above that level no subscriptions were awarded.

The pact replaces an eight-day facility of 6.47 billion guilders which expired today.
