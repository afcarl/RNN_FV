Credit Foncier next bug for French policy.

Lurking behind botched plans to sell off state electronics group Thomson and CIC bank is another tale of financial intrigue and mismanagement which could well be the next one to explode in the French government's face.

Credit Foncier de France, once a venerable property lender, is about to "nationalised" under government orders and gradually shut down after announcing a stunning loss of almost 11 billion francs ($2 billion) for 1995.

An announcement is expected on Monday on a takeover which the government has asked state-bank Caisse de Depots to carry out on its behalf at a cost of up to 2.7 billion francs as the prelude to gradually closing Credit Foncier down.

But the "managed wind-down" ordered by Finance Minister Jean Arthuis has run into formidable resistance from employees, trade unions as well as some shareholders and politicians.

They have long argued the losses were overbaked in order to trigger the fall of Credit Foncier and that the state is eager to wash its hands of a problem for which it is partly to blame.

Now, their claims that Credit Foncier is a viable business have suddenly gained added momentum, with the announcement this week by chairman Jerome Meyssonier to staff that the group is headed for a profit this year of one billion francs.

As in the case of the privatisation of Thomson and CIC bank before the two sales were suspended, the strategy chosen by the government looks increasingly fragile with each new development, and the clamours for an alternative are growing louder.

Arthuis' insistence that the group is beyond hope no longer carries quite the same weight, his opponents argue.

"Have you ever seen a bankrupt company make such a profit," argues Jean-Jacques Guillet, a politician from Prime Minister Alain Juppe's own RPR party who, along with a group of other politicians, has taken up the cause of the employees and wants a commission of enquiry to get to the root of the affair.

"I wonder if the accounts were not over-provisioned, pushing the group artificially over the brink," Guillet told Reuters.

Arthuis wants the business of managing Credit Foncier's existing, low-cost housing loan portfolio spun off to another group to clear the way for a gradual wind-down.

But Guillet, like the trade unions and staff, contends that he has rung the death knell too fast, that the process should be halted after the takeover and attempts renewed to find a partner for Credit Foncier.

One thing Arthuis and his adversaries do agree on is that Credit Foncier has suffered from what the minister himself dubbed the "reckless errors" of management in the past.

Like most groups involved in property when the bottom fell out of the market at the end of the 1980s Credit Foncier is suffering. And it was not helped by the abolition last year of its monopoly over the distribution of low cost home loans.

But it was this very monopoly and other special mandates which created ties between the private, stock-market listed group and the state, to the point where top management was and still is appointed by the government and overseen by Treasury officials.

Those officials are thus in the firing line for failing to spot the "reckless errors" of the past.

Just how bad those errors were will take time to reveal but Arthuis has already said the public prosecutor is looking into the case "so that any illegal actions can be sanctioned by the law".

For Guillet, there appears to be a "ghost in the closet" and Credit Foncier should not be the scapegoat in a settling of accounts by state administrators.
