Swiss money rates start firm, but seen easing.

ZURICH 1996-12-06

Swiss short-term money market rates were firm in early trading, but were expected to ease in the afternoon, continuing this week's pattern, dealers said.

Tomorow/next money was trading just below 2.00 percent in early trade, but was likely to ease toward 1.50 percent in the afternoon, dealers said.

The recent tightening is largely seen as technical and not connected to any change in policy by the Swiss National Bank, which dealers said conducted normal operations this morning.

The traditional tightening of rates at year-end is also a factor, dealers added. -- Zurich Editorial +41 1 631 7340
