Austria VAE sees '96 pre-tax up, net down.

VIENNA 1996-12-06

Austrian points producer VAE AG said on Friday net profit this year would fall short of 1995's 120 million schillings by around 10 million due to a bigger tax burden but forecast over 10 percent growth in pre-tax earnings.

"We managed to exceed our plan in terms of turnover and pre-tax profit and compensate a large part of the tax effect," chief executive Mohamed Kaddoura told Reuters.

Last year VAE posted a pre-tax profit of 128.1 million schillings on turnover of 1.66 billion schillings.

Kaddoura said the firm's tax liability would rise in 1996 because of the scrapping in 1996 and 1997 of tax breaks on previously incurred losses. He estimated VAE would pay around 25 percent tax this year.

VAE's order backlog was 1.1 billion schillings at the end of November, 10 percent above the previous year, Kaddoura said.

He saw all VAE units ending the year in the black, with the strongest growth at its subsidiaries in the United States and Canada. They had added between 15 and 20 percent to turnover and pre-tax earnings.

"Our declared strategy of penetrating new markets and creating joint ventures has paid off," he said, adding that further joint ventures were planned for 1997.

Kaddoura said VAE was confident its shares would become continuously traded in 1997 and join the Vienna bourse's EQOS electronic trading system.
