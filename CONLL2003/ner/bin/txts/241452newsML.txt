Colonia sees 96 profit up at least five pct.

COLOGNE, Germany 1996-12-06

German insurance group Colonia Konzern AG said on Friday it expected its 1996 net profits to rise at least five percent, with 1996 premium income up 5.5 percent to 10.7 billion marks.

Colonia added that it expected 1997 group premium income to rise around four percent and 1997 earnings to build on the progress expected in 1996.  

Colonia has said before that it expects 1996 profits to be higher than the 210 million marks it made in 1995, but has not quantified how much growth it expected.

The Colonia board said it was confident that the 1997 results from its individual group businesses would build on the "very good" results expected this year.

It said however it was only expecting moderate premium income growth of around four percent next year.

An improvement in German economic conditions next year would bring "hardly any positive impetus" to the German insurance market, it added.
