Spring says EU trade deal for Belgrade unlikely.

BRUSSELS 1996-12-06

European Union foreign ministers were set on Friday to snub Yugoslavia by refusing to grant it the preferential trade status it has offered to others in the region.

Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, arriving in Brussels to chair a meeting of foreign ministers, all-but dimissed any chance of offering Belgrade a deal.

"I would think it is unlikely that we will be in a position to grant it," Spring told reporters.

He stressed it was important that democracy was respected in Serbia and Montenegro, what is left of the old Yugoslavia, and that EU's job was to do whatever it could to help that happen.

At their last meeting on November 25, EU foreign ministers agreed in principle to grant Serbia and Montenegro preferential trade treatment with the 15-country bloc -- but to delay implementation at least until their December 6 meeting.

EU sources have said that the situation since then has not improved, rather the opposite.

The annulment of municipal election results, what the EU perceives as Belgrade's lack of assistance in pursuing alleged war criminals and continued tension over the Serb-governed Kosovo region are among reasons why the ministers are reluctant to reward Belgrade with preferential trade terms.
