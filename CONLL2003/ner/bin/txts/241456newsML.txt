PARIS 1996-12-06

An overwhelming majority of Credit Foncier de France shares have been tendered to an offer launched by state-owned bank CDC for the specialist property lender, the business daily Les Echos reported on Friday.

The newspaper said the 70 franc per share offer had met "clear success" and that some 80 to 90 percent of shares were tendered to CDC's bid for the bank, due to be wound down by the government because of heavy property losses .

The results of the offer are to be officially published on December 9.
