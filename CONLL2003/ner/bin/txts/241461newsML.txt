Bomb hits Corsican port blocked by fishermen.

AJACCIO, Corsica 1996-12-06

A bomb exploded overnight in Porto-Vecchio, one of several ports on the troubled French Mediterranean island of Corsica blocked by a fishermen's protest, police said on Friday.

No one was hurt and no one claimed responsibility for the bomb. Corsica has been racked for two decades by bombings by militants pushing for greater autonomy from mainland France.

The blast late on Thursday destroyed a building in the south-eastern port that included ticket offices of SNCM, the main shipping company serving the French island.

Fishermen are blocking the Corsican ports of Ajaccio, Bastia, Porto-Vecchio and Ile Rousse to push for concessions in a government plan to grant tax breaks to the island as part of a plan to defuse separatist violence.

Fishermen want cuts in payroll charges and want fuel prices on the island pegged to those in a mainland French port.

A court on Wednesday told fishermen to lift a blockade that has kept an SNCM car ferry in Ajaccio since Tuesday, ordering them to pay 100,000 francs ($20,000) for every day the blockade lasts as well as a fine of 10,000 francs.

A group close to the Cuncolta naziunalista separatist group occupied offices from Thursday night of the SNCM in Ajaccio and Bastia.
