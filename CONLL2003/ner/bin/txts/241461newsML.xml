<title>FRANCE: Bomb hits Corsican port blocked by fishermen.</title>
<headline>Bomb hits Corsican port blocked by fishermen.</headline>
<dateline>AJACCIO, Corsica 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>A bomb exploded overnight in Porto-Vecchio, one of several ports on the troubled French Mediterranean island of Corsica blocked by a fishermen's protest, police said on Friday.</p>
<p>No one was hurt and no one claimed responsibility for the bomb. Corsica has been racked for two decades by bombings by militants pushing for greater autonomy from mainland France.</p>
<p>The blast late on Thursday destroyed a building in the south-eastern port that included ticket offices of SNCM, the main shipping company serving the French island.</p>
<p>Fishermen are blocking the Corsican ports of Ajaccio, Bastia, Porto-Vecchio and Ile Rousse to push for concessions in a government plan to grant tax breaks to the island as part of a plan to defuse separatist violence.</p>
<p>Fishermen want cuts in payroll charges and want fuel prices on the island pegged to those in a mainland French port.</p>
<p>A court on Wednesday told fishermen to lift a blockade that has kept an SNCM car ferry in Ajaccio since Tuesday, ordering them to pay 100,000 francs ($20,000) for every day the blockade lasts as well as a fine of 10,000 francs.</p>
<p>A group close to the Cuncolta naziunalista separatist group occupied offices from Thursday night of the SNCM in Ajaccio and Bastia.</p>
