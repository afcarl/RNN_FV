Unidanmark appointed Norges Bank dealer.

COPENHAGEN 1996-12-06

Denmark's second biggest bank Unidanmark said on Friday it had been appointed a primary dealer by Norges Bank, the Norwegian central bank.

It said it was the first foreign bank to receive the appointment.

In Norway, 10 specially selected banks and broker firms operate as primary dealers, their role being to ensure an effective and liquid market for Norwegian state bonds and monitor developments on the bond market generally, Unidanmark said in a statement.

In 1993, Unidanmark was appointed primary dealer in Finland, achieving the same status in Sweden later.
