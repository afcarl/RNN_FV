Elekta buys Johnson & Johnson unit.

STOCKHOLM 1996-12-06

Swedish medical technology group Elekta on Friday said it had signed an agreement with Johnson & Johnson to buy its Cordis Neuroscience division with a turnover of about 120 million crowns a year.

The deal still needed approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which can take up to three months, Elekta said in a statement.

The purchase is not expected to mean any dilution of Elektra's profit per share and involves no goodwill.

The acquisition will be financed with the company's own means and bank finance.

Cordis Neuroscience specialises in producing and selling implants and one-off items for treatment of water on the brain, a market that is estimated to be worth a total of 400 million crowns a year.
