Stora CEO denies Brazil mill plans.

STOCKHOLM 1996-12-06

Swedish forestry group Stora AB has no plans to set up a pulp mill in Brazil, the company's chief executive officer (CEO) Lars-Ake Helgesson said on Friday.

"We have no plans to build a mill there -- it is complete nonsense," Helgesson told Reuters on Friday, quashing a report in Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet.

"We have people in Brazil, but that is in line with our general market research."  

The Friday newspaper article said Stora plans to build a mega mill in Brazil, a project costing billions of crowns.

According to the article, seven players aiming to build a mill contacted Stora for cooperation.

Helgesson said the article was completely unfounded.
