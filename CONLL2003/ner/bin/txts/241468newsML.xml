<title>FRANCE: Italy's Alenia boosts Airbus role.</title>
<headline>Italy's Alenia boosts Airbus role.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>France's Aerospatiale said on Friday that Italy's Alenia would draw closer to the four-nation Airbus Industrie plane making consortium.</p>
<p>But a spokeswoman for Airbus said that Alenia would not become a partner in the consortium, next to Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace and CASA of Spain.  </p>
<p>&quot;Today, the five major European Aerospace companies...have reached agreement on further rationalisation of the industry,&quot; Aerospatiale said in a statement which was also published by the other companies.</p>
<p>It said that Alenia, which is already a subcontractor to Airbus and involved in the Airbus military transport programme for the Future Large Aircraft (FLA) would now also become involved in the AXX, the high capacity four-engined aircraft project.</p>
<p>Sweden's Saab has also expressed an interest in joining the AXX project as have Dutch politicians in order to salvage jobs and knowledge at bankrupt Fokker.</p>
<p>The statement said that Alenia will also be requested to participate in programmes of new derivatives from existing Airbus products, such as the A340-600.</p>
<p>A specific agreement has been reached on the new 100-seat jet family in which all the European partners involved have agreed that it will be part of the Airbus product range.</p>
<p>Airbus Industrie, together with Alenia/Finmeccanica, will establish a new company to lead the European participation in the joint venture with China and Singapore.</p>
<p>Previously, both a team of DASA and Fokker as well as the AIA grouping of British Aerospace, Aerospatiale and Alenia had been competing to win the favours of China for the joint development of a 100-seat family for the booming Asian market.</p>
<p>DASA/Fokker dropped out and AIA won the deal in competition with Boeing. The Chinese government has let it be known that it would appreciate that Airbus could be involved as well.</p>
<p>The agreement announced on Friday puts the joint ventures with China and Singapore back on the Airbus level and ends a dispute among the consortium members.</p>
<p>&quot;Aerospatiale, Alenia, British Aerospace, CASA and DASA plan this new Airbus Industry company will lead the European contributions to the programme management, product and technical development, sales and product support of the project,&quot; the statement said.</p>
