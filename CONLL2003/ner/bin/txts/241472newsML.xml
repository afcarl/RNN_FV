<p>Following are some of the leading stories in the Swedish papers this morning. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>DAGENS NYHETER</p>
<p>- The euro, the planned European single currency, will cost Sweden billions of crowns as all public sector computer systems will have to be changed, according to state authorities. Sweden also has to adjust its three largest airports to EU standard, which will cost at least half a billion crowns, according to preliminary estimates by the air traffic authorities. It is not yet settled who will pay for the airport changes but the state is not willing to spend any money on it, according to information given to the paper.</p>
<p>- Swedish residents of Chinese descent have lost millions of crowns through investments in illegal foreign exchange transactions via Currency Exchange Stockholm, known as Fairbank. The illegal trade has been handled by a British businessman from Hong Kong with offices in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo. To deal with foreign exchange, firms need a permit from the central bank, which Fairbank does not have.</p>
<p>- In 1998, Sweden is expected to host the most advanced military partnership (PFF) exercise to date, led by Nato, and encompassing the U.S., Russia and the Baltics. The Swedish defense is already planning the exercise, but the government, which has said it wants a closer PFF cooperation, has not yet approved the exercise.</p>
<p>SVENSKA DAGBLADET</p>
<p>- Since Sweden joined E.U., illegal alcohol handling has increased and costs the state two billion crowns annually in lost tax income, according to the president of supervising authority Vin &amp; Sprit, Egon Jacobsson. Jacobsson is very concerned that more than half of alcohol currently sold in Sweden is illegal and says that politicians have lost their grip on the market for liquer and beer.</p>
<p>- Forestry group Stora plans to set up a mega-mill in Brazil, a project costing billions of crowns. The mill could become one of the world's largest mills for making short fibre eucalyptus pulp. Stora has been contacted by seven players aiming to build a new pulp mill in Brazil. Stora confirms it has people in Brazil at the moment, but says it is also looking at South East Asia as an alternative.</p>
<p>- Yet another executive is leaving Swedish/U.S. drugs company Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn as Goran Pettersson, responsible for eye operations, will become president and chief executive officer of Swedish company Meda. Pettersson is the fourth therapy area head to leave the company this year. Pettersson denies that his resignation depends on work conditions at Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn and says he received an offer he could not refuse.</p>
<p>DAGENS INDUSTRI</p>
<p>- The Swedish Maritime Authoritiy said fewer ferries operating in Nordic waters, fewer scheduled trips and increased prices for both freight and passengers will be some of the conequences for Swedish ferry companies when all taxfree sales are phased out from July 1, 1999, as required by the European Union. Taxfree sales on Swedish ferries totalled 8.9 billion crowns in 1995, including revenues from bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>- The Stockholm Stock Exchange wants to quickly start negotiations with its counterparts in Helsinki, Oslo and Copenhagen regarding a joint stock trading system. The aim is to start to develop a regional exchange during the first half of 1997. It is expected to take two years to create a functioning forum for trading in stock from all four Nordic countries.</p>
<p>- Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, lowered two key interest rates by 50 basis points on Thursday, as widely expected, in a sign its most important money-market rate has further room to fall.</p>
<p>- Although British car sales declined five percent last month, the number of Saab cars registered in Britain climbed in November by 41 percent. Volvo sales rose 36 percent.</p>
