Elf refinery strikers to vote on offer.

PARIS 1996-12-06

Striking Elf Aquitaine workers will vote from 1300 GMT on Friday on whether to end a stoppage at the oil giant's French refineries after Elf made offers on pay and conditions on Thursday, union officials said.

Union officials have bitterly rejected Elf's offer as irrelevant to the strike which was sparked by plans to cut 10 percent of Elf's French refining staff.

But while some strikers vowed to keep up the action, others were said to be growing weary on day nine of the strike.

"They are very disappointed but they are getting fed up," said one union official at the Grandpuits plant near Paris.  

But a union official at the larger Feyzin refinery near Lyon said the mood among the strikers there was still determined.

"The way things are going does not satisfy us at all," the official from the CFDT union said. "We don't give a damn about salaries. That was not why we have had nine days of strike," she said.

Unions said that strikers said strikers would vote between 1300 GMT and 1500 GMT at Feyzin and at 1300 GMT at the Grandpuits and Donges refineries.  

The union official at Feyzin said that salaries were to have been negotiated on December 20 and were not the issue in the current strike.

"The people here are very motivated to protect jobs. They have friends who are on the dole," she said.

Union officials said on Thursday that Elf had offered to raise pay by 1.5 percent from July next year but had refused to withdraw a plan to cut 330 jobs.

Elf has not said what offer it made.
