<p>The following are the main stories from Friday morning's Austrian newspapers:</p>
<p>DER STANDARD</p>
<p>- The government plans to hand over its 17 percent stake in Bank Austria to the post and telecomms company PTBG, which should then sell it to a foreign investment bank next year.</p>
<p>- Due to changes in accounting methods Austria's gross domestic product has fallen by 80 billion schillings to 2,272.3 billion schillings for the last year.</p>
<p>- From 1997 on the Finance Minister will control the budgets of Austria's ministries.</p>
<p>- Car maker Steyr-Daimler-Puch and U.S. Chrysler have signed a contract which will secure production at Steyr's southern Austrian plant for six more years until 2004. The deal is worth ten billion schillings for Steyr-Daimler-Puch and some 400 new jobs will be created.</p>
<p>- Insurers Wiener Staedtische and Grazer Wechselseitige plan to take legal action against the merger of building material makers Kies Union and Lieferbeton, as they say their shares in Kies Union were devalued in the process.</p>
<p>- Brewer Brau-Union has bought a 1.5 percent stake in Rumanian brewer Arbema, giving it 50.2 percent in total.</p>
<p>- After a near insolvency a few years ago, motorbike maker KTM will be listed on Vienna's stock exchange on December 12. Due to high demand for shares they may be sold in a lottery system.</p>
<p>DIE PRESSE</p>
<p>- Karl Stix, deputy head of Austria's Social Democrat Party has warned that a fast eastward expansion of the European Union would only benefit EU-opponents and therefore endanger the Union.</p>
<p>- Fire engine maker Rosenbauer said orders were at a record high at over one billion schillings this year, compared with 633 million schillings last year.</p>
<p>KURIER</p>
<p>- Discussions between trade unions and the government on reforming Austria's civil service have resulted in a compromise. Unions are satisfied, as most privileges have been retained.</p>
<p>- Senior members of conservative junior coalition partners OeVP have criticised the Social Democrats' security policies. Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel favours gradual integration into NATO and the EU's defence arm Western European Union.</p>
