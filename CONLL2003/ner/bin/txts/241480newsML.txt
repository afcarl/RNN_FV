Veba sees higher internal financing.

ESSEN, Germany 1996-12-06

German diversified industrial group Veba AG will see internal financing clearly climb in the years ahead despite higher investment, chief financial officer Hans Michael Gaul said late on Thursday.

Gaul said higher internal financing would help improve the company's financial flexibility, allowing it to take advantage of strategic options.

Group chairman Ulrich Hartmann said at the same event that Veba's return on equity capital would improve in 1996.

"We will make another step this year toward our goal of 15 percent return on equity capital after taxes," he said.

Last year, the return equity return was 11.4 percent.
