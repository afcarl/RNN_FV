Italian police raid ex-minister Di Pietro's homes.

MILAN 1996-12-06

Italian tax police launched raids on the homes and offices of former public works minister and ex-magistrate Antonio Di Pietro on Friday morning, RAI radio said.

The radio said some 300 police were involved in the raids, ordered by magistrates in Brescia, northern Italy.  

The radio and Italian news agencies said about 50 raids were carried out, of which around 10 were in Rome. They also involved homes and offices of business acquaintances of Di Pietro.

Di Pietro, the symbol of Italy's "Clean Hands" anti-graft team, resigned as a minister in Prime Minister Romano Prodi's centre-left government last month.

He stormed out of the government after coming under investigation for alleged malpractice while working with the team of Milan magistrates in the early 1990s, when its investigations into corruption toppled Italy's governing class.

Di Pietro, who belongs to no political party, quit the Milan magistrature in December 1994 amid rumours he had been forced out. He emerged with his reputation intact earlier this year from allegations of abuse of office that were thrown out of court.
