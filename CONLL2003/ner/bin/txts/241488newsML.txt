ESSEN, Germany 1996-12-06

Germany's diversified industrial group Veba AG said it has increased its annual five year investment budget by 13 percent to 32.3 billion marks.

The group prepares a five year investment budget every year and these figures refer to the 1997-2001 budget, the group said.

"The increase will largely be earmarked for the chemicals sector and to some extent for the electricity sector," Veba chief financial officer Hans Michael Gaul said.

In the medium-term the group plans to invest 12.4 billion marks abroad, which is almost twice as much as was planned last year.
