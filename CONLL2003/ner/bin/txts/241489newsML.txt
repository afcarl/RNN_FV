Veba sees 15 pct rise in 96 pre-tax net.

ESSEN, Germany 1996-12-06

Diversified industrial group Veba AG said it expected full-year 1996 pre-tax profit to rise 15 percent while net profit is expected to climb by 25 percent.

"We expect we can repeat the nine-month results for the whole year," Veba chief executive Ulrich Hartmann said.

Hartmann added the group's tax rate would be slightly lower this year than in 1995 due to a shift of profits abroad.

Last year Veba posted a net profit of 1.9 billion marks.

In the first nine months of 1996 the group posted a 25.2 percent rise in group pre-tax profits to 1.227 billion marks. Group net profit, including minorities, rose 22 percent to 1.407 billion marks.
