<headline>FEATURE - Opera-loving WTO boss driven by free trade.</headline>

<p>One hot morning last summer, a tiny electric blue Italian saloon chugged past pickets of striking staff into the grounds of the World Trade Organisation and pulled up in the executive parking lot.</p>
<p>Extracting his tall, heavy frame with some difficulty from behind the wheel, out climbed a grinning the WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero, who is accustomed to a more comfortable mode of transport.</p>
<p>&quot;I told my driver he was free today,&quot; he told reporters as the strikers cheered and he waved back. &quot;I wanted to show solidarity with my people.&quot;</p>
<p>The strike, essentially over pay and conditions, illustrated the problem that faces the 66-year-old former Italian and European Community diplomat as he tries to steer the fledgling body towards his own dream of a world without trade barriers.</p>
<p>For as the appointee of the currently 125 member countries of the body, he has to bend to their collective will -- and their WTO ambassadors had little sympathy for the stoppage.</p>
<p>STEERING THE AGENDA</p>
<p>In the day-to-day business of the organisation and its Secretariat -- administering the trade rules agreed among the member-states and steering the agenda towards new accords -- his wishes and those of the &quot;delegations&quot; do not always coincide.</p>
<p>Next Monday Ruggiero will report in Singapore to the first Ministerial Conference of the WTO, launched in 1995 to replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>
<p>He had hoped to be going to the week-long gathering carrying a declaration for the ministers to sign firmly committing themselves to developing the multilateral trading system over which the WTO presides.</p>
<p>Instead, despite driving weary envoys through days and nights of negotiation last week to agree a text, he has to pass the final choices onto the member governments' representatives.</p>
<p>&quot;He was bitterly disappointed,&quot; said a close aide. &quot;But he at least had the satisfaction of knowing he had done his best.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some of us were begging him to give up,&quot; said one envoy who sat through the late-night sessions. &quot;You would have thought that someone of his age and bulk would have been happy to go and get some sleep. But he just kept us at it.&quot;</p>
<p>VETERAN OF TALKS WITH RUSSIANS</p>
<p>Ruggiero, a veteran of negotiations with unmoveable Soviet officials during an early posting to the Italian embassy in Moscow in the late 1950s, is sanguine about the outcome.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a good negotiation on the declaration,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview before heading for Singapore.</p>
<p>&quot;Every good trade negotiation must have a moment of suspense and some moment in which everyone believes there is a dramatic confrontation.&quot;</p>
<p>But he is convinced that whatever the disagreements -- some between developed and developing countries and some that cut across the traditional North-South divide -- the Singapore meeting will be another step along the global free trade road.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to make clear that we have the ambition....to arrive at one universal free trade area with rules and disciplines internationally agreed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;And if we get there, I think we will have made a huge contribution to peace and security in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>FORMER EU DIPLOMAT</p>
<p>Ruggiero came to the WTO in May 1995 as its first full-term Director-General, appointed after a bruising big-power battle in which he was the European Union candidate against the U.S. preference, ex-Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari.</p>
<p>A former executive of the Italian motor firm FIAT, he had been for nearly two decades a senior European Commission official in Brussels. But he feels he is firmly his own man.</p>
<p>&quot;Above all I have to be fair and represent everybody,&quot; he says. &quot;I think I can say I have been able to do that.&quot; One of his major concerns in Singapore is to get big power agreement to open markets to the products from the world's poorest states.</p>
<p>A close aide says he has two regrets over private passions he has had to give up over the past 18 months -- and probably for the remaining two-and-a-half years of his term.</p>
<p>&quot;He loves opera and classical music, but he has no time to enjoy it. He adores pasta, but given his size and the pressures here he has had to renounce that too,&quot; the aide said.</p>
