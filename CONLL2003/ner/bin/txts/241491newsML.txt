FEATURE - North-South face-off set for trade talks.

GENEVA 1996-12-06

Ministers from some 150 countries gather in Singapore next weekend for talks that could determine whether the world pushes on towards global free trade or slides into a new era of protectionism and competing power blocs.

And signs are already flashing that the week-long meeting, the first Ministerial Conference of the two-year-old World Trade Organisation, will be far from the trouble-free encounter for which its organisers had prayed.

After weeks of discussion and days and nights of often fierce argument over the text of a final declaration for Singapore, ambassadors to the Geneva-based WTO threw in their hand last Friday and passed the problem onto the ministers.

Their failure means the gathering will almost certainly witness a degree of North-South confrontation that bodes ill for hopes of a fresh impulse to more freedom in world trade.

DIVISIVE ISSUES

At the heart of the debate are issues that have long divided major developed and developing countries -- trade and labour standards, textiles, the awarding of government contracts, or procurement, and the corruption this often involves.

Others -- like national investment and competition policies designed to favour local firms, and when to get started on new global talks aimed at wider openings to agricultural trade -- cut across traditional North-South fault lines.

But there is a more general disagreement -- on whether, as developing countries want, the ministers should focus on ensuring what was agreed in the 1994 Marrakesh world trade accord is being implemented rather than adding "new issues" to the WTO's agenda as big powers would like.

Also hanging in the air is the the proliferation of regional trade groupings, which could threaten the cohesion of the WTO and the global rules it was set up to administer, and of when the big absentees -- China and Russia -- might come in.

Both, along with nearly 30 other countries in the WTO waiting room, will be in Singapore along with the 125 current members of the body -- created in the 1986-93 Uruguay Round negotiations to replace the old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

BRINGING DOWN BARRIERS

WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero argues that the declaration should be a ringing affirmation of the ministers' determination to keep working through the organisation to bring down barriers to trade into the 21st century.

He fought hard to get a text completed for the Singapore meeting -- from December 9-13 -- that would have more or less satisfied everyone and kept a common thread of accord.

Ruggiero, and many analysts with him, fears that unless the free trade momentum is kept up, anger among workers and farmers in North and South at the perceived effects on their jobs of the growing global market will overwhelm the politicians.

The dilemma is that while North and South agree on where they ought to be heading, they differ sharply on how to get there and how fast they should be travelling.

The governments of industrialised and developing states recognise they need to trade increasingly with each other -- in both goods and the booming services that make up one third of world commerce -- to ensure their peoples' economic progress.

BIG POWER POLITICS

But big power policy-makers -- especially in the United States and the European Union -- are under heavy pressure from economic and political protectionists who think tariff walls and last-ditch defence of "national sovereignty" can stave off the negative effects of globalisation.

Increasingly, governments in the North feel the need to prove to sceptical labour and environmental lobbies that the WTO is not just working to the benefit of big multinational companies active across the global economy.

So many richer countries, led by the United States, argue the WTO must address in some way the question of how far lower wages and scant social protection in developing countries produces an unfair trade advantage in the form of cheaper goods.

A U.S. push for the conclusion of a global deal in Singapore abolishing tariffs by the year 2000 on information technology products is partly driven by concern to show that freer trade can have a job pay-off in domestic "hi-tech" industries.

Governments of developing countries face their own domestic sceptics on free trade and the value of the WTO, as protests in Manila during last month's meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) showed.

And many of them -- especially the key Asian emerging economies -- feel the industrialised powers are not doing enough to meet their concerns, particularly in opening up for textiles and clothing, so refuse to budge on the "new issues."

Despite U.S. and EU protestations to the contrary, they see the labour issue as a device to provide the big powers, under cover of the WTO, with an excuse to shut off access for even more of their goods to the North American and European markets.

They also argue that efforts by the EU to start talks on competition policy and by Canada and Japan, backed by Brussels, to discuss investment policy in the WTO are largely aimed at a total takeover of their domestic economies.

There seems little room for compromise in Singapore, with key countries on both sides hinting that they would rather have no overall agreement -- and declaration -- at all rather than give in on their core demands.

But one key envoy in Geneva voiced cautious optimism. "We here could not make the political decisions that were needed. When faced with the alternative, the ministers will surely find a way to keep the trading system on the tracks," he said.
