U.N. Palestine refugee agency gets $133 million.

UNITED NATIONS 1996-12-05

Pledges totalling $133 million were announced on Thursday for the U.N. agency which provides educational, medical, food and other aid for 3.3 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

The United Nations said this was nearly three times the sum announced during a similar pledging meeting last year but well below the $352 million needed by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) to maintain its present level of services in 1997.

The pledges were made by representatives of 27 countries. Among the largest were those of the United States ($70 million), Sweden ($20.1 million), Norway ($13.2 million), Germany ($9.1 million), Netherlands (7.5 million) and Switzerland ($6.9 million).

UNRWA's Commissioner General, Peter Hansen, said the agency, which began operations in 1950, had gone through one of its most difficult periods.

"We may well scrape through 1997, or we may face another structural deficit of up to $50 million," he said.

"Unless corrected by massive donor intervention, the agency will have to undertake a radical adjustment in its programmes in the coming period," Hansen said, adding that this could have political ramifications for the stability of the region.
