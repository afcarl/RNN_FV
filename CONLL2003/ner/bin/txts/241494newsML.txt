WARSAW 1996-12-06

Polish paint maker Polifarb Cieszyn SA sees its net profit rising to 19 million zlotys this year and to 22 million in 1997 from last year's 15.3 million, the company's marketing director said on Friday.

Jozef Sroczyk told Reuters the company expected the next several years would be profitable for paint makers thanks to expanding Polish car and construction industry.

"We expect this year's net profit at 19 million zlotys and at 22 million next year...we think next years will be profitable, we especially count on growing demand from car makers," he said.

He added Polifarb Cieszyn was supplying paints for Fiat factories in Poland and two other producers and was intending to broaden the cooperation.
