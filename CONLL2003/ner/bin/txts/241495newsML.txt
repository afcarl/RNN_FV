Franksfurt shares open lower on Greenspan remarks.

FRANKFURT 1996-12-06

German shares plummeted in floor trading, following Asian markets downward after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan voiced worries about recent steep gains in U.S. financial markets.

The bourse DAX index tumbled 74.69 points, or 2.6 percent, to 2,835.22 after opening at 0930 GMT. The setback wiped out gains in the last week that had propelled the blue-chip index to record highs, including the first-ever bourse closing over the 2,900 mark.

Greenspan, in a speech late on Thursday, said the central bank should be concerned warned about "irrational exuberance" infecting stock and bond markets. The remarks sparked a sell-off in dollars and a deep slide in the key Nikkei 225 index, which closed down more than three percent.

After spending most of the week near 23-month highs at the 1.56 level, the dollar traded at about 1.54 marks, pressuring many German shares.

"The biggest gainers of the past few days are now the biggest losers because of the dollar," one Frankfurt trader said.

Export-oriented chemical stocks, which had underpinned this week's rally, fell broadly early on Friday.

Bayer AG led the bourse DAX losses, falling five percent to 61.85 marks. Hoechst AG dropped to 67.27 and BASF AG to 59.20, both stocks reeling more than three percent.

Shares in utility group Veba AG were down 1.55 marks, or 1.95 percent, to 88.30. They fell less than the rest of the market because management said it expected 1996 pretax profit to rise 15 percent and net profit by 25 percent in 1996.

Muenchener Rueckversicherungs AG, the world's largest reinsurance company, traded at 3,715 marks by 1035 GMT, down 33 although it had fallen as many as 89 marks. The company said earnings for the year ending June 30, 1997, would "not quite reach" the level of 1995-96.
