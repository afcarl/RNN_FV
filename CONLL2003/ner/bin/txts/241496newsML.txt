French shares plunge on Greenspan dinner comments.

PARIS 1996-12-06

French shares fell by over two percent at the opening on Friday, with all 40 blue-chip shares in the red, on a warning by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, at a dinner on Thursday after Wall Street's close, against "irrational exuberance" in financial markets.

The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 54.66 points or 2.38 percent at 2,237.84 at 0919 GMT while the CAC-40 futures contract was down at 2,244 from 2,294 on Thursday's close.

Other European markets also fell and Tokyo slipped 3.19 percent. December French bond futures also dropped.

Dealers said they expected Wall Street could start with a 100 point fall. "We have less reason to fall than New York, we have reached the bottom," a dealer said.

Dealers noted that the U.S. weekly jobless claims, due at 1330 GMT, could spring another surprise on the market.

The Greenspan comments were the catalyst for massive profit taking with Wall Street at record highs and the CAC-40 index near its all time high of 2,360.98.

The index hit a low of 2,236.16 before bouncing back slightly in early trading. Volume was one billion francs.

During a dinner at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, Greenspan said that there was a risk that the financial bubble would burst.

"Greenspan sent a clear message to the markets -- Gentlemen, you are overdoing it, restrain yourselves. He is puncturing the speculative bubble that fuelled New York and other markets," a dealer said, adding there was no panic selling.

"The correction will be quite volatile for a number of days but then there will be a stabilisation on a healthy level and we can be serene at the start of 1997," another broker said    "As

always, there is a correction in the U.S. and Europe gets it the face," a broker said.

Havas, down 2.3 percent at 371 francs, on Thursday evening said that it and Belgium's GBL had approved the proposed merger between Luxembourg's CLT and the UFA television activities of Germany's Bertelsmann.
