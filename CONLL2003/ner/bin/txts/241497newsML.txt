VW -legal authorities must decide on Lopez.

WOLFSBURG, Germany 1996-12-06

German carmaker Volkswagen AG said on Friday that legal authorities must decide if its former purchasing manager Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua acted legally.

	  A Volkswagen spoksman, Klaus Kocks, told Reuters that VW

was waiting for a decision from the Darmstadt public prosecutor's office on whether charges will be filed against Lopez on allegations he stole secret documents from General Motors Corp in 1993 when he left the company to join VW.

Kocks also said that VW officials named as defendants in a U.S. civil court law suit filed by GM against VW would agree to testify in any future court hearings.

"There have been reports in Detroit newspapers that all Volkswagen officials would plead the Fifth Amendment and agree to take their right not to incriminate themselves," Kocks said. He added "I can not speak for Mr. Lopez but as far as Volkswagen is concerned all top executives will go to court, including in Detroit." Kocks said.
