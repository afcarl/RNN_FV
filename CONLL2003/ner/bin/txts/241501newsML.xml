<p>After years of wrangling and indecision, Japan on Friday unveiled a new corporate structure for telecoms titan NTT that will create a family of firms under a single holding company.</p>
<p>But analysts dismissed the plan for a new-look Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp as a half-hearted compromise that would do little to spur domestic competition and might not help NTT compete effectively with overseas rivals.</p>
<p>Under the plan, NTT will be allowed to realise its long-held dream of entering the international market, although this could still be a few years away.</p>
<p>The breakup of the world's largest phone company has been debated for more than a decade, with NTT managers fighting to keep the corporate colossus as a single entity.</p>
<p>Under the plan agreed between the government and NTT, the company will be reformed into two regional local operators and one long-distance group under a holding company. NTT says it will cost 450 billion yen ($4 billion) and take at least two years to carry out the restructuring.</p>
<p>&quot;Japan should no longer lag behind in the international telecommunications field,&quot; said Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.</p>
<p>But industry analysts were unimpressed by the plan, saying it would do little to bring competition to the lagging telecommunications market in Japan and would not help NTT battle increasingly formidable opponents abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;The new scheme means NTT remains one big company,&quot; said Yoshio Suzuki, a former member of a government deregulation committee.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't expect such things as harsh rate cuts, competition and reasonable services. It is welcome news for BT (British Telecommunications ) and the world's big carriers that Japan's market will remain inactive for years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>NTT said the reorganisation is expected to take at least two years, delaying its entry into the global market.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe we need two years after the government passes the necessary bills before we can split. We think it is difficult to do so in 1998 and we think it will take place in 1999,&quot; a senior NTT official told a news conference.</p>
<p>High rates and lack of innovation in Japan's telecommunications sector have become an increasing worry to policy-makers as innovations leap ahead elsewhere, leaving Japan behind in the crucial area.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a major victory (for NTT),&quot; said one telecommunications expert, who doubted whether the changes would tackle efficiency problems at NTT. &quot;I personally don't think this solves a lot of the problems of monopoly.&quot;</p>
<p>NTT is two-thirds owned by the government and dominates the domestic phone market with an 80 percent share.</p>
<p>It is also one of the world's biggest corporate bureaucracies with 185,000 workers, although that is down from more than 200,000 in the past.</p>
<p>The government first proposed that NTT be broken up in the 1980s and a decision has since been deferred three times.</p>
<p>NTT's case has been helped by a trend for telecoms giants to grow ever bigger by gobbling up industry rivals. NTT argued that with mega-mergers such as the planned $20 billion merger of MCI Communications Corp and British Telecommunications Plc it was unwise to break up its own power.</p>
<p>NTT president Junichiro Miyazu told a news conference that the company would fight the breakup if the government failed to abide by the compromise conditions spelt out by the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry.</p>
<p>&quot;If the conditions are not kept we may cancel out the whole plan,&quot; he said. ($1=112 yen)</p>
