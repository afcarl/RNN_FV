European debt tumbles as U.S. spooks markets.

European debt markets tumbled early on Friday, following a sharp overnight drop in U.S. Treasuries on words of caution from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, brokers said. "The sell-off is all on the back of Greenspan's comments," said Jonathan York, a futures broker at Cater Allen here.

Greenspan said the Fed must be wary when "irrational exuberance" infects stock and other asset markets because that could end up damaging the economy.

At 0830 GMT, March German Bund futures on LIFFE were down 41 basis points at 100.29 after crumpling to a low of 99.87 at the open. March gilt futures slid 25/32 to 108-31 while March Italian bond futures dropped 93 basis points to 127.68. In Paris, March notionnel were down 0.62 at 128.60.

Those losses followed a drop in the benchmark U.S. 30-year bond of as much as 2-1/2 points in New York and Tokyo trading, with much of the selling coming in Asian dealings, traders said.

Jitters before key November jobs data also infected the market, analysts said.

Though the long bond steadied in London, trading at 98-29 at 0843 GMT, for a yield of 6.584, compared with 98-16 in Tokyo and 99-29 at New York's close on Thursday, analysts expected more downward pressure.

"As it is this morning, it's going to be absolute carnage out there," York said.

"There are a lot of longs out there who came in and saw Treasury bonds way down," he said. "The market is very nervous."

March T-bond futures were at 113-12 in automated trade, down 23/32 from Chicago's daily pit settlement on Thursday.

Treasuries trailed on European spreads, with the gap between the yield on 10-year U.S. and German bonds yawning to 57 basis points from 51 at the end of European trade on Thursday.

Kirit Shah, chief market strategist at Sanwa International in London, said Greenspan was trying to squelch recent market expectations of a U.S. interest rate cut.

"Greenspan was underlining the fact the spread between the real economy and the financial markets was just too wide," he said. "He is trying to tell the markets to get real."

Nevertheless, the overnight sell-off compounded general nervousness about U.S. non-farm payroll figures due at 1330 GMT on Friday, analysts said.

"It was going to be a nervous enough day as it was without the overnight fall," York said.

A Reuter survey of economists forecasts 179,000 new non-farm payrolls in November versus a 210,000-rise, previously. The unemployment was expected to remain steady at 5.2 percent.

"The market is obviously going to be interested to see what these unemployment numbers are," said Mark Bays, futures broker at Mees Pierson Derivatives in London.

"Even if you saw a lower unemployment number, people would use that as a reason to sell the market off again," said Bays, adding that investors were eager to take profits as the year-end approached. "I don't see a great deal of upside."

Bays said U.S. stock markets would be crucial.

"If money comes out of the stock market to support the bond market then, I don't think we've got further to go," he said.
