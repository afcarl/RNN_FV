French shares plunge on Greenspan dinner comments.

PARIS 1996-12-06

French shares fell by over two percent at the opening on Friday, with all 40 blue-chip shares in the red, on a warning by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, at a dinner on Thursday after Wall Street's close, against "irrational exuberance" in financial markets.

The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 54.66 points or 2.38 percent at 2,237.84 at 0919 GMT while the CAC-40 futures contract was down at 2,244 from 2,294 on Thursday's close.

Other European markets also fell and Tokyo slipped 3.19 percent.

December French bond futures also dropped.

The Greenspan comments were the catalyst for massive profit taking with Wall Street at record highs and the CAC-40 index near its all time high of 2,360.98.

The index hit a low of 2,236.16 before bouncing back slightly in early trading.
