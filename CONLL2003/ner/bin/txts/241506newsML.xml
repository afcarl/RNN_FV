<p>Surging oil consumption in leading industrial nations will boost world oil demand this winter but rising output from non-OPEC suppliers should help quench their thirst, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday.</p>
<p>Global demand will rise to 73.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in the fourth quarter of 1996, a 100,000 bpd upward revision and up two million from the same period last year, the Paris-based agency said in its monthly oil market report.</p>
<p>Stronger than expected Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) demand in October, particularly for heating oil in the United States and Japan, was responsible for the upward adjustment, the IEA said.</p>
<p>&quot;In October, U.S. oil demand increased by 1.0 million bpd or 5.7 percent from a year earlier, mainly due to gas oil and other product deliveries...In Japan, oil demand rose by 7.7 percent due to the effect of cold weather,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The IEA left its forecast for world oil demand in 1997 unchanged at 73.7 million bpd, up 1.9 million on 1996.</p>
<p>Rising winter demand will increase the call on OPEC crude supplies plus stocks by 200,000 bpd to 26.2 million bpd in the fourth quarter of 1996 but strong non-OPEC supply growth will leave less room for the cartel next year, the agency said, making minor adjustments to last month's report.</p>
<p>It revised down its 1997 call on OPEC by 100,000 bpd to 25.2 million.</p>
<p>Non-OPEC producers are already grabbing the lion's share of the rise in demand, the IEA's end-November report showed.</p>
<p>A surge in non-OPEC output lifted world oil supply by 1.3 million bpd to 73.9 million in November versus a revised 72.6 million in October.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost 95 percent of the monthly increase occurred in non-OPEC production with the North Sea and Latin America accounting for about three-quarters of this... increase,&quot; the agency said.</p>
<p>Industry-held oil inventories in OECD member nations rose 0.3 million bpd in October compared to a 0.2 million bpd decrease in October 1995, the Paris-based IEA said.</p>
<p>It said OECD members had narrowed the stock deficit compared to 1995 levels from 83 million at the end of September to 67 million barrels at the end of October.</p>
<p>The year-on-year shortfall was equivalent to two days of forward demand with 42 million barrels of this shortfall in Atlantic Basin distillate (heating oil and diesel) stocks. European stocks alone were 12 percent below 1995 levels.</p>
<p>In contrast, crude stocks were above or close to previous year levels in all three OECD regions, the IEA said.</p>
