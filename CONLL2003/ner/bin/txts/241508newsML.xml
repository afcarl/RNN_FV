<p>Leading British shares fell sharply at the start on Friday, following British and U.S. bond markets lower after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan rattled markets overnight with anti-inflation comments, dealers said.</p>
<p>The leading FTSE 100 index opened below the key psychological 4,000 level at 3,993.5, down 57.7 points from Thursday.  </p>
<p>UK shares open sharply lower, index below =2</p>
<p>The Fed chief, in a speech on Thursday, said the central bank had to be wary of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infecting stock and other asset markets. He said that while U.S. inflation had been low recently, its future course was uncertain and the Fed had to take action before dangers developed.</p>
<p>&quot;If it weren't for Greenspan's comments, I would have thought (UK shares) had the scope to go higher,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>One of the things that has been holding the UK stock market back, dealers said, is the fear of a sudden and sharp correction on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The markets were waiting for important U.S. employment data for December, due at 1330 GMT on Friday, which could give important clues as to the course of U.S. interest rate policy.</p>
