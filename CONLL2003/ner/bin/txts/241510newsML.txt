Vietnam says still on "shoestring" despite reforms.

Vietnam has a long way to go before it establishes a healthy market economy and is still living on a financial "shoestring" despite a decade of reform, government officials told donor nations and agencies in Hanoi.

Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, whose speech at a closed-door meeting with donors was published by the official media on Friday, reeled off a litany of economic and social woes.

"The market mechanism remains rudimentary, a legal order and disciplines in business activities have not been established, the sense of market dynamism is not in place," he said.

The two-day World Bank-chaired meeting started on Thursday.

Khai warned that for all its economic growth, Vietnam was now saddled with unemployment, widespread poverty, a widening wealth gap, poor schooling and health care, crime and serious drug abuse.

He was followed by Minister of Planning and Investment Tran Xuan Gia, who told delegates at the meeting that the "country's financial capability is still on a shoestring".

Although discussion of failings is not taboo in communist Vietnam, it is rare for senior ministers to go on record with anything less than a gloss on the country's economic successes.

Diplomats said Vietnam, still one of the poorest countries in the world, hardly needed to underline its own shortcomings to win sympathy from the donor community.

Since it returned to the fold of the international financial community in 1993, Hanoi has won aid pleges totalling $6.1 billion and looks set for a further $2.0 billion at this week's meeting.

In a world of shrinking aid budgets, that is a strong signal of the West's determination to keep Vietnam on a reform path which has brought several years of stellar economic growth, analysts say.

Nevertheless, donors at the meeting warned Hanoi again and again that there must be no backsliding on trade liberalisation and that its sprawling state sector must not be allowed to continue in a muddle of waste, corruption and bureaucracy.

Hanoi was also urged to give the still-nascent private sector a chance to develop and improve the environment for foreign investors, who complain of an opaque legal framework, high costs and endless red tape.

"We add our voice to the growing chorus of voices...calling for further bold steps in trade liberalisation, state enterprise reform and creating more competitive economic environment," the United States said in a statement to the meeting.

The Communist Party agreed at a landmark meeting earlier this year to stay the course of reform, but only after intense internal debate on the pace and scope.

Conservatives argue that opening the economy and society to the outside world could loosen the party's grip on the country.

Others, concerned about a ballooning trade deficit, have suggested substituting or restricting imports, which would be contrary to the tenets of trade liberalisation.

"We would caution...against reversing recent trade liberalisation measures in the hope of cutting down imports," the United States said.

"While protection might reduce the deficit in the short run, it's an inefficient policy with huge costs to both exporters and consumers."
