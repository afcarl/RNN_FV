<p>The United States will host a special meeting on Monday at the WTO summit in Singapore to seek backing for a global pact on liberalising telecommunications, U.S. communications chief Reed Hundt said on Friday.</p>
<p>Hundt, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, told a news briefing the United States would host a closed-door meeting of around 30 countries on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Representatives would come from developed nations and the more advanced developing states.</p>
<p>The aim was to &quot;see if there is a reasonable prospect&quot; for reaching an agreement on a Global Information Initiative (GII) within the Group on Basic Telecommunications by a deadline of next February 15.</p>
<p>Singapore is hosting the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) first ministerial meeting since the global trade regulatory body replaced its predecessor, the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT), in January 1995.</p>
<p>About 4,000 officials from 160 countries are expected to attend the December 9-13 gathering in the prosperous city-state.</p>
<p>Hundt said the GII and an Information Technology Agreement (ITA) were cornerstones of a U.S. drive to liberalise global trade and use of computers and telecommunications.</p>
<p>The United States won an agreement from the other 17 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meeting in the Philippines last month for the inclusion of an Information Technology Agreement at the Singapore meeting.</p>
<p>Hundt described the ITA as &quot;the cars and trucks of the information highway&quot;, and said reports he had received made him &quot;pretty hopeful about the status of the ITA as of now&quot;.</p>
<p>He said the key issues for the Group on Basic Telecommunications included:</p>
<p>-- Dropping limits on foreign ownership of telecommunications;</p>
<p>-- Independent regulatory agencies in the different countries with transparent operations following the rule of law which would allow networks to interconnect at reasonable prices; and</p>
<p>-- Access to telecommunications markets.</p>
<p>Hundt said Washington's approach was &quot;like sitting in a hot bath and telling the others to jump in&quot;. If they complained the water was too hot, &quot;they will soon get used to it&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>He said the United States was also considering ways to induce other countries to lower their telecommunications rates.</p>
<p>Developed countries, he said, made outpayments of between $10 billion and $15 billion a year to cover the higher phone charges from developing countries.</p>
<p>Hundt said outpayments from the United States alone amounted to around $5.5 billion per year, which he described as a serious drain on U.S. balance of payments.</p>
<p>&quot;If we don't do something about it, it will be $8-to-$10 billion in a few years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the goal was for telecommunications rates to be the same for everyone, although the process of achieving this could be different from country to country.</p>
<p>Hundt is visiting the Philippines, Indonesia and Singapore on his current trip after going to Hong Kong and China on a tour six weeks ago.</p>
