UK shares tumble with gilts on Greenspan's remarks.

LONDON 1996-12-06

London's FTSE 100 index crashed below the psychologically important 4,000 level, shedding almost 1.5 percent at the start on Friday, after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan rattled markets overnight with anti-inflation comments, dealers said.

At 0837 GMT, the blue chip index was down 59.1 points to 3,992.1 as UK and U.S. debt markets slid in the wake of a sharp selloff in Asian stock markets overnight.

The Fed chief, in a speech on Thursday, said the central bank had to be wary of "irrational exuberance" infecting stock and other asset markets.
