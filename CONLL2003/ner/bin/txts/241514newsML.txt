Short-covering drives gold higher in Europe.

ZURICH 1996-12-06

Short-covering pushed gold higher in hectic early trading in Europe on Friday, and traders said the metal could break above $377 today despite an overall bearish mood.

Gold opened at $374.20/374.70, up from $369.75/370.25 at the London close. "The dollar is lower and the stock markets are coming off," one dealer at a Swiss bank said, seeing gold rising to $377.50 today on a wave of short-covering.

"There are still a lot of shorts and I have the feeling share markets are beating a retreat. I think people will have to cover their shorts before the end of the year," he said.

"All in all, however, the mood is still bearish," he added, "Producers are selling again and again."

Silver also advanced, opening seven cents higher at $4.89/4.91. One Swiss trader said silver could touch $4.95 today.

Other metals were easier. Platinum slipped to $371.50/372.50 from $372.05/373.05, while palladium shed 25 cents to $115.50/116.50.
