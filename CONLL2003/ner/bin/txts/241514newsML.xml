<p>Short-covering pushed gold higher in hectic early trading in Europe on Friday, and traders said the metal could break above $377 today despite an overall bearish mood.</p>
<p>Gold opened at $374.20/374.70, up from $369.75/370.25 at the London close. &quot;The dollar is lower and the stock markets are coming off,&quot; one dealer at a Swiss bank said, seeing gold rising to $377.50 today on a wave of short-covering.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still a lot of shorts and I have the feeling share markets are beating a retreat. I think people will have to cover their shorts before the end of the year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;All in all, however, the mood is still bearish,&quot; he added, &quot;Producers are selling again and again.&quot;</p>
<p>Silver also advanced, opening seven cents higher at $4.89/4.91. One Swiss trader said silver could touch $4.95 today.</p>
<p>Other metals were easier. Platinum slipped to $371.50/372.50 from $372.05/373.05, while palladium shed 25 cents to $115.50/116.50.</p>
