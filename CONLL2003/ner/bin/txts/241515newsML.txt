Gold chases higher on Greenspan comments.

LONDON 1996-12-06

Spot gold prices rallied sharply in early European trading on Friday as shorts rushed to cover their positions following overnight comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.

Greenspan's comments were seen to imply that the current levels of U.S. asset markets were overdone. Analysts said this suggested speculators could move out of securities into gold.  

Gold was last indicated at around $374 an ounce, well up on Thursday's London close of $369.75/$370.25. Traders said the market was now targeting resistance at $375.

"The remarks made by Greenspan could not have come at a better time for gold which was reeling under downside pressure," one trader commented.

Earlier this week gold tumbled to a three-year low of around $366 under brisk speculative selling and talk of central bank selling.

Traders said the recovery was now likely to continue. They expected further gains to be posted in later trading when the New York market opened.
