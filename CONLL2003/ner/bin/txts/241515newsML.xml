<headline>Gold chases higher on Greenspan comments.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Spot gold prices rallied sharply in early European trading on Friday as shorts rushed to cover their positions following overnight comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.</p>
<p>Greenspan's comments were seen to imply that the current levels of U.S. asset markets were overdone. Analysts said this suggested speculators could move out of securities into gold.  </p>
<p>Gold was last indicated at around $374 an ounce, well up on Thursday's London close of $369.75/$370.25. Traders said the market was now targeting resistance at $375.</p>
<p>&quot;The remarks made by Greenspan could not have come at a better time for gold which was reeling under downside pressure,&quot; one trader commented.</p>
<p>Earlier this week gold tumbled to a three-year low of around $366 under brisk speculative selling and talk of central bank selling.</p>
<p>Traders said the recovery was now likely to continue. They expected further gains to be posted in later trading when the New York market opened.</p>
