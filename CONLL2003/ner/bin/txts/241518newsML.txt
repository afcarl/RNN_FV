Australian bonds turn about face and nosedive.

Australian bonds on Friday suffered their largest one day fall since March as yields spiked 40 basis points at one stage during frantic trade, before closing up around 7.50 percent, the highest level since late October.

Analysts were unwilling to predict the next move, in front of the key U.S. labour force report for November later on Friday. "It's been a horrible, horrible day," said a trader at a European bank in Sydney.

Uncertainty over the Australian economy and monetary policy next year, combined with a plunge in U.S. Treasuries in both New York and Tokyo, left the market on the ropes. Even rumours of central bank buying failed to make much impression.

While the move was seen as wildly overdone, being exaggrated by heavy technically-driven liquidation, the market still has to negotiate the key U.S. non-farm payrolls report later on Friday.

"A lot depends on how the non-farm payrolls come out now. If that's on the high side of expectations you may get even a further bout of this before its comes back to more realistic levels," said Stephen Roberts, chief economist at UBS Australia.

November non-farm payrolls are forecast to rise 179,000 after a 210,000 increase in October, but markets have become increasingly jittery that they could be a lot stronger.

However, the local outlook has also become clouded with some analysts pointing to this week's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) numbers as a sign the economy is far from falling over, and indeed, could rebound early next year.

"Another rate cut is not a foregone conclusion. It's definitely less than an even money chance, particularly with the outlook for growth a little better," said John Kyriakopoulos, senior economist at Macquarie Bank.

Third quarter GDP, reported on Wednesday rose 0.8 percent to an annual growth rate of 3.8 percent.

The market had built up a head of steam prior to last Tuesday's Reserve Bank of Australia board meeting, anticipating a further easing when the Australian dollar was running on a six-year high against the U.S. dollar, around 82 U.S. cents.

Since then the dollar has tumbled to 79.73 U.S. cents and there is a growing realisation that a further monetary policy easing is extremely unlikely until February or March, if at all.

The Reserve Bank last cut rates by 50 basis points on November 6 to 6.50 percent.

The 10-year bond yield had already been looking fairly heavy in the last few days after several attempts to go sub-7.0 percent failed and as a three-month rally from 8.30 percent was showing definite signs of being on its last legs.

"It was very hard to build a case why bond yields should be any lower than 7.0 percent, because which ever way you cut it, you had to have weak growth continuing, and a cast iron case why the Reserve Bank was going to cut rates again," UBS's Roberts said. "The truth of the matter there is not a cast iron case and so the market is genuinely split."
