Indonesia to hold car talks outside WTO meeting.

JAKARTA 1996-12-06

Indonesia plans to further discuss its controversial car policy with Japan, the European Union and the United States on the sidelines of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) meeting in Singapore next week.

"Of course, we shall hold talks outside the official forum at the WTO meeting. We will probably find an ideal solution to the problem," the Jakarta Post on Friday quoted Trade and Industry Minister Tunky Ariwibowo as saying.

Indonesia would rather propose another round of talks than leave the dispute to the WTO arbitration panel after failed talks between Indonesia and Japan in Geneva recently, Ariwibowo said.

Talks with the United States and the European Union were continuing and were expected to end this week, the newspaper said.

Ariwibowo said discussions on Indonesia's national car policy would not be on the WTO agenda in Singapore.

Japan, the United States and the European Union filed complaints with the WTO in October, demanding Indonesia revoke its national car policy which they said breached WTO rules.

The policy gives PT Timor Putra Nasional, controlled by President Suharto's son Hutomo Mandala Putra, the sole right to develop the national car.

The policy also gives Timor tax breaks to import cars from its South Korean partner Kia Motors before opening its own plants.

Auto industry executives say the policy will allow the Timor sedan to be sold at about half the sticker price of comparable cars manufactured by joint venture automobile companies in Indonesia.

These joint ventures are dominated by Japanese firms, although U.S. and European manufacturers also operate in the country.
