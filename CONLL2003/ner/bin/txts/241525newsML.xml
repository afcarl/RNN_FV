<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell sharply in Friday morning trade, led down by the property sector as interest rate concerns shook the market.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index was down 213.17 points at 13,278.39. Turnover was HK$2.77 billion after the first hour of trade.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng properties sub-index was off 496.77 points at 26,246.28.</p>
<p>&quot;The bond market was quite weak in the States and we are just due for a pullback,&quot; said Geoff Galbraith, institutional sales trader at Nava SC Securities. &quot;It is all interest rate related and that is going to hit property stocks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the property sector, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell HK1.25 to HK$96.75 and Cheung Kong dropped HK$2.00 to HK$67.50. Henderson Land fell HK$1.00 to HK$77.50 and New World Development was off HK$1.10 at HK$49.90.</p>
<p>&quot;Tokyo dropped quite sharply today and I think that had some impact on the market,&quot; added Frederick Tsang, head of research at PrimeEast Securities.</p>
<p>Analysts said with the U.S. November jobs report due to be released later on Friday and the next Federal Reserve policy setting meeting coming up on December 17, investors were getting nervous about interest rates.</p>
<p>Overnight the U.S. long bond fell 1-15/32 to yield 6.51 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;People are cautious about what will happen tonight because a major economic indicator will be released,&quot; said Sunny Chan, senior research manager at Seapower Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has been driven by the long bond yield and if it (the yield) goes higher than 6.7 percent and stays at that level then it will take some funds out of the stock market.&quot;</p>
<p>Chan said the Hang Seng should find support at 13,000 points.</p>
<p>Despite market weakness, Mirabell International began its market debut with strong gains. Shares in the footwear retailer opened at HK$2.20 per share compared with an initial public offering price of HK$1.22.</p>
