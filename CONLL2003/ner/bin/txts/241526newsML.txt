Singapore stocks open slightly lower.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06

Singapore shares opened a shade lower on Friday and were expected to slip a little further on profit-taking ahead of the weekend.

"We've had a good run up the last few days," said one dealer. "Some of the gains will be surrendered."

The benchmark 30-share Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) stood at 2,207.51, down 6.66 points by 0140 GMT. Volume was a modest 18.7 million shares.

Most of the losses were due to early falls in drinks firm Fraser & Neave and foods group Cerebos which were both 20 cents lower at Singapore $15.30 and S$10.50 respectively.

"These were the chief reason the index was up last night," said the dealer.

Some of the most active stocks were again foreign currency stocks, including Jardine Strategic and Hong Kong-based toy maker Wah Shing.

"Non-Singapore dollar stocks have consistently outperformed in recent days," said one dealer, suggesting buying to match Asian regional indices might be supporting the shares.
