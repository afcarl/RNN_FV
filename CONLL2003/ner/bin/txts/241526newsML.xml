<p>Singapore shares opened a shade lower on Friday and were expected to slip a little further on profit-taking ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had a good run up the last few days,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;Some of the gains will be surrendered.&quot;</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-share Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) stood at 2,207.51, down 6.66 points by 0140 GMT. Volume was a modest 18.7 million shares.</p>
<p>Most of the losses were due to early falls in drinks firm Fraser &amp; Neave and foods group Cerebos which were both 20 cents lower at Singapore $15.30 and S$10.50 respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;These were the chief reason the index was up last night,&quot; said the dealer.</p>
<p>Some of the most active stocks were again foreign currency stocks, including Jardine Strategic and Hong Kong-based toy maker Wah Shing.</p>
<p>&quot;Non-Singapore dollar stocks have consistently outperformed in recent days,&quot; said one dealer, suggesting buying to match Asian regional indices might be supporting the shares.</p>
