<p>Japan's telephone giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) will be broken up into three divisions under a single holding company, the government said on Friday.</p>
<p>The decision to break up the telcoms company comes after more than a decade of debate over how Japan can best compete in the increasingly global telecommunications business.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm happy that we reached an agreement which took into account the suggestions made by the ministry's panel,&quot; Posts and Telecommunications Minister Hisao Horinouchi told a news conference.</p>
<p>High rates and lack of innovation in Japan's telcoms sector have become an increasing worry to policymakers as innovations leap ahead elsewhere, leaving Japan behind in the crucial area.</p>
<p>NTT is now two-thirds owned by the government and dominates the domestic phone market with an 80 percent share of the business.</p>
<p>The plan will carve up NTT into two regional companies and a long-distance carrier. It will also be allowed to enter the international market for the first time.</p>
<p>NTT said in a statement that the timing of the break-up has not been determined yet and that more discussion with government officials was needed.</p>
<p>But it said it hoped to break into the lucrative international market soon.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to start international telephone business as soon as possible,&quot; a company official told Reuters.</p>
<p>One of the local firms will operate in western Japan and the other in eastern Japan, while the long-distance operator will offer international services.</p>
<p>The move is the latest in a series of break-ups and alliances in the global telecommunications business.</p>
<p>NTT has long fought to avoid break-up and the holding company scheme marks a compromise between NTT management and the government.</p>
