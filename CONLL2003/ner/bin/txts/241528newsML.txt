Japan telephone giant NTT to be split up.

TOKYO 1996-12-06

Japan's telephone giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) will be broken up into three groups under a single holding company, the government said on Friday.

As part of the break-up proposal, the company will be allowed to offer international phone services for the first time.  

There has been more than a decade of debate on whether the one-time wholly state-owned company should be carved into smaller units to promote competition in Japan's telecommunications market.

High rates and lack of innovation in Japan's telcoms sector have become an increasing worry to policymakers as innovations leap ahead elsewhere, leaving Japan behind in the crucial area.

Under the government's proposal, the company will be divided into one long-distance company and two regional phone service groups.

NTT said in a statement that the timing of the breakup has not been determined yet and that more discussion with government officials was needed. NTT is now two-thirds owned by the government and dominates the domestic phone market with an 80 percent share of the business.
