LA PAZ, Bolivia 1996-12-05

Bolivia's state-owned oil company Yacimietos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) sold three of its four operating units for a total of $835 million in a round of privatisation spin-offs on Thursday.

Bidders from the U.S., Europe and Latin America came up winners, with U.S. major Amoco Corp. the biggest spender in its $307 million bid for Chaco Sam -- a YPFB exploration and production unit with a book value of just $155 million.

A largely Argentine consortium including YPF SA and Perez Companc bought Andina Sam, another YPFB exploration and production unit for $265 million. The consortium also included Plus Petrol Bolivia in a bid that was twice Andina's net worth of $130 million.

Another consortium consisting of Houston-based Enron Corp. and Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch/Shell Group spent $264 million for YPFB's transportation unit, Empresa Transportadora de Hidrocarburos SAM. YPFB had set Empresa Transportadora's book value at just $98 million.
