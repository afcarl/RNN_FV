<p>In the most surprising result of the young World Cup season, Svetlana Gladishiva of Russia raced from far back in the pack on Saturday to win a women's super G for the first victory of her 10-year career.</p>
<p>Starting 32nd, the 25-year-old from Livov recorded a time of one minute, 17.76 seconds to snatch victory from Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, who already had accepted congratulations for what would have been her second super G victory in as many tries this season.</p>
<p>Wiberg settled for second place in 1:17.97, while Carole Montillet of France, another late starter at 29th, claimed third in 1:18.11.</p>
<p>Hilde Gerg of Germany took fourth and Isolde Kostner of Italy, who finished third in a downhill race earlier Saturday, was fifth.</p>
<p>Overall World Cup leader Katja Seizinger of Germany finished ninth, her worst result of the season. She still leads Wiberg in the overall standings 414-353.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't believe I won,&quot; a beaming Gladishiva said at the finish, a moment after letting out a wild scream when she saw the scoreboard. Later, a calmer Gladishiva said: &quot;Not bad, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>The afternoon super G was the second stage of a unique double race day necessitated when a snowstorm pushed Friday's downhill back a day. Renate Goetschl of Austria won the Saturday morning downhill event.</p>
<p>After some 27 inches (68 cm) of fresh snow fell over the previous two days, the top racers scrambled to select advantageous starting positions.</p>
<p>But Gladishiva, who had little choice in when she would race, may have been helped by her late afternoon start after the sun left the course, making it colder and faster.</p>
<p>Although she had never scored higher than 13th place in a World Cup super G, the Russian had a precedent of late-start success in the event. At the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics, she took the silver medal after starting 35th.</p>
<p>Gladishiva surprised no one more than herself.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't expect even to do well and I never had the feeling I was skiing so fast,&quot; she said of her run on a fast course which favoured racers who typically score well in downhill.</p>
<p>Even after her apparent victory disappeared, Wiberg was happy with her result and her strongest start in eight World Cup seasons.</p>
<p>&quot;In super G, nothing is finished and the tradition of Vail is that the course holds, even improves,&quot; she said. &quot;My goal is to win the slalom championship. Anything after that is extra.&quot;</p>
<p>Like Gladishiva, Montillet was ecstatic with her result.</p>
<p>&quot;I expected nothing like this. It is not my event,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;This will push the momentum of the entire team,&quot; she said of her young, French compatriots. &quot;We are developing a great atmosphere.&quot;</p>
<p>The French get an additional boost from the schedule with next week's races on home turf at Val d'Isere.</p>
