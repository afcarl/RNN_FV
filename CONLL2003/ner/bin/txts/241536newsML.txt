ALPINE SKIING-GLADISHIVA STUNS WIBERG TO WIN WORLD CUP SUPER G.

VAIL, Colorado 1996-12-07

Svetlana Gladishiva of Russia scored a stunning upset in a women's World Cup super G on Saturday, racing to victory long after Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg thought she had earned the win.

With Wiberg all but set to take her place atop the victory podium, Gladishiva sped down from the 32nd start position to win with a time one minute 17.76 seconds for the first World Cup triumph of her 10-year career.

Wiberg, thwarted in her bid for a 12th World Cup victory and second super G win of the young season, settled for second place in 1:17.97. Carole Montillet of France, another late starter in 29th position, took third in 1:18.11.

Hilde Gerg of Germany claimed fourth and Isolde Kostner of Italy, who finished third in a downhill race earlier Saturday, was fifth in the Super G.

The afternoon race was part of a rare double event necessitated by a Friday snowstorm that pushed the downhill back a day. Renate Goetschl of Austria won the morning downhill.

Some 27 inches (68 cm) of fresh snow over the previous two days left the racers scrambling to puzzle out which start position would be best. Gladishiva, however, had little choice in the matter.

Seldom among the leaders in super G, the Russian was relegated to the third group and made the most of it.

The 25-year-old Gladishiva never had been better than 13th in World Cup super G, although she came from a similar late start to claim a silver medal in the event at the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics.

"I can't believe I won," Gladishiva said, moments after a wild scream when she saw the scoreboard result.

Then, laughing, she added: "Not bad, huh?"
