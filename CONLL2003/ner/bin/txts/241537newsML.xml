<headline>SOCCER-MONACO GO TOP DESPITE BEING HELD TO GOALLESS DRAW.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-12-07</dateline>

<p>Monaco failed to take full advantage of the shock defeat by arch rivals Paris St Germain by Nancy 24 hours earlier when they were held to a goalless draw at home by Guingamp on Saturday.</p>
<p>A win would have allowed in-form Monaco to seize a two-point lead over PSG.</p>
<p>But Monaco, who had won their last four league matches, were unable to break down a solid Guingamp defence and had to be content with taking over at the top of the table on goal difference.</p>
<p>Bastia moved into third spot with a 1-0 win over bottom-of-the-table Nice while Bordeaux were beaten 2-1 by champions Auxerre.</p>
<p>Tuesday's 2-0 victory over Hamburg in the UEFA Cup was Monaco's sixth consecutive victory but club president Henri Biancheri had no complaints over his side's failure to beat Guingamp.</p>
<p>&quot;There is always some fatigue after a UEFA Cup match&quot;, he said. &quot;Guingamp played the match they had to play. They deserved their draw.&quot;</p>
<p>Monaco and PSG have an almost identical league record. Both have 42 points with 12 wins, six draws and one defeat.</p>
<p>But Monaco appear to have the easier fixtures before the end of the year. They play host to third division Troyes in the League Cup and Cannes in the league while Paris travel to Lyon and Nantes.</p>
<p>Another goal by Yugoslav striker Anton Drobnjak was enough to give Bastia their win over Nice.</p>
<p>Bordeaux took an eighth minute lead over Auxerre through Johan Micoud but it was shortlived.</p>
<p>Lilian Laslandes equalised five minutes later and then scorned the chance of giving his side the lead by missing a penalty.</p>
<p>Auxerre, who looked weary after their European champions' league win over Glasgow Rangers on Wednesday, had to wait until the 79th minute to snatch the winner through Fabrice Lepaul.</p>
<p>Metz and Marseille drew 1-1, both goals coming from penalties. French international Robert Pires converted Metz's spot kick in the 38th minute and Eric Roy replied with 17 minutes left.</p>
