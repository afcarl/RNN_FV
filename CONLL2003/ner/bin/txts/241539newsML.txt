ALPINE SKIING-MEN'S SEASON-OPENING WORLD CUP DOWNHILL CANCELLED.

WHISTLER, British Columbia 1996-12-07

The race jury was forced to call off the men's season-opening World Cup downhill at Whistler Mountain on Saturday after wet snow and foggy conditions forced cancellation of all practice runs.

Rules call for at least one training run to be completed before a World Cup downhill race can be staged and officials had hoped to get in a training session Saturday morning and a race later in the day.

The first three scheduled training runs were all cancelled by heavy snow and poor visibility. On Saturday, soft snow and fog left the Dave Murray Downhill Course too dangerous to traverse at high speeds, officials declared.

World Cup officials said the downhill will be made up at a later date in Europe, possibly next weekend with a double downhill at Val d'Isere, France.

"It's disappointing for everybody, especially the course workers," said Frenchman Luc Alphond, the defending World Cup downhill champion.

"It's always hard to cancel the first race because everybody was under pressure after summer training. But that's ski sport."

This was the first year of a 10-year agreement under which the downhill season was to have opened in North America.

Organisers remain hopeful that they can salvage something of the weekend competition by holding a Super G race on Sunday, weather and course preparation permitting. The Super G does not require a practice run.

Austrian Patrick Ortlieb supported the decision to cancell the downhill.

"There was no chance to ski," Ortlieb said. "Maybe we could make training but for the race it was too dangerous."
