<p>Renate Goetschl of Austria avoided a near spill a few meters from the finish to claim the first World Cup downhill victory of her career on Saturday.</p>
<p>A 20-year-old in her fifth season, Goetschl won with relative ease over pre-race favourite Katja Seizinger of Germany, the overall World Cup leader.</p>
<p>Goetschl posted a winning time of one minute 47.71 seconds, while Seizinger, who won the season's first downhill last week, clocked 1:48.53.</p>
<p>Islode Kostner of Italy finished third in 1:48.91, just ahead of Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria in 1:49.13. American Megan Gerety rounded out the top five in 1:49.26.</p>
<p>The race was the first of a novel Saturday double event on the same hill, the result by a Friday snowstorm that forced a day's delay in the downhill. The super G originally scheduled for Saturday was to be run later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Leading at every interval, Goetschl found her moment of truth on the steep face leading to the finish. Flying far off the lip, she landed off balance on one ski, the other flailing off to the side. The Austrian somehow righted herself and sped safely to the finish.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a big surprise since I never had gone that fast in practice nor sailed that far off the bump,&quot; said Goetschl. &quot;I'm just happy I made it.&quot;</p>
<p>The woman who four years earlier at age 16 became the youngest person to win a World Cup race -- a slalom at Lillehammer, Norway -- was particularly delighted by her first downhill victory.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the big achievement, since downhill is the big event for an Austrian. Our team did not do well last week, so we needed to prove a point.&quot;</p>
<p>Goetschl now has victories in three disciplines -- downhill, Super G and slalom, along with a combined.</p>
<p>&quot;My goal now is to win a giant slalom, since I want to be good in all disciplines. But it is downhill, with all the excitement of speed, I enjoy the most.&quot;</p>
<p>Seizinger, who maintained her downhill lead and padded her advantage in the overall standings, professed to be satisfied with her result.</p>
<p>&quot;It is good whenever I am in the top three. I don't feel any pressure to win,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Kostner, who fell in last week's opening downhill at Lake Louise, Canada, and raced poorly in super G, was happiest of all.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a great result for me, because I didn't think I skied so well, not nearly my best.&quot;</p>
<p>On a course inundated with 25 inches (63 cm) of fresh snow over the past two days, racers played a strategic game of hop-scotch with starting positions in an attempt to gauge the fastest track.</p>
<p>In a departure from the norm, Goetschl started 26th, Seizinger 27th, Kostner 30th and Meissnitzer 24th. However, all agreed that with weather conditions constant throughout, start position ultimately played no real role in the outcome.</p>
