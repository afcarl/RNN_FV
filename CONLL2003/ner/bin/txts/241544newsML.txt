Juergen Klinsmann scored his 100th Bundesliga goal on Saturday to propel Bayern Munich to a 1-0 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach.

The German international striker, who has endured a lean season, scored in the 51st minute before a home crowd of 63,000, beating goalkeeper Uwe Kamps from 10 metres out after a pass from Mario Basler.

Bayern now enter the winter break at the top of the table for the 10th time since they entered the Bundesliga in 1965, ending the autumn season with 36 points, two more than champions Borussia Dortmund.

Coach Giovanni Trapattoni said: "Being autum champion is not enough, the result comes at the end of May. I am happy but the team has to improve. Despite having many injuries in the autumn season we are standing in first place. But I believe we can still improve."

After the match Borussia Moenchengladbach, second from bottom in the table, dismissed coach Bernd Krauss.

A bleak series of six games without a win or a goal and no away goals in nine matches cost Krauss his job. His contract was due to run until 1998 and it is not yet know who will replace him.

"We agreed this morning with Bernd Krauss. His contract will be cancelled in January," said manager Rolf Ruessman.

Champions Borussia Dortmund, who have struggled with injuries this season and were fourth before the weekend, beat Cologne 3-1 and lie second in the table ahead of Bayer Leverkusen on goal difference.

After trailing 1-0 at halftime Dortmund stormed back with two goals from Heiko Herrlich.

Coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said: "(In the first half) there were practically no goal chances. The 0-1 shortly before halftime was probably a good shock for us. After the break every player improved 100 percent, so we earned the win in the end."

Herrlich and captain Michael Zorc saved the champions in the closing phase from an embarrassing defeat against Cologne.

Herrlich scored in the 69th minute in front of 52,000 spectators to equalise and three minutes later Zorc put Dortmund ahead. Four minutes before the final whistle Herrlich confirmed the victory with his second goal.

Stuttgart are now in fourth place after losing 2-0 to Arminia Bielefeld, their fourth defeat this season.

"We spoiled the good mood with our game," said defender Thorsten Legat.

Bayer Leverkusen's chance to top the table vanished on Friday when an 89th minute goal from Dariusz Wosz earned Bochum a 2-2 home draw. Bochum are unbeaten at home since December last year.

Karlsruhe boosted their morale on Friday, only three days after losing in the UEFA Cup, with a 3-0 victory over Freiburg and are now fifth in the standings.
