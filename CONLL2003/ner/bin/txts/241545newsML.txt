Frenchman Patrick Vieira rescued English premier league leaders Arsenal by blasting his first goal for the club in injury time to salvage a 2-2 draw against Derby on Saturday.

Arsenal had been rocked by strikes from forwards Dean Sturridge and Darryl Powell in the 62nd and 71st minutes which thrust Derby 2-1 ahead at Highbury.

But the London club, who were given the lead by a diving header from captain Tony Adams on the stroke of halftime, launched a desperate late offensive in which they conjured an equaliser.

French under-21 midfielder Vieria, earlier booked for the seventh time since his debut in mid-September, crashed an unstoppable left-foot drive through a crowded penalty area to save the day for Arsenal.

The draw took Arsenal to 34 points, four points clear at the top on a day when Liverpool suffered a 1-0 defeat against Sheffield Wednesday at Anfield and Wimbledon leap-frogged over them into second place.

Sheffield Wednesday striker Guy Whittingham made the most of a below par display by Liverpool when he scored the only goal midway through the first half to inflict their first home league defeat of the season.

Wimbledon won 3-1 at Sunderland to extend their unbeaten league and cup run to 18 games, an astonishing transformation in fortunes which started after they lost their first three league games of the season.

Strikes by Efan Ekoku in the eighth and 29th minutes and an 89th minute goal by fellow forward Dean Holdsworth secured victory for Wimbledon.

Wimbledon, who have confounded expectations by a combination of spirit, determination and improving skills under the shrewd coaching of manager Joe Kinnear, are now level on 31 points with third-placed Liverpool. Both teams have a game in hand on the leaders.

Aston Villa, 1-0 winners over Southampton thanks to a first-half goal from midfielder Andy Townsend, are in fourth place on 30.

Newcastle, who play at bottom-of-the-table Notingham Forest on Monday, are fifth with 29.

Italian Gianfranco Zola scored his first goal for Chelsea since his recent move from Parma as his new club secured a 2-2 draw at home to Everton.

He scored with a 12th minute free kick to give Chelsea the lead before Everton hit back within the next 14 minutes through goals from striker Michael Branch and Russian international winger Andrei Kanchelskis.

Zola's countryman Gianluca Vialli hit his eighth goal of the season in the 55th minute to put the London side back on terms.

Norwegian striker Steffen Iversen made his debut for Tottenham at Coventry, but it was England forward Teddy Sherringham and Andy Sinton who gave the visitors -- beaten in their previous three games -- a 2-1 success.
