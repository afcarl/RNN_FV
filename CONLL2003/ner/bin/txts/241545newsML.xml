<p>Frenchman Patrick Vieira rescued English premier league leaders Arsenal by blasting his first goal for the club in injury time to salvage a 2-2 draw against Derby on Saturday.</p>
<p>Arsenal had been rocked by strikes from forwards Dean Sturridge and Darryl Powell in the 62nd and 71st minutes which thrust Derby 2-1 ahead at Highbury.</p>
<p>But the London club, who were given the lead by a diving header from captain Tony Adams on the stroke of halftime, launched a desperate late offensive in which they conjured an equaliser.</p>
<p>French under-21 midfielder Vieria, earlier booked for the seventh time since his debut in mid-September, crashed an unstoppable left-foot drive through a crowded penalty area to save the day for Arsenal.</p>
<p>The draw took Arsenal to 34 points, four points clear at the top on a day when Liverpool suffered a 1-0 defeat against Sheffield Wednesday at Anfield and Wimbledon leap-frogged over them into second place.</p>
<p>Sheffield Wednesday striker Guy Whittingham made the most of a below par display by Liverpool when he scored the only goal midway through the first half to inflict their first home league defeat of the season.</p>
<p>Wimbledon won 3-1 at Sunderland to extend their unbeaten league and cup run to 18 games, an astonishing transformation in fortunes which started after they lost their first three league games of the season.</p>
<p>Strikes by Efan Ekoku in the eighth and 29th minutes and an 89th minute goal by fellow forward Dean Holdsworth secured victory for Wimbledon.</p>
<p>Wimbledon, who have confounded expectations by a combination of spirit, determination and improving skills under the shrewd coaching of manager Joe Kinnear, are now level on 31 points with third-placed Liverpool. Both teams have a game in hand on the leaders.</p>
<p>Aston Villa, 1-0 winners over Southampton thanks to a first-half goal from midfielder Andy Townsend, are in fourth place on 30.</p>
<p>Newcastle, who play at bottom-of-the-table Notingham Forest on Monday, are fifth with 29.</p>
<p>Italian Gianfranco Zola scored his first goal for Chelsea since his recent move from Parma as his new club secured a 2-2 draw at home to Everton.</p>
<p>He scored with a 12th minute free kick to give Chelsea the lead before Everton hit back within the next 14 minutes through goals from striker Michael Branch and Russian international winger Andrei Kanchelskis.</p>
<p>Zola's countryman Gianluca Vialli hit his eighth goal of the season in the 55th minute to put the London side back on terms.</p>
<p>Norwegian striker Steffen Iversen made his debut for Tottenham at Coventry, but it was England forward Teddy Sherringham and Andy Sinton who gave the visitors -- beaten in their previous three games -- a 2-1 success.</p>
