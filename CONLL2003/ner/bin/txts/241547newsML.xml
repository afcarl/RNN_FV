<p>Boris Becker has a chance to pick up one of the thickest pay packets of his career when he takes on defending champion Goran Ivanisevic in Sunday's Grand Slam Cup final -- $1.875 million.</p>
<p>But it will not be easy money for the German against the big-serving Croat who came back from two sets behind to reach the final with a 6-7 2-6 6-3 6-2 6-4 defeat of Russia's French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov on Saturday.</p>
<p>Becker, who booked his place in the final after a straight-sets defeat of Britain's Tim Henman, was guaranteed $250,000 for just turning up at the richest tournament in the game because he had won a grand slam this year -- the Australian Open.</p>
<p>The winner of Sunday's match is guaranteed $1.625 million. Ivanisevic has a chance to boost his earnings from five appearances in Munich to an astonishing $4.425 million.</p>
<p>The statistics are in Becker's favour. The German has won nine of their 15 clashes since 1990 but Ivanisevic won their last meeting in the Belgium city of Antwerp earlier this year which was also played on an indoor court.</p>
<p>After losing the opening two sets, Ivanisevic finally got his big serve and powerful groundstrokes into action against Kafelnikov.</p>
<p>The key moments of the match came in the middle of the decisive fifth set which had humour as well as some fierce exchanges.</p>
<p>Ivanisevic broke serve to lead 4-3 but Kafelinokov broke back in the next game to level.</p>
<p>After the Croat had smashed his racket in anger, Kafelnikov came back onto the court before the next game with two rackets. Ivanisevic joined in on the joke and both players then used two rackets to play a point to the delight of the crowd.</p>
<p>The action then became serious again and Ivanisevic effectively clinched the match with another break in the next game to lead 5-4 and then served out for the match after two hours and 21 minutes.</p>
<p>Henman's lucrative run at the event ended because of the killer instinct of three-times Wimbledon champion Boris Becker.</p>
<p>The Briton, who doubled his earnings for the year by reaching the last four, put up an admirable display in front of 11,000 German fans. But it was not enough to stop an in-form Becker winning 7-6 6-3 6-1.</p>
<p>Although 22-year-old Henman at times matched the German in terms of powerful serving, crisp volleying and accuracy from the baseline, Becker, seven years his senior, used every bit of his experience to excel on the big points.</p>
<p>&quot;Being in that situation for many years you get a coolness (about the pressure). Sometimes you are already two points ahead,&quot; Becker said. &quot;If you're a good player, you sense those moments and you want to make sure that you win those points.</p>
<p>&quot;For the first set and a half, it really was a close battle.&quot;</p>
<p>For a while in the first and second sets, Henman looked capable of producing one of the best results in British tennis for decades. But he faded at the end. The Briton said Becker's consistency had been a major factor.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a consistency thing. When I am playing some of my best tennis, I'm able to stay with somebody of his calibre,&quot; Henman said. &quot;He's probably able to continue playing like that for four or five sets.&quot;</p>
<p>The British number one took his leave of the tournament with $431,250 in his pocket after the most lucrative week of his life. More importantly, he has gained invaluable experience for the future.</p>
<p>&quot;He has improved already a lot in the last year and an half. He came from nowhere to be ranked now in the top 30,&quot; said Becker who will earn $1.875 million if he wins Sunday's final.</p>
<p>&quot;He apparently likes to play on a fast court so Wimbledon, one day he may win.</p>
