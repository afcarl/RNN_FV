<p>Renate Goetschl of Austria upset Germany's Katja Seizinger on Saturday to win the the World Cup season's second women's downhill race.</p>
<p>Goetschl posted a winning time of one minute 47.71 seconds, well ahead of Seizinger, the current World Cup overall leader who finished second in 1:48.53.</p>
<p>Islode Kostner of Italy took the third spot on the podium in 1:48.91. Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria was fourth and Megan Gerety of the United States finished fifth.</p>
<p>The weather-delayed downhill was run early on Saturday as the first part of a unique double-race schedule after a Friday snowstorm caused a one-day postponement of the downhill. A Super G will be staged on the same slope later Saturday afternoon.  </p>
<p>Goetschl previously posted wins in slalom and super G, but a second place four seasons ago had been her best career downhill finish.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the 20-year-old Austrian in her fifth World Cup season left nothing to chance, charging down Vail Mountain at a pace that put her ahead at every interval.</p>
<p>Goetschl's only bad moment came on the steep closing face just seconds from the finish. Flying far off the lip, she landed with one ski flung far out to the side, but righted herself and sped on to the finish.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a big surprise since I never had gone that fast in practice nor sailed that far off the bump,&quot; a delighted Goetschl said. &quot;I'm just happy I made it.&quot;</p>
