<p>China made a promising debut on the freestyle skiing world cup circuit in an aerials event in the French resort of Tignes on Saturday.</p>
<p>While the Chinese failed to gain a place in the men's final, they had two in the top 10 of the women's competition, Cuo Dan finishing a respectable seventh and Xu Nannan ninth.</p>
<p>But overall, it was France and Canada who dominated the day.</p>
<p>Alexis Blanc and Sebastien Foucras gave France a one-two finish in the first aerials competition of the season.</p>
<p>Blanc collected his seventh career World Cup win with a two jump combined score of 238.36 points, easily beating Foucras, the overall World Cup aerials champion, who was a distant second with 223.60.</p>
<p>Canada's Jeff Bean, who had never finished higher than ninth in a World Cup event, made his first trip to the podium taking third place with a mark of 209.96.</p>
<p>Veronica Brenner of Canada, who picked up her first career victory at Tignes last year, made it two wins in a row at the French resort taking first in the women's competition with a score of 170.42.</p>
<p>Swiss skiers occupied the other two places on the podium, Karin Kuster taking second with 160.55 narrowly ahead of Evelyne Leu with 160.36.</p>
