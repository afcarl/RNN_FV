<p>South Africa's trip to Kanpur for the third test against India has given former England test cricketer Bob Woolmer the chance of a sentimental return to his birthplace.</p>
<p>Woolmer was born in the northern city of Kanpur when his father worked there for an insurance compnay and was himself an active cricketer.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a sentimental journey...A visit to India is always an intriguing experience,&quot; Woolmer, now the South African coach, said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Woolmer, 48, played 19 tests for England between 1975 and 1981. His first cricketing sojurn to India was as a member of Tony Greig's England side in 1976-77.</p>
<p>His father Clarence Woolmer represented United Province, now renamed Uttar Pradesh, in India's Ranji Trophy national championship and captained the state during 1949.</p>
<p>Now aged 86, Woolmer senior lives with his son in Cape Town.</p>
<p>Woolmer's memories of Kanpur are few and blurred.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't remember much of the place,&quot; he said. &quot;I came here on zero and left at three (aged three) when my father was transferred to Calcutta where I spent another four and half years.</p>
<p>&quot;But I do remember we had a cobra snake in the basement of our house. Also that my father bought a bicycle and when we rode over a hose pipe it broke into two.&quot;</p>
<p>Woolmer said the hospital where he was born is close to the stadium where the India-South Africa test will be played.</p>
