BARCELONA, Dec 7 - FIFA rubber-stamped soccer's worst kept secret on Saturday when it announced that Japan will stage the World Cup final in 2002 and South Korea will host the opening match.

Those recommendations were made in Zurich a month ago when FIFA refused to say what they were. But details leaked out within hours of them being made by the World Cup study group.

The finals, the first in the competition's 66-year history to be jointly staged by two countries, will be known as the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea-Japan. It will have one emblem but there may be a separate mascot for each country.

South Korea and Japan will each have their own local organising committees but there will also be a coordination committee headed by FIFA to oversee the event.

Both countries will qualify automatically for the finals, the preliminary round draw for which will take place in Japan with the draw for the finals being held in South Korea.

The third-place play-off match will also take place in South Korea.

With 32 teams taking part, there will be a total of 64 matches, split equally between the two countries.

Ken Naganuma, president of the Japan Football Association, said he was satisfied that the points agreed in Zurich a month ago had been endorsed by the executive committee.

"We will be working very closely with our co-hosts and I am sure the tournament will be a great success," he said. He added that the current total of 15 Japanese cities bidding to be a host venue would be reduced to 10 by the end of this month.

The finals will almost certainly be played over a five-week span in June and July, the rainy season in both countries.
