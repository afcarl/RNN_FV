<p>BARCELONA, Dec 7 - FIFA rubber-stamped soccer's worst kept secret on Saturday when it announced that Japan will stage the World Cup final in 2002 and South Korea will host the opening match.</p>
<p>Those recommendations were made in Zurich a month ago when FIFA refused to say what they were. But details leaked out within hours of them being made by the World Cup study group.</p>
<p>The finals, the first in the competition's 66-year history to be jointly staged by two countries, will be known as the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea-Japan. It will have one emblem but there may be a separate mascot for each country.</p>
<p>South Korea and Japan will each have their own local organising committees but there will also be a coordination committee headed by FIFA to oversee the event.</p>
<p>Both countries will qualify automatically for the finals, the preliminary round draw for which will take place in Japan with the draw for the finals being held in South Korea.</p>
<p>The third-place play-off match will also take place in South Korea.</p>
<p>With 32 teams taking part, there will be a total of 64 matches, split equally between the two countries.</p>
<p>Ken Naganuma, president of the Japan Football Association, said he was satisfied that the points agreed in Zurich a month ago had been endorsed by the executive committee.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be working very closely with our co-hosts and I am sure the tournament will be a great success,&quot; he said. He added that the current total of 15 Japanese cities bidding to be a host venue would be reduced to 10 by the end of this month.</p>
<p>The finals will almost certainly be played over a five-week span in June and July, the rainy season in both countries.</p>
