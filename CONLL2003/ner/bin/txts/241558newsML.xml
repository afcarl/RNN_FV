<p>Joao Havelange, the 80-year-old president of FIFA, said on Saturday he will retire from the position he has held since 1974 following the World Cup finals in France in 1998.</p>
<p>The Brazilian, who turned 80 in May and who said only last month he had no intention of quitting as the top man in world soccer, said he had changed his mind, &quot;after long and careful thought.&quot;</p>
<p>Havalange told a news conference at the end of a FIFA executive committee meeting: &quot;I have been thinking about this for some time and I am now ready to go.</p>
<p>I don't want to stay on until people say I am gaga. I have my health, all my intellectual abilities and my state of mind is fully intact. The difficult thing in life is not arriving but knowing when to go.&quot;</p>
<p>FIFA has been revolutionised since Havelange succeeded Sir Stanley Rouse of England in 1974.</p>
<p>Under the Brazilian's baleful countenance, new tournaments have flourished at all age groups and at all levels. The development of women's football and an expansion in the World Cup from 16 teams in 1974 to the 32 teams that will compete in France and beyond has confirmed soccer as the world's number one sport.</p>
<p>Often criticised as an autocratic dictator, Havelange has also played his hand time and again as an astute and clever politician, often staying one and sometimes two steps ahead of the opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;My mission as president of FIFA is almost at an end and I will leave with a clear conscience that in the 24 years that I will have served FIFA and world football my administration, with the help of my supporters, has changed the sport throughout the world.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he started to think seriously about retiring after a banquet held by FIFA to mark his birthday in May. He said a speech by Lennart Johansson of Sweden, president of UEFA, underlying the need for unity in football had led him to &quot;meditate&quot; about his position.</p>
<p>It is no secret that Johansson, who is also a FIFA vice-president, and Havelange are not the closest of allies, and Johansson will be among those now looking to succeed his old foe.</p>
<p>Issa Hayatou of Cameroon, another FIFA vice-president, is also a certain candidate and they could well be joined by two dark horses.</p>
<p>Franz Beckenbauer, who skippered West Germany to victory in the 1974 World Cup and managed them to success in 1990, could well declare an interest. Another likely candidate could be Sepp Blatter, FIFA's general secretary whose contract with them expires after the World Cup finals.</p>
<p>Asked about  his views on a possible successor, Havelange said: &quot;There is no way I will intervene or make any statements about the selection of who succeeds me and I will applaud whoever is chosen.&quot;</p>
