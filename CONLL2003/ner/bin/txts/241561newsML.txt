LANDOVER, Maryland 1996-12-07

Jagr, who has 11 goals during a seven-game streak, scored the first and last Pittsburgh goals. But he was serving a 10-minute misconduct penalty for throwing his stick when Lemieux and Nedved scored.

"I was very happy when I was sitting on the penalty bench and we scored two goals to get the lead," Jagr said. "It was awesome, I felt like I should stay there all period."

The injury-ravaged Caps were held scoreless in five powerplay chances and are 0-for-15 in their last five games with the man advantage.

In Chicago, Marc Bureau scored with 6:17 left in the third period to help the Montreal Canadiens break a four-game winless streak with a 3-1 victory over the Blackhawks.
