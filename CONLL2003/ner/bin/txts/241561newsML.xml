<p>Mario Lemieux took over eighth place on the NHL's all-time scoring list and Jaromir Jagr notched his league-leading 25th and 26th goals as the Pittsburgh Penguins skated to a 5-3 victory over the Washington Capitals on Friday.</p>
<p>Lemieux and Petr Nedved scored 2:04 apart to break a third-period tie as Pittsburgh extended its unbeaten streak to six games. After starting the season 0-11-1 on the road, the Penguins have won three straight away from home.</p>
<p>Lemieux's 11th goal of the season 3:13 into the final period snapped a 2-2 tie. He beat Capitals goalie Olaf Kolzig with a backhander from in front of the net for his 574th career goal, moving Lemieux past Mike Bossy on the NHL's all-time goals list.</p>
<p>Jagr, who has 11 goals during a seven-game streak, scored the first and last Pittsburgh goals. But he was serving a 10-minute misconduct penalty for throwing his stick when Lemieux and Nedved scored.</p>
<p>&quot;I was very happy when I was sitting on the penalty bench and we scored two goals to get the lead,&quot; Jagr said. &quot;It was awesome, I felt like I should stay there all period.&quot;</p>
<p>The injury-ravaged Caps were held scoreless in five powerplay chances and are 0-for-15 in their last five games with the man advantage.</p>
<p>In New York, Bill Berg scored his second goal of the game with 27 seconds left in the third period to lift the Rangers to a 6-5 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs.</p>
<p>The victory extended New York's unbeaten streak to five games, while Toronto suffered its ninth straight road loss.</p>
<p>With time winding down, Wayne Gretzky picked up a puck that was mishandled by rookie goaltender Marcel Cousineau behind the net. He passed it out front to Berg, who snapped it high into the left corner of the net for the game-winner.</p>
<p>Gretzky had two goals and two assists for a four-point night. He tied the game at 5-5 with with a blast from the left faceoff circle with just over three minutes left.</p>
<p>The Leafs had stormed back from two goals down with three unanswered tallies, taking the lead for the first time early in the third period when Todd Warriner beat Mike Richter.</p>
<p>In Dallas, Dale Hawerchuk and Mikael Renberg scored 42 seconds apart to snap a third-period tie and Renberg added an insurance tally in the final minute as the Philadelphia Flyers doubled up the Stars 6-3.</p>
<p>Dallas rallied for a 3-3 tie when Mike Modano and Derian Hatcher scored in a 27-second span early in the third period.</p>
<p>But Hawerchuk put the Flyers ahead for good at 11:35 when he took a pass from Rod Brind'Amour and scored off his own rebound.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Marc Bureau scored with 6:17 left in the third period to help the Montreal Canadiens break a four-game winless streak with a 3-1 victory over the Blackhawks.</p>
<p>Bureau broke a 1-1 tie when he snapped a wrist shot from the left faceoff circle through the pads of Chicago goaltender Ed Belfour. Valeri Bure added in insurance tally for Montreal with 2:24 left in the third.</p>
<p>Chris Chelios scored the lone Blackhawks goal, tying the game with a powerplay tally at 2:38 of the second period.</p>
<p>Montreal goaltender Pat Jablonski made 27 saves.</p>
<p>At Colorado, Geoff Courtnall had a pair of powerplay tallies and Grant Fuhr stopped Peter Forsberg on a penalty shot in the third periuod as the St Louis Blues hung on for a 4-3 victory over the Avalanche.</p>
<p>Courtnall banged home the rebound of a Harry York slap shot from the left point with 6:17 remaining, beating Patrick Roy for a 4-2 Blues lead.</p>
<p>The Avalanche cut the margin to 4-3 on a Keith Jones goal with just 2:11 left in regulation. Fuhr, who earlier denied Forsberg's penalty shot, preserved the win by stopping a Forsberg wrist shot with 30 seconds to play.</p>
<p>In Buffalo, Dominik Hasek stopped 39 shots for the Sabres and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks had the go-ahead goal disallowed in the final minute as the teams settled for a 1-1 tie.</p>
<p>Dmitri Mironov scored the apparent tie-breaking goal with 46.8 seconds to go in the third period when he cut across the low slot and put a backhander through Hasek's pads. But the goal was disallowed when the video replay judge ruled that Anaheim's Paul Kariya had his left skate in the crease.</p>
<p>Anaheim's J.F. Jomphe and Buffalo's Derek Plante traded first-period goals. Guy Hebert made 22 stops for the Ducks.</p>
<p>In Edmonton, Doug Weight scored twice and Ryan Smyth added a goal and two assists to lead the Oilers to a 5-2 triumph over the Ottawa Senators.</p>
