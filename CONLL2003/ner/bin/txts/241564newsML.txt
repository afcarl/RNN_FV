MEXICAN CITY BANS SWEARING AT SOCCER MATCHES.

GUADALAJARA, Mexico 1996-12-06

To the relief of long-suffering referees, soccer fans will be banned from swearing at soccer matches in Mexico's second largest city.

The Guadalajara city fathers, concerned about lewd insults by spectators, issued the ban on Thursday, officials said.

Offenders will face stiff fines of 30 days of the minimum wage, or about $100, and 36-hour jail sentences.

The conservative, pro-church National Action Party, which has ruled Guadalajara for almost two years, has already forbidden foul language in market places and banned city employees from wearing mini-skirts.
