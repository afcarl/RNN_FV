SOCCER-GULLIT DEFENDS HIS ITALIAN IMPORTS.

Ruud Gullit, whose cosmopolitan Chelsea team epitomises the changing face of English soccer, was in bemused and defensive mood on Saturday.

The London club's Dutch player-manager was baffled at how his multi-million-dollar side failed to beat Everton in the English premier league, but at the same time defended his investment in foreign talent.

Chelsea drew 2-2 at home, leading after 12 minutes through their newest Italian import Gianfranco Zola, but needing an equaliser from his compatriot Gianluca Vialli to secure a point that left them seventh in the table, 10 points behind leaders Arsenal.

"We are all really amazed that the winner just didn't want to go in," said Gullit, who missed two great chances himself and saw Vialli and Zola hit the bar.

"It's incredible. It was exactly the same (in the 1-1 draw) against Newcastle two weeks ago and that's four points we have let slip.

"The team got everything right but the ball just wouldn't go in and you can't coach against that. We just hope to break the run soon.

"Overall I am satisfied with the team's reaction in the second half when there was much more effort and you could see from the reaction of the crowd that they were happy with the way we played."

Chelsea's draw was achieved at a cost -- Vialli pulled a hamstring near the end and could be out until Christmas.

He scored the equaliser with his eighth goal of the season after Zola, the club's 4.5 million pounds sterling ($7.4 million) signing from Parma last month, had put Chelsea ahead with his first.

Zola, renowned at Parma as a ball-juggling genius with impressive technical skills, completes a trio of Italians at Chelsea, whose squad also contains a Russian, a Romanian, a Norwegian and a Frenchman.

Gullit dropped his third Italian, midfielder Roberto Di Matteo, for the Everton match but defended his investment in the three players.

"There's been a lot of discussion about the Italians coming to Chelsea and pushing out the British players," said Gullit.

"But they have made a major impact. They are something special for the premier (league). Everybody is very happy to see them play so I don't understand the discussion.

"If they play like this it can only be good for the premier league. They don't have to prove anything any more and I hope that now they will be accepted."

Chelsea's overseas contingent contrasts with London neighbours Wimbledon, whose almost wholly British squad have confounded expectations by taking the club to second in the table.

Manager Joe Kinnear paid heartfelt tribute to his players after seeing them extend their unbeaten league and cup run to 18 matches with a 3-1 win at Sunderland.

"They amaze me every week with this incredible desire they have to do well.

"We are very proud of this unbeaten record and it is an incentive for us to keep on doing well because we keep on reading that we're going to get beaten. But we just keep on going."

Wimbledon are four points behind the leaders with a game in hand. Said Kinnear: "This is the strongest squad I've had in my seven years here. If we are in the same position with six or seven games to go I believe we would be the hardest team in the country to beat."
