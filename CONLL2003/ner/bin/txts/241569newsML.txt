SOCCER-MCCOIST SETS SCORING RECORD WITH DOUBLE STRIKE.

GLASGOW 1996-12-07

Ally McCoist became the Scottish league's record goalscorer with a double strike in five second-half minutes as Glasgow Rangers beat Hibernian 4-3 on Saturday.

McCoist first put Rangers level after 70 minutes when he just beat goalkeeper Jim Leighton to a cross from Dane Brian Laudrup and headed home to equal Gordon Wallace's post-World War Two mark of 264 strikes.

Five minutes later, England midfielder Paul Gascoigne drove in an inviting cross and McCoist thrust out a boot to put Rangers ahead and claim the record of 265 for himself.

It was his 243rd goal for Rangers, with his other 22 coming during his spell at St Johnstone.

McCoist has now scored 16 times this season, and his two goals against the Edinburgh side could have a major impact on the premier division title race.

With Celtic losing 2-1 at Motherwell, Rangers are now eight points clear and on course for a record-equalling ninth successive title.

Yet before McCoist's intervention, Hibernian had threatened to spring a major upset, taking the lead through Keith Wright after 20 minutes.

Rangers equalised in the 34th minute thanks to Ian Ferguson but Hibs restored their advantage six minutes later through Darren Jackson.

However, McCoist's double blow and a fourth goal after 82 minutes by Laudrup effectively swung the game back to Rangers.

Celtic, who trailed 1-0, equalised through substitute Chris Hay with seven minutes left, only for Motherwell to snatch victory when Ian Ross slid the ball home with only seconds remaining.
