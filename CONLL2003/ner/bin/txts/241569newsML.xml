<headline>SOCCER-MCCOIST SETS SCORING RECORD WITH DOUBLE STRIKE.</headline>
<dateline>GLASGOW 1996-12-07</dateline>

<p>Ally McCoist became the Scottish league's record goalscorer with a double strike in five second-half minutes as Glasgow Rangers beat Hibernian 4-3 on Saturday.</p>
<p>McCoist first put Rangers level after 70 minutes when he just beat goalkeeper Jim Leighton to a cross from Dane Brian Laudrup and headed home to equal Gordon Wallace's post-World War Two mark of 264 strikes.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, England midfielder Paul Gascoigne drove in an inviting cross and McCoist thrust out a boot to put Rangers ahead and claim the record of 265 for himself.</p>
<p>It was his 243rd goal for Rangers, with his other 22 coming during his spell at St Johnstone.</p>
<p>McCoist has now scored 16 times this season, and his two goals against the Edinburgh side could have a major impact on the premier division title race.</p>
<p>With Celtic losing 2-1 at Motherwell, Rangers are now eight points clear and on course for a record-equalling ninth successive title.</p>
<p>Yet before McCoist's intervention, Hibernian had threatened to spring a major upset, taking the lead through Keith Wright after 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Rangers equalised in the 34th minute thanks to Ian Ferguson but Hibs restored their advantage six minutes later through Darren Jackson.</p>
<p>However, McCoist's double blow and a fourth goal after 82 minutes by Laudrup effectively swung the game back to Rangers.</p>
<p>Celtic, who trailed 1-0, equalised through substitute Chris Hay with seven minutes left, only for Motherwell to snatch victory when Ian Ross slid the ball home with only seconds remaining.</p>
