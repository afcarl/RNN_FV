David Campese marked his final appearance in a Wallaby jersey by adding one last try to his vast collection as Australia thrashed the Barbarians 39-12 in their end-of-tour showpiece at Twickenham on Saturday.

Campese, now retired from test rugby after 101 caps and a world record 64 international tries, did his best to illuminate a one-sided encounter and was rewarded with one of his side's five tries in the 48th minute.

The result guaranteed Australia a 100 percent record at the end of their 12-match European tour, but the day was all about Campese's farewell to big-time rugby.

The 34-year-old winger was given a standing ovation by a 65,000 crowd as he jogged around the field at the end ahead of his team mates, a fitting tribute to one of the sport's greatest entertainers.

"Today was a great game to finish with. Everyone enjoyed it and I think that's what rugby's all about," commented Campese afterwards.

"Scoring a try doesn't really matter. What I've done over the years is great, but there are other great players out there. If you can be a part of it and throw a good pass that's just as good as scoring a try."

The Barbarians fielded 14 internationals but were out of the game by halftime as Australia served up some tasty rugby before taking their foot off the gas in the final quarter.

Daring flip passes, strong running and excellent support ensured the Barbarians defence was constantly stretched, with Campese obviously keen to leave the 65,000 crowd with something typical to remember him by.

Not all his tricks and feints worked and his try was scarcely a classic, a scampering effort from five metres out after he unexpectedly popped up at fly-half to take replacement hooker Michael Foley's pass.

With a brace of tries from full-back Matthew Burke, who finished with 24 points and a tour aggregate of 136, and other scores from Joe Roff and captain Tim Horan, a record thrashing looked likely until the Barbarians finally responded with second-half tries from Welshmen Alan Bateman and Scott Quinnell.

The invitation side could claim to have been handicapped by the early loss of England full-back Tim Stimpson, who suffered light concussion in a collision with Campese forcing Springbok fly-half Joel Stransky into unfamiliar action at full-back.

The end of the road for Campese, though, overshadowed mere statistics. "A light has gone out in rugby today," said Welsh winger Nigel Walker. "He's a rugby magician and the game is poorer now he's retired."
