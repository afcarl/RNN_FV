SOCCER-MIDDLESBROUGH CAN DAMAGE YOUR CAREER, BRANCO SAYS.

LONDON 1996-12-07

Playing for Middlesbrough can damage an international footballer's career, Brazilian Branco warned his compatriots Emerson and Juninho on Saturday.

Branco, who left the unfashionable English club in October with eight months of his contract still to run, said: "It is a mistake to sign for a small club in English football.

"All the big stars at Middlesbrough came from big and successful clubs but they have joined a team that simply is not good enough. That can damage their careers."

Branco's comments, published in the Express newspaper, were sure to inflame a controversy already raging at the struggling premier league club over Emerson, who has returned to Brazil with his homesick wife.

Branco, a member of Brazil's 1994 World Cup winning side, said of Middlesbrough, who also have Italian Fabrizio Ravanelli: "Spending lots of money cannot always buy you a good team. "The club has invested in some top-quality players, they have a good chairman with lots of money and a wonderful manager in Bryan Robson...but the players around them struggle too much and they used to panic against good teams."

Midfielder Emerson, who signed at the start of the season from Portugal's Porto in a four million pound ($6.7 million) deal , has gone absent without leave three times this season and has already been fined six weeks' salary.

Middlesbrough have told him they will not allow him to break his contract, which runs until 2000.
