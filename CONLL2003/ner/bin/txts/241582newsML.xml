<p>Playing for Middlesbrough can damage an international footballer's career, Brazilian Branco warned his compatriots Emerson and Juninho on Saturday.</p>
<p>Branco, who left the unfashionable English club in October with eight months of his contract still to run, said: &quot;It is a mistake to sign for a small club in English football.</p>
<p>&quot;All the big stars at Middlesbrough came from big and successful clubs but they have joined a team that simply is not good enough. That can damage their careers.&quot;</p>
<p>Branco's comments, published in the Express newspaper, were sure to inflame a controversy already raging at the struggling premier league club over Emerson, who has returned to Brazil with his homesick wife.</p>
<p>Branco, a member of Brazil's 1994 World Cup winning side, said of Middlesbrough, who also have Italian Fabrizio Ravanelli: &quot;Spending lots of money cannot always buy you a good team. &quot;The club has invested in some top-quality players, they have a good chairman with lots of money and a wonderful manager in Bryan Robson...but the players around them struggle too much and they used to panic against good teams.&quot;</p>
<p>Midfielder Emerson, who signed at the start of the season from Portugal's Porto in a four million pound ($6.7 million) deal , has gone absent without leave three times this season and has already been fined six weeks' salary.</p>
<p>Middlesbrough have told him they will not allow him to break his contract, which runs until 2000.</p>
