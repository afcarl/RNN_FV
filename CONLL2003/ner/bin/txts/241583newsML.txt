Mark McNulty opened up a four-shot lead over the rest of the field, although he failed to repeat his fireworks of the previous day during the third round of the Zimbabwe Open on Saturday.

The 43-year-old Zimbabwean, looking for the second Open title in his home country, hard fired a blistering 61 during the second round at the Chapman Golf Club on Friday.

But he had problems on Saturday with a varying wind as he carded a four-under-par 68 for a 54-hole total of 201 -- 15 under for the tournament.

"It was tricky out there today as the wind was swirling. Also, with the trees shading the greens, it was sometimes difficult to judge distance on approach shots," McNulty said.

"But I said to myself at the beginning of the day, if I could break 70, that would be a good round after my 61 yesterday. I played pretty well overall and made two good up-and-down saves on the back nine at 12 and at 13."

Overnight leader Des Terblanche began disastrously with four bogeys in his first seven holes and he finally posted a one-over-par 73 for second place on 205.

Defending champion Nick Price of Zimbabwe, while still struggling with his putter, returned a 70 to be one shot further back on 206.

Three players, South Africans Justin Hobday (71) and Clinton Whitelaw (67) and Zimbabwean Mark Cayeux (69), share fourth spot on 207.

McNulty, one shot off the lead overnight, moved to 12-under for the tournament after a birdie three at the 400-yard second.

With Terblanche dropping shots at the second, third and fourth, McNulty then advanced to 13-under with another birdie at the par-five fifth after rifling his approach to 12 feet and narrowly missing the eagle putt.

But McNulty then dropped shots at the seventh and eighth after finding the bunker and three-putting at both to turn in level-par 36.

He rediscovered his form with a homeward loop of 32 and resisted the sporadic challenges made by Hobday, Cayeux and Terblanche who had all approached to within one-shot of the lead early on the back nine.
