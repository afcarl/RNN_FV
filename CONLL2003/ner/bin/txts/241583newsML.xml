<p>Mark McNulty opened up a four-shot lead over the rest of the field, although he failed to repeat his fireworks of the previous day during the third round of the Zimbabwe Open on Saturday.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old Zimbabwean, looking for the second Open title in his home country, hard fired a blistering 61 during the second round at the Chapman Golf Club on Friday.</p>
<p>But he had problems on Saturday with a varying wind as he carded a four-under-par 68 for a 54-hole total of 201 -- 15 under for the tournament.</p>
<p>&quot;It was tricky out there today as the wind was swirling. Also, with the trees shading the greens, it was sometimes difficult to judge distance on approach shots,&quot; McNulty said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I said to myself at the beginning of the day, if I could break 70, that would be a good round after my 61 yesterday. I played pretty well overall and made two good up-and-down saves on the back nine at 12 and at 13.&quot;</p>
<p>Overnight leader Des Terblanche began disastrously with four bogeys in his first seven holes and he finally posted a one-over-par 73 for second place on 205.</p>
<p>Defending champion Nick Price of Zimbabwe, while still struggling with his putter, returned a 70 to be one shot further back on 206.</p>
<p>Three players, South Africans Justin Hobday (71) and Clinton Whitelaw (67) and Zimbabwean Mark Cayeux (69), share fourth spot on 207.</p>
<p>McNulty, one shot off the lead overnight, moved to 12-under for the tournament after a birdie three at the 400-yard second.</p>
<p>With Terblanche dropping shots at the second, third and fourth, McNulty then advanced to 13-under with another birdie at the par-five fifth after rifling his approach to 12 feet and narrowly missing the eagle putt.</p>
<p>But McNulty then dropped shots at the seventh and eighth after finding the bunker and three-putting at both to turn in level-par 36.</p>
<p>He rediscovered his form with a homeward loop of 32 and resisted the sporadic challenges made by Hobday, Cayeux and Terblanche who had all approached to within one-shot of the lead early on the back nine.</p>
