<p>President Nelson Mandela on Saturday urged the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to validate the five ring Olympic symbol by awarding the Games to Africa and specifically to Cape Town in 2004.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the capacity to organise an event of this nature,&quot; Mandela told reporters after talks with the IOC evaluation comission which is on a four-day visit to Cape Town.</p>
<p>He said that while the commission was in Cape Town to make a technical assessment of the city's formal bid to host the Games, it was important for them to note that the South African bid had the support of the entire continent.</p>
<p>&quot;We as South Africans are confident that we have done everything in our power to put us in a good position to win the bid,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Holding up a set of Olympic rings symbolising the five continents given to him by commission chairman Thomas Bach, Mandela said:</p>
<p>&quot;We also made the point that it would be the first time that the Olympic Games take place on the continent of Africa and therefore these five rings, which until today have remained largely academic because there has never been an Olympic Games in Africa, would then be fulfilled.&quot;</p>
<p>Bach told a news conference that the symbolism of an African venue would not influence the report of his commission which will prepare for a decision in March to shortlist four or five cities.</p>
<p>&quot;Our task is not to deal with that. That's a political question,&quot; he said, adding that this consideration could influence the IOC's 106-member selection college when it makes the final decision on September 5 next year.</p>
<p>Bach said the commission had to compare vastly different bids and had to look eight years into the future basing its analysis on facts, not speculation.</p>
<p>He said the commission would not be influenced by the lack of facilitites at present, adding: &quot;The best athletes deserve the best facilities. We are looking for state of the art in 2004, not state of the art today.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the assessors would meet local opponents of the bid before they leave on Tuesday.</p>
<p>About 20 opponents protested outside Cape Town airport when the IOC team arrived on Friday and on Saturday placed an advertisement in a city newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;Cape Town, wake up to the Olympics risks,&quot; the group said, listing high crime, poor transport, rocketing unemployement and collapsing health services as priorities to be addressed.</p>
