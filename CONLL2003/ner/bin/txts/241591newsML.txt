South Korea and hosts the United Arab Emirates moved within sight of Asian Cup quarter-final berths after contrasting victories in group A matches on Saturday.

South Korea beat Indonesia 4-2 while the UAE staged a remarkable second half comeback to beat Kuwait 3-2 after trailing 2-0 at halftime.

With one game each to play, South Korea lead the group on goal difference from the UAE with four points. Kuwait and Indonesia have a point apiece.

The winners and runners-up of the three groups plus the two best third-placed teams qualify for the knockout stage.

South Korea looked worthy of the tag of one of Asias top sides for the first 55 minutes against Indonesia. They scored three times in the opening quarter of an hour and added a fourth after the break to lead 4-0.

But they then relaxed, conceding two goals from rare counter-attacks.

Kim Do Hoon and Hwang Sun Hong gave the Koreans a flying start with goals in the fifth and seventh minutes. Hwang scored his second eight minutes later.

The Koreans dominated for the rest of the half but scorned five clear-cut chances.

A fourth goal, scored by Ko Jeong Woon 10 minutes into the second half, hinted at a rout but the Indonesians refused to let their heads drop.

Ronny Wabia scored direct from a corner kick in the 58th minute and then seven minutes later Widodo Putra, who scored a spectacular goal against Kuwait on Wednesday, was again on target with a low shot.

The UAE, booed off at halftime after conceding goals to Jassem Al Huwaidi in the ninth and 44th minutes, were a different side in the second half.

They were level within 10 minutes of the restart thanks to headed goals by Hassan Ahmed and Adnan Al Talyani. Kuwait's misery was complete 10 minutes from time when midfielder Bakhit Saad ran on to a pass from substitute Zuhair Bakhait to score the winner.
