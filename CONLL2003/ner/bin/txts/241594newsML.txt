SOCCER-UAE COME BACK FROM 2-0 DOWN TO BEAT KUWAIT.

ABU DHABI 1996-12-07

The United Arab Emirates came from 2-0 down at halftime to beat Kuwait 3-2 in the Asian Cup on Saturday.

Jassem Al Huwaidi silenced the all-male home crowd of 15,000 by giving Kuwait the lead in the ninth minute after being put through by Bashar Abdulaziz's header.

The UAE players were booed off at halftime, Huwaidi having scored his second goal in the 44th minute. He tapped the ball in after Hani Al-Saqer's header from a corner had hit the post and rebounded to him.

But the boos turned to cheers in the 53rd minute when Hassan Ahmed rose well above his marker to head home a cross by Adel Hussain.

Two minutes later the UAE were level, Adnan Al Talyani heading in a corner from the right by Mohamed Mohamed.

Kuwait's misery was complete 10 minutes from time when midfielder Bakhit Saad ran on to a delightful pass from substitute Zuhair Bakhait to hammer home a left-foot shot from 10 metres.

The win puts the UAE in a commanding position to qualify for the quarter- finals.

Group favourites South Korea were playing Indonesia in the day's second group A match.
