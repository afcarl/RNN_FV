SOCCER-ASIA'S SHAH RAPS HAVELANGE FOR WORLD CUP COMMENT.

ABU DHABI 1996-12-07

The president of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) criticised FIFA president Joao Havelange on Saturday for saying that problems were facing Japan and South Korea in co-hosting the 2002 World Cup.

"Dr Havelange's comments are disappointing as far as the AFC is concerned," Sultan Ahmad Shah said. "It must be reiterated that the decision to allow Japan and Korea to co-host the 2002 World Cup was made by the FIFA Executive Committee. Therefore it cannot be a political decision."

Havelange said on Friday that co-hosting would cause headaches and had been a political decision.

Shah, in a press release in Abu Dhabi where he is attending the Asian Cup finals, said that instead of making negative statements Havelange should work closely with the AFC and the co-hosting nations to overcome any problems.

"Certainly there are problems in organising such a mammoth event. But as I see it, both FIFA and the AFC have the capacity to overcome any problem which may arise," Shah said.

"This is the stand of the AFC and we are willing to sit down with FIFA and iron out the issues troubling Dr Havelange."
