<p>Turkey's soccer federation on Saturday protested at Fenerbahce chairman Ali Sen's decision to send club and national team goalkeeper Rustu Recber for a meniscus operation that will rule him out of a World Cup qualifier.</p>
<p>Sen has said there was no question of changing Recber's operation from December 12 and that Fenerbahce were prepared to face fines or relegation to the second division if necessary.</p>
<p>He criticised national coach Mustafa Denizli for picking Recber for the December 14 World Cup qualifier against Wales.</p>
<p>&quot;They just want to punish Fenerbahce,&quot; Sen told Turkish newspapers. &quot;But we will not be fooled by them.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who mess with Fenerbahce will one day find they have Fenerbahce's supporters to face,&quot; Sen said. &quot;Those who do this thing against Fenerbahce today will tomorrow be responsible for incidents in Turkey that should not happen.&quot;</p>
<p>Sen has been known to make fiery speeches that stir up the team's 25 million fanatical supporters nationwide. He often speaks of standing up against the &quot;enemies&quot; of the club.</p>
<p>The soccer federation said it might take legal action against Sen.</p>
<p>&quot;We are sad to observe Ali Sen's irresponsible statements inviting the public to chaos, anarchy and violence,&quot; the federation said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;It is impossible to remain silent and be tolerant in the face of such words and actions that could harm the nation's sport and sportsmen. Whatever is necessary within the law will be done as regards this issue,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Denizli said he expected Recber at a national team training camp in Istanbul on Sunday to prepare for the European group seven match against Wales.</p>
