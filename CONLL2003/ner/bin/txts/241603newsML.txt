NEW YORK 1996-12-06

Former National Football League Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who guided the NFL through a period of meteoric growth in popularity and prosperity, died on Friday. He was 70 years old.

Rozelle, who had been treated for brain cancer in recent years, died at his California home.

During nearly three decades as commissioner, Rozelle created the Super Bowl and Monday Night Football, forged a merger with the rival American Football League and instituted a revolutionary plan for television revenue sharing that helped turn the league into a model sports empire.

Under Rozelle's innovative leadership, the NFL grew from 12 to 28 teams before his surprise retirement in 1989, when he was succeeded by current commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
