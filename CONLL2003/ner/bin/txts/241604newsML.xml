<p>Vancouver Canucks star right wing Pavel Bure was suspended for one game by the National Hockey League and fined $1,000 Friday for his hit on Buffalo Sabres defenceman Garry Galley on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bure received a double-minor penalty for high-sticking with 2:22 left in the first period of Wednesday's 7-6 overtime win by Vancouver after colliding with Galley in Buffalo zone. Galley suffered a concussion and did not return to the game.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Bure left his feet to deliver a forearm blow to Mr Galley as he was about to be checked legally by his opponent,&quot; said NHL discipline chief Brian Burke in handing out the suspension.</p>
<p>&quot;Although it is clear from the videotape that Mr Bure's actions were a reaction to the impending hit and there was no intent to injure his opponent, there can be no excuse for this type of conduct,&quot; Burke said.</p>
<p>Bure, who is struggling with only nine goals and 12 assists in 26 games, will miss Saturday's home game against Ottawa.</p>
