<title>SPAIN: SOCCER-REAL'S BALKAN STRIKE FORCE SINKS BARCELONA.</title>
<headline>SOCCER-REAL'S BALKAN STRIKE FORCE SINKS BARCELONA.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1996-12-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Real Madrid's Balkan strike force of Predrag Mijatovic and Davor Suker scored either side of halftime on Saturday to give their side a 2-0 win over Barcelona in the Spanish league.</p>
<p>Real now have 38 points after 16 games, four ahead of their arch-rivals. Deportivo Coruna, who play Valencia on Sunday, are a further point back on 33.</p>
<p>Real had the best of the clash despite 20 minutes of heavy Barcelona pressure in which they were twice saved by the woodwork and once by a unexpected miss by Brazilian striker Ronaldo.</p>
<p>&quot;Tactically we played a perfect match,&quot; said Real coach Fabio Capello.</p>
<p>The game opened with chances at both ends as Real's Raul Gonzalez lobbed wide after being put through by Mijatovic with goalleeper Vitor Baia stranded.</p>
<p>Moments later Barcelona's Miguel Angel Nadal rose unmarked at a corner only to see his header cleared off the line by Victor Sanchez.</p>
<p>Sanchez, a 20-year-old who has quietly found himself a place in the Real line-up, played a superb game and was again on hand to save the day after Clarence Seedorf nearly scored an own goal from a corner.</p>
<p>Real's first came after 24 minutes when Roberto Carlos looped in a free-kick and Croatian international Suker appeared on the far side to squeeze home the ball after an apparent mix-up in the Barcelona defendce.</p>
<p>&quot;I've always scored goals against Barcelona, and I hope the trend continues,&quot; said the former Sevilla striker.</p>
<p>Real went further ahead three minutes after the break when Seedorf put through Predrag Mijatovic, and the Montenegrin made mo mistake.</p>
<p>But Real were forced back on their heels and Barcelona came close to equalising on the hour when Laurent Blanc headed wide after slipping his marker at a free-kick from Gheorghe Popescu.</p>
<p>A minute later Barcelona Miguel Angel Nadal hit the bar from another set-piece, and Ronaldo was unable to knock in an apparently easy chance.</p>
<p>Barcelona coach Bobby Robson, who brought on striker Juan Pizzi and midfielder Ivan de la Pena in an effort to save the game, said afterwards that he thought the rebound had caught Ronaldo by surprise.</p>
<p>Midway through the second half Real again had the woodwork to thank after Luis Enrique Martinez hit the post with a spectacular overhead kick.</p>
<p>The miss was particularly hard luck for Martinez, who was consistently whistled by his former fans in the Santiago Bernabeu stadium.</p>
<p>&quot;You shouldn't think we've won the league,&quot; said Real president Lorenzo Sanz. But with only one game more to be played this year, Sanz's team are at least assured of spending the Christmas and New Year break ahead of their arch-rivals.</p>
