<p>Jack Charlton's relationship with the people of Ireland was cemented on Saturday when the Englishman was officially declared one of their own.</p>
<p>Charlton, 61, and his wife, Peggy, became citizens of Ireland when they formally received Irish passports from deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring who said the honour had been made in recognition of Charlton's achievements as the national soccer manager .</p>
<p>&quot;The years I spent as manager of the Republic of Ireland were the best years of my life. It all culminated in the fact that I now have lots of great, great friends in Ireland. That is why this is so emotional a night for me,&quot; Charlton said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the joy that we all had over the period, that I shared with people that I grew to love, that I treasure most,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Charlton managed Ireland for 93 matches, during which time they lost only 17 times in almost 10 years until he resigned in December 1995.</p>
<p>He guided Ireland to two successive World Cup finals tournaments and to the 1988 European championship finals in Germany, after the Irish beat a well-fancied England team 1-0 in their group qualifier.</p>
<p>The lanky former Leeds United defender did not make his England debut until the age of 30 but eventually won 35 caps and was a key member of the 1966 World Cup winning team with his younger brother, Bobby.</p>
