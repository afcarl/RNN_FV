SOCCER-MONACO HELD TO GOALLESS DRAW BY GUINGAMP.

PARIS 1996-12-07

Monaco failed to take full advantage of the shock defeat by arch rivals Paris St Germain by Nancy 24 hours earlier when they were held to a goalless draw at home by Guingamp on Saturday.

A win would have allowed in-form Monaco to seize a two-point lead over PSG.

But Monaco, who had won their last four matches, were unable to break down a solid Guingamp defence and had to be content with taking over at the top of the table on goal difference.

Bastia moved into third spot with a 1-0 win over bottom-of-the-table Nice while Bordeaux were beaten 2-1 by champions Auxerre.
