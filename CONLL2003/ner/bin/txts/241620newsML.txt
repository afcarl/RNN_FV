South Africa, spurred by a first half try from hooker James Dalton, defeated France 13-12 on Saturday to clinch the series 2-0.

The Springboks, who have played a record four successive tests without team changes, won the first clash with France 22-12 in Bordeaux last weekend.

Fly-half Henry Honiball converted Dalton's try and put over two penalties to complete the scoring for the Springboks, who have now won four of their five tests on tour after two victories in Argentina. They play Wales in Cardiff next weekend.

Centre Richard Dourthe converted four penalties for France, who were 10-3 down at halftime, three in the second half as the home side edged tantalisingly close to a series saving win.

After matching penalties by Dourthe for France, then Honiball in the opening 10 minutes, South Africa had one try disallowed for a forward pass in the 20th minute, then scored through Dalton six minutes later on the same wing.

A concerted attack by the Springboks swung from the far right across the field, Joost van der Westhuizen feeding the ball out quickly and leaving the French defence outnumbered.

But lock Mark Andrews chose to bypass the centres and flung a long high pass out to wing Jacques Olivier, who with two defenders both going for him fed the ball back inside to the unmarked Dalton who ran in for the try.

Earlier, Hennie Le Roux ran in for a try but was judged to have taken a forward pass from fellow centre Japie Mulder.

At that stage the Springboks were in control and forcing France into numerous misakes, both in their handling and kicking during open play, when the French usually managed merely to give possession back to the World Cup holders.

France had a try disallowed for a knock-on by Dourthe just before the interval in their best attack of the first half as the home side tried to play to their strengths in open play. But the visitors were impregnable in defence.

Flyhalf Christophe Lamaison, who won his second cap, said: "They come forward very quickly and have a superb first line of defence. We got rid of some of our imperfections but still lost."

Springboks' assistant coach Nick Mallet said: "When the Springboks are on the field they tackle. You can't beat us with up-and-unders, the only chance is to play wide."

Honiball put South Africa 13-3 up six minutes into the second half but then the Springbok scoring dried up when it looked like some sustained attacking might produce a second try.

France came back into the game, winning penalties some considerable distance from the posts but which Dourthe's fine kicking converted into points.

"We played two tests against France without conceding a try, that's good for the team, it shows its character," South African coach Andre Markgraaf said.

"Those were the longest 40 minutes (second half) of my life. But when they came back to 12-13 we feared a penalty not a try. We had above all to be very disciplined. Our defene was too strong for them."

French captain Abdelatif Benazzi said: "Again we dropped several balls and this was fatal. We've had a difficult spell, coming up against the world champions.

"The (Five Nations) tournament is coming up and we must relearn our basics.
