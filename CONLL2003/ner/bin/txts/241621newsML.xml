<title>SPAIN: SOCCER-HAVELANGE THE GREAT SURVIVOR IN WORLD SPORTS POLITICS.</title>
<headline>SOCCER-HAVELANGE THE GREAT SURVIVOR IN WORLD SPORTS POLITICS.</headline>

<p>Jaoa Havalange, the first non-European to head soccer's world governing body FIFA, was one of the great survivors in the often murky world of sports politics.</p>
<p>The 80-year-old Brazilian, who announced on Saturday he would retire at the end of the World Cup finals in France in 1998, took over the International Football Federation amid third world unrest from England's from Sir Stanley Rous in 1974.</p>
<p>Under his stewardship soccer confirmed its place as the world's number one sport, new tournaments for all age groups and regions were instituted while 32 teams will compete in France, double the number who competed in Germany 22 years ago.</p>
<p>Havalange's election as FIFA president on June 11, 1974, ended Europe's 70-year-old monopoly of one of the powerful positions in international sport and followed a three-year globe-trotting campaign.</p>
<p>A member of Brazil's swimming team at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Havalange has maintained a strict physical fitness regime to the present day.</p>
<p>He neither smokes nor drinks alcohol, sleeps just five or six hours a night and both walks and swims every day.</p>
<p>Enduring physical fitness undoubtedly helped Havalange cope with a protracted career in sports administration after an amateur playing career with the Rio de Janeiro club Fluminense in the 1930s.</p>
<p>In 1956 he was head of the Brazilian delegation at the Melbourne Olympics and in the following year he was elected vice-president of Brazil's Football Association (CBF).</p>
<p>A year later he took over as president from Sylvio Pacheco and eventually left the CBF in 1975 shortly after assuming the FIFA presidency.</p>
<p>While he was in command Brazil enjoyed a golden period, winning the World Cup in 1958, 1962 and again in 1970.</p>
<p>Havelange's earliest challenge came in 1976 when South Africa were expelled from FIFA for their apartheid policy.</p>
<p>He presided over FIFA as the game spread throughout the third world and two years ago was re-elected president for a sixth four-year term amid public enthusiasm and private criticism for his dictatorial style.</p>
<p>This year Havelange suffered an unprecedented reverse when he was forced to announce that FIFAwould award the 2002 World Cup jointly to South Korea and Japan.</p>
<p>Only days earlier Havelange had said co-hosting World Cup finals was against FIFA statutes and added that two nations would never be accepted as co-hosts while he was president.</p>
<p>The climbdown was a clear boost for his only declared rival for the FIFA throne, Sweden's Lennart Johansson who is president of the European governing body UEFA . Johansson, a FIFA vice-president, successfully persuaded the majority of the executive that co-hosting the finals was the only way to avoid damaging political repercussions.</p>
<p>Havalange said on Saturday he had started to think seriously about retiring after a banquet held by FIFA in May to mark his 80th birthday. He also said a speech from Johansson urging unity in world football had led him to &quot;meditate&quot; about his position.</p>
<p>&quot;I will leave with a clear conscience that in the 24 years I would have served FIFA and world football my administration with the help of my supporters has change the sport throughout the world,&quot; he said.</p>
