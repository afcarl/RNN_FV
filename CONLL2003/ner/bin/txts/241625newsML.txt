RUGBY UNION-DALTON TRY GIVES SOUTH AFRICA NARROW WIN.

PARIS 1996-12-07

A first half  try by hooker James Dalton spurred South Africa to a 13-12 victory over France in the second test at Parc des Princes on Saturday and a 2-0 series win.

Fly-half Henry Honiball converted the try and put over two penalties to complete the scoring for the Springboks, who have now won all four of their tests on tour after two victories in Argentina. They play Wales in Cardiff next weekend in their last international.

Centre Richard Dourthe converted four penalties for France, who were 10-3 down at halftime, three in the second half as the home side edged tantalisingly close to a series saving win.

After matching penalties, first by Dourthe for France then Honiball for the Springboks in the opening 10 minutes, South Africa had a try disallowed for a forward pass in the 20th minute, then scored through Dalton six minutes later.

A concerted attack by the Springboks swung from the far right across the field, Joost van der Westhuizen feeding the ball out quickly and leaving the French defence outnumbered.

Lock Mark Andrews chose to bypass the centres and flung a long high pass out to wing Jacques Olivier who, with two defenders going for him, fed the ball back inside to the unmarked Dalton who ran in for the try.

Honiball put South Africa 13-3 up six minutes into the second half but then the Springbok scoring dried up.

France, beaten 22-12 in the first test in Bordeaux last weekend, came back into the game, winning penalties that Dourthe's fine kicking converted into points.
