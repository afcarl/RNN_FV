<p>FIFA did an about-face on Saturday and agreed that Bosnia could play the rest of their home World Cup qualifiers in their capital city of Sarajevo.</p>
<p>Until now, FIFA had refused Bosnia's request to stage matches in Sarajevo and they were forced to play their first home World Cup match against Croatia in Bologna, Italy in November.</p>
<p>But after successfully staging a friendly against Italy in Sarajevo last month and with UN troops undertaking a new 18-month mandate in the war-torn country, FIFA have taken a softer line.</p>
<p>General secretary Sepp Blatter said: &quot;The request was supported by the executive committee who felt this would give a psychological boost to football in Bosnia and to the country in general.&quot;</p>
<p>He also said that FIFA wanted soccer to remain part of the Olympic Games -- an issue which was discussed by UEFA earlier this week.</p>
<p>Although UEFA president Lennart Johansson said soccer could be dropped from the Olympics, Blatter said it would remain in the Games although FIFA had been extremely upset with the way organisers of this summer's Olympics in Atlanta handled the sport.</p>
<p>Not one match was staged in the host city and no matches were shown live on American televison.</p>
<p>&quot;For us it was not the Atlanta Olympics it was the U.S. Olympics,&quot; said Blatter who added that FIFA would insist to the organisers of the 2000 games in Sydney that the opening match and the final must take place in the Olympic stadium.</p>
<p>&quot;Soccer attracted 1.4 million spectators to the Olympics and raised 100 million dollars in revenue and we should be treated with proper respect,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In other matters Blatter said Eritrea would most likely become the next full member of FIFA after being accepted as a provisional member of the African Confederation while delegations were to visit Mongolia, Bhutan and Palestine to assess their bids for FIFA membership. It ruled that Kazakhstan who, had applied to join UEFA, must stay within the Asian Confederation.</p>
<p>FIFA president Joao Havelange said that from next year FIFA would donate one million dollars a year to each of its national federations as part of their guaranteed income as FIFA members and that the six member confederations would each receive 10 million dollars over a four year period to help with soccer's development in their regions.</p>
<p>On another financial matter Fifa ordered the Greek F.A. to pay 100,000 dollars compensation to the Canadian Soccer Association for failing to participate in a tournament in Canada earlier this year.</p>
