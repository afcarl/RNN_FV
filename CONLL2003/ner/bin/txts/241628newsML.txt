MUNICH, Germany 1996-12-07

Tim Henman's lucrative run at the Grand Slam Cup ended on Saturday when he came across the killer instinct of three-times Wimbledon champion Boris Becker in the semifinals.

Henman, who doubled his earnings for the year by reaching the last four, put up an admirable display in front of 11,000 German fans. But it was not enough to stop an in-form Becker from winning 7-6 6-3 6-1.

The Australian Open champion is playing some of the best tennis of his career at the moment and pushed world number one Pete Sampras to five dramatic sets before losing the ATP world championship final last month.

Although 22-year-old Henman at times matched the German in terms of powerful serving and crisp volleying, Becker, seven years his senior, used every bit of his experience to excel on the big points.

The Munich arena was covered in banners supporting Becker and the crowd roared their approval of every one of the German's winners.

A lone British flag honoured the presence of Henman. "Go, Tim, Go," shouted the message painted on it.

For a while in the first and second sets, Henman looked capable of producing one of the best results in British tennis for decades. But he faded at the end.

The first set was dominated by powerful serving and few rallies.

Henman, who hit some blistering returns on his forehand and backhand, put Becker under pressure on his own serve and had a break point in the fourth game which the German managed to save.

But Becker lifted his game in the crucial tiebreak. He had a bit of luck with the first point when his service return hit the top of the net and just bounced over in court.

But from then on he served and volleyed with more pace and precision and clinched the tiebreak 7-2 with a volley at the net.

Becker took the initiative in the second game of the second set with a break when Henman double-faulted. But Henman showed composure, breaking back in the next game with a superb forehand lob.

The match saw more and more rallies from the baseline, Becker's experience showing with his ability to get out of trouble when it really mattered.

Henman had a break point in the fifth game but was unable to take advantage of it. Becker made the crucial break to lead 5-3 with a blistering backhand return across the court. He then served out for the set.

Henman wilted after that. His service was broken in the first and third games of the third set and Becker clinched the match after one hour 50 minutes when Henman double-faulted.

However, the British number one took his leave of the tournament with $431,250 in his pocket after the most lucrative week of his life. More importantly, he has gained invaluable experience for the future.
