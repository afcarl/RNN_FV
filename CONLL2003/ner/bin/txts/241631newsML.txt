SKIING-MYLLYLA CLAIMS FIRST WORLD CUP WIN.

DAVOS, Switzerland 1996-12-07

Finland's Mika Myllyla posted his first career nordic World Cup win on Saturday with a victory in the 10-km classic style cross-country race.

A bronze and silver medallist at the Lillehammer Olympics and a bronze medallist at the 1995 world championships, the 27-year-old Finn stepped to the top of the podium for the first time after racing round the sun-drenched layout in 26 minutes two seconds.

Norway's Erling Jevne was a distant second, more than 13 seconds adrift with 26:15.4. Italy's Fulvio Valbusa was third in 26:16.9.

Bjoern Daehlie of Norway, who won the season-opening freestyle cross-country race two weeks ago and in the process eclipsed Swede Gunde Svan's record of 30 World Cup wins, finished a disappointing 18th, one minute behind the winner.

"This victory gives me great confidence ahead of the world championships," said Myllyla, who had previously reached the podium eight times in World Cup competition. "Bjoern Daehlie is still the king but now I and others know the king can be beaten."

In the women's 10-km classic, Italy's Stefania Belmondo collected her 10th career World Cup win when she crossed first, ahead of a pack of four Russians, in a time of 29:06.0

Elena Vaelbe, who registered her 38th World Cup win two weeks ago, settled for second in 29:12.8 followed by compatriot Nina Gavriliuk in third with 29:21.0.
