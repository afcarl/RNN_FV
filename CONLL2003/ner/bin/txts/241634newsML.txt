SOCCER-DUTCH SPORT7 CHANNEL FAILS AFTER JUST FOUR MONTHS.

AMSTERDAM 1996-12-07

New Dutch TV channel Sport7 said on Saturday it would cease broadcasting at midnight on Sunday after shareholders decided late on Friday to cut off financial aid.

"Sport7's risk-bearing shareholders...have decided they will no longer make good the losses," the channel said in a statement.

It said that as a result of the decision it would seek court protection from creditors, which it expected to be granted next week.

Sport7, the Netherlands' first sports-only channel, is owned jointly by PTT Nederland, ING, Philips Electronics and Dutch television producers John de Mol and Joop van den Ende, publisher De Telegraaf , Dutch soccer association KNVB and cable firm Telekabel.

In less than four months of operations Sport7's losses have mounted to at least 100 million guilders ($57.7 million), undermined by poor viewing figures and protracted wrangling over broadcasting rights for Dutch major league soccer matches.

The Dutch soccer association KNVB sold exclusive rights for Dutch league soccer to Sport7 in a seven-year deal worth 140 million guilders ($80.7 million) a year.

But KNVB's entitlement to do so was later challenged in the courts by Feyenoord Rotterdam, currently riding high in the Dutch first division.

The club initially lost its case but won an interim judgement on appeal. A final decision is still pending.
