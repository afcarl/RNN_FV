<p>New Dutch TV channel Sport7 said on Saturday it would cease broadcasting at midnight on Sunday after shareholders decided late on Friday to cut off financial aid.</p>
<p>&quot;Sport7's risk-bearing shareholders...have decided they will no longer make good the losses,&quot; the channel said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said that as a result of the decision it would seek court protection from creditors, which it expected to be granted next week.</p>
<p>Sport7, the Netherlands' first sports-only channel, is owned jointly by PTT Nederland, ING, Philips Electronics and Dutch television producers John de Mol and Joop van den Ende, publisher De Telegraaf , Dutch soccer association KNVB and cable firm Telekabel.</p>
<p>In less than four months of operations Sport7's losses have mounted to at least 100 million guilders ($57.7 million), undermined by poor viewing figures and protracted wrangling over broadcasting rights for Dutch major league soccer matches.</p>
<p>The Dutch soccer association KNVB sold exclusive rights for Dutch league soccer to Sport7 in a seven-year deal worth 140 million guilders ($80.7 million) a year.</p>
<p>But KNVB's entitlement to do so was later challenged in the courts by Feyenoord Rotterdam, currently riding high in the Dutch first division.</p>
<p>The club initially lost its case but won an interim judgement on appeal. A final decision is still pending.</p>
