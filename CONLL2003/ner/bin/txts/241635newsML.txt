SOCCER-HAVELANGE ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT AS FIFA PRESIDENT.

BARCELONA 1996-12-07

Joao Havelange, who has been president of FIFA since 1974, announced on Saturday he would retire from the position at the end of the 1998 World Cup finals in France.

Havelange, 80, said: "I told the Executive Committee of my decision this morning. It is my own decision and it is final. The most important thing is not to know when to arrive but when to leave."  

There has been speculation for some time about when the octogenarian Brazilian, who succeeded Britain's Sir Stanley Rous 22 years ago, would stand down. But his timing was still a surprise.

Havelange added: "I will have a clear conscious when I leave after 24 years that I have served FIFA and world soccer well with those who have supported me.

"We have changed football throughout the world. Football is the most important sport in the world in terms of employment, advertising and for bringing joy to young people. We have all worked for this, which is why we are where we are today."

Among those being tipped as a possible successor is Franz Beckenbauer of Germany, who said last month he was planning to step down as the president of Bayern Munich in the summer of 1998.
