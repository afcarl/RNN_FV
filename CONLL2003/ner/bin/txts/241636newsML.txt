SQUASH-NICOL FIGHTS BACK TO WIN MAHINDRA INTERNATIONAL.

BOMBAY 1996-12-07

Scotsman Peter Nicol, described by his opponent Rodney Eyles as having "a heart as big as big as the cup he won", successfully defended his Mahindra International title on Saturday.

Nicol beat world number two Eyles in a one hour 40 minute final of wildly fluctuating fortunes 13-15 15-10 7-15 17-15 15-13.

Nicol looked a beaten man when he went 10-4 down in the fourth game. But he clawed his way back to lead 14-12 .

Eyles saved three game points before losing the game 17-15 when his forehand volley was adjudged to have passed too close to him and he conceded a penalty stroke.

Eyles was forced to do the scrambling in the deciding game, hauling himself back into contention from 5-1 and then 13-10 down.

But the Australian top seed missed a relatively easy backhand drop shot and then failed to clear the path in the backhand court to give Nicol the match.

World number three Nicol said: "I don't seem to be able to put a foot wrong in Bombay and I hope to come back next year to win the title a third time."
