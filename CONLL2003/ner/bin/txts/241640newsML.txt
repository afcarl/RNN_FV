CRICKET-SOHAIL RECALLED BY PAKISTAN FOR WORLD SERIES.

LAHORE, Pakistan 1996-12-07

Pakistan recalled opener Aamir Sohail in a 15-strong squad announced on Saturday for this month's world series one-day competition in Australia.

Sohail, who was dropped from the current test and one-day series against New Zealand, regained his berth after cracking a century in a domestic championship match.

The experienced 30-year-old left-hander has appeared in 112 limited-overs games, scoring 3,672 runs and has taken 67 wickets with his left-arm spin.

The tournament involves Australia, Pakistan and West Indies.

The Pakistan selectors have banked on a battery of pace bowlers for hard and bouncy Australian wickets.

They have included 20-year-old Muhammad Zahid, who claimed 11 wickets on his recent test debut against New Zealand at Rawalpindi.

He is the fourth fast bowler in the side along with captain Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and teenager Shahid Nazir.

The other newcomer is middle-order batsman Muhammad Wasim, who scored a fine 109 on his debut in the Lahore test against New Zealand, and opener Zahoor Elahi.

Both are making their first trip abroad for the national squad, which leaves for Australia next Tuesday.

Squad: Wasim Akram (captain), Saeed Anwar (vice-captain), Aamir Sohail, Ijaz Ahmad, Salim Malik, Inzamamul Haq, Moin Khan, Mushtaq Ahmad, Saqlain Mushtaq, Waqar Younis, Shahid Nazir, Muhammad Zahid, Shahid Afridi, Zahoor Elahi, Muhammad Wasim.
