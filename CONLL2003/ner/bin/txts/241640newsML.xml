<p>Pakistan recalled opener Aamir Sohail in a 15-strong squad announced on Saturday for this month's world series one-day competition in Australia.</p>
<p>Sohail, who was dropped from the current test and one-day series against New Zealand, regained his berth after cracking a century in a domestic championship match.</p>
<p>The experienced 30-year-old left-hander has appeared in 112 limited-overs games, scoring 3,672 runs and has taken 67 wickets with his left-arm spin.</p>
<p>The tournament involves Australia, Pakistan and West Indies.</p>
<p>The Pakistan selectors have banked on a battery of pace bowlers for hard and bouncy Australian wickets.</p>
<p>They have included 20-year-old Muhammad Zahid, who claimed 11 wickets on his recent test debut against New Zealand at Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>He is the fourth fast bowler in the side along with captain Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and teenager Shahid Nazir.</p>
<p>The other newcomer is middle-order batsman Muhammad Wasim, who scored a fine 109 on his debut in the Lahore test against New Zealand, and opener Zahoor Elahi.</p>
<p>Both are making their first trip abroad for the national squad, which leaves for Australia next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Squad: Wasim Akram (captain), Saeed Anwar (vice-captain), Aamir Sohail, Ijaz Ahmad, Salim Malik, Inzamamul Haq, Moin Khan, Mushtaq Ahmad, Saqlain Mushtaq, Waqar Younis, Shahid Nazir, Muhammad Zahid, Shahid Afridi, Zahoor Elahi, Muhammad Wasim.</p>
