S.AFRICA'S SANLAM SEES 2.3 PCT GDP GROWTH FOR 97.

CAPE TOWN 1996-12-08

South African life assurer Sanlam forecast gross domestic product growth of 2.3 percent for 1997 on Sunday and predicted increased unemployment.

Sanlam's chief economist Johan Louw said in the company's economic survey for December:

"We foresee total real gross domestic expenditure on goods and services increasing by only around 1.1 percent in 1997. Fortunately the volume of exports is expected to rise slightly faster than that of imports and this could raise the growth rate of real GDP for 1997 to about 2.3 percent."

South Africa recorded GDP growth of 3.3 percent in 1995 and Sanlam estimates growth of 3.0 percent for 1996.

President Nelson Mandela said on Friday his government hoped its macro-economic framework for Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) would ensure growth of six percent by the end of the century and the creation of around 400,000 new jobs a year.

But Louw said only a limited increase in jobs was expected for 1997.

"Since the start of the upturn (mid-1993) almost one million potential workers have been unable to find employment in the formal sector of the economy and have therefore been added to the already disturbing number of unemployed," he said.

"Unfortunately, a growth rate (of 2.3 percent) cannot absorb the new entrants to the job market, which means that unemployment will increase further."

Sanlam forecast growth in private consumer spending of 1.7 percent for 1997 and a reversal in real inventories.
