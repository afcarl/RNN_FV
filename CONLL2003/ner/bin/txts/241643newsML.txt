POLISH GDANSK SHIPYARD WORKERS SCALE DOWN PROTEST.

GDANSK, Poland 1996-12-07

Workers from Polish bankrupt Gdansk shipyard on Saturday limited a two-week sit-in at the provincial governor's office after the government hinted it might guarantee loans to the yard, a trade union official said.

Jerzy Borowczak, the head of the shipyard's Solidarity union, told Reuters about 100 out of 150 protesters agreed to leave the local government offices after overnight talks with the union's chairman Marian Krzaklewski.

He said members of the protest committee would remain in the building until Wednesday, December 11 -- a deadline by which the protesters want the government to announce its decision on loan guarantees.

"If nothing happens by Wednesday we will go to Krzaklewski and then we will decide to start a nationwide protest," Borowczak said.

Earlier on Friday seven workers suspended a 10-day hunger strike after Treasury Minister Miroslaw Pietrewicz said the government could guarantee loans needed to build five vessels for a German shipowner if a bank agreed to finance the project.

The union says a loan of $120-150 million, would keep part of the 5,000-strong workforce busy while the government and the yard continue to seek an investor to save the whole business burdened with over 415 million zlotys ($148 million) in debts.

The shipyard's administrator, managing the company under bankruptcy laws since August, is in talks with the local Bank Gdanski on arranging a syndicated loan.

But the bank has made clear that it could go only to a separate company created from part of the yard's assets and not to the whole firm.

The government, led by an ex-communist party, has accussed the yard's previous managements of negotiating bad contracts which led to large debts surpassing the value of the company.

It has also said protests in the shipyard -- where 16 years ago Lech Walesa set up Solidarity, the then Soviet bloc's first free trade union -- deter potential creditors and investors.

Unionists and opposition say that the government, which has helped other state-owned enterprises, is refusing aid for the shipyard because it is a nest of political opposition.

Solidarity is leading an electoral bloc which hopes to defeat the co-ruling ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) in next year's ballot.
