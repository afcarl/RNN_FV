<p>A new Hungarian government health report says the country's male population is smoking and drinking itself to death.</p>
<p>Thirty-five percent of Hungary's seven million adults are smokers while one in five males is an alcololic, a Central Statistical Office (KSH) survey published in Saturday's daily Nepszabadsag reports.</p>
<p>The survey was based on 5,476 interviews with Hungarians between the age of 15 and 64.</p>
<p>&quot;The survey found a dramatic deterioration in the health of adult males in the 1990s and the mortality rate among middle-aged Hungarian men is now one of the highest in the world,&quot; Peter Jozan, the head of the team carrying out the survey, was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>According to the KSH report, the high mortality rate is more the result of unhealthy life styles and environmental factors than the quality of healthcare services.</p>
<p>Only a small proportion of Hungarians regularly eat fresh fruit and vegetables, 30.3percent are overweight and 13.1pc are seriously overweight, the KSH report said.</p>
<p>According to World Bank fogures, average life expectancy for Hungarian males ages 35 to 69 is the lowest in Europe. Half the men in that age group are not expected to live to age 70. Some 21 percent will succumb to lung cancer linked to smoking.</p>
<p>Rates of cardiovascular disease, fueled in part by Hungary's cholesterol-rich diet, are among the highest in Europe. Deaths from cirrhosis are soaring while alcoholism, hypertension and depression all contribute to the high mortality rates.</p>
