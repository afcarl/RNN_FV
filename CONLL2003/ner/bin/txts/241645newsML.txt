Major's survival to May UK election date in doubt.

British Prime Minister John Major's chances of surviving in power until a May deadline for national elections was thrown into doubt on Saturday as his Conservative government faced an era of minority rule beset by threats of further defections.

Ending what political commentators saw as the worst week for Major since he became leader in 1990, the government saw its one-seat majority in parliament effectively wiped out when Conservative MP Sir John Gorst withdrew his support on Friday in protest over a hospital closure in his constituency.

Another Conservative, Hugh Dykes, warned he was ready to follow suit over the same issue and a third, Terry Dicks, threatened to quit unless Major ruled out Britain joining a single European currency.

"Time and hope are running out for John Major's administration," said the influential Financial Times in an editorial.

"It no longer seems quite so certain that Mr Major will be able to go to the country at the time of his choosing next May," the newspaper added.

All eyes will be on Major on Sunday when he gives a crucial interview on BBC television in a bid to calm nerves and make yet another appeal for unity.

Major, whose Conservatives are some 20 points behind the opposition Labour Party in opinion polls, has said repeatedly that he wants to stay in office until the May deadline for elections.

But with the issue of European integration still causing bitter rifts within the Conservatives he faces an uphill battle.

A by-election on Thursday in a Labour stronghold of northern England is expected to seal the government's status as a minority administration for the first time since 1979.

Cabinet ministers went on national radio on Saturday to defend again Major's stance on a European single currency -- the issue that sparked reports this week that finance minister Kenneth Clarke had threatened to resign.

Conservative "Eurosceptics" want Major to rule out British entry into a single currency during the next parliament, a move opposed by Clarke who wants Britain to retain its "wait-and-see" policy.

The Labour Party was holding fire over if and when it would call a vote of confidence that would precipiate the election. But leader Tony Blair said the government was "disintegrating before our eyes".

"This shambles cannot go on any longer and the sooner we get the chance to put them out of their misery the better," Blair said.

The last Labour government clung on for two years before 1979 by doing deals with minor parties after losing its overall majority. Major's Conservatives are now at the mercy of the nine-strong Ulster Unionist MP's from Northern Ireland, who usually tend to vote with the government.

But the Ulster Unionists, who staunchly support British rule of Northern Ireland, have warned ministers they cannot take that support for granted and will judge each issue on its merits.
