Britain's Major bids to shore up crumbling support.

Prime Minister John Major will make a personal bid on Sunday to stop support haemorrhaging from a government clinging precariously to office after a week of bitter internal feuding over Europe.

As the Labour opposition prepared to harry a government technically left in a minority by a disaffected ruling party member of parliament who withdrew his support on Friday, Major decided to go public to quell mounting Conservative panic.

In an extensive live television interview, Major is due to set out his policy on Europe in a desperate bid to unite a party many commentators believe to be fractured beyond repair.

Party sources said he was expected to insist there would be no change on his "wait-and-see" policy on British entry into a European single currency before the election -- which must be held by May but which Major may be forced to call early.

But to keep on board "Eurosceptics" in his ruling Conservatives opposed to European integration, he is also expected to stress Britain will not join a single currency if other countries "fudge" the economic criteria for entry.

The interview is being billed as the most important of his career, a "make-or-break" bid to quell civil war in his party.

But Major, who newspapers said hammered out his careful choice of words after a cabinet showdown last week between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and right-wingers led by Home Secretary Michael Howard, is walking a tightrope.

Too hard on Europe, and he will provoke Clarke, who wants to keep Britain's single currency options open. Clarke's departure would spook financial markets and fatally wound the government.

Too soft, and Eurosceptics will bay for his political blood.

Labour's deputy leader, John Prescott, on Saturday gave Major little chance of success. "It seems they are in total disarray, melting down, and the Government has lost authority.

"They are a party that can't be led and a leader that can't lead. That is quite fatal for any government," he said.

The latest poll issued even before the turmoil over Europe put Labour 37 points ahead of Major's ruling party.

And the next seven days bristles with traps for Major after what newspapers called his worst week since the 1992 election when he held on to win a fourth successive Conservative term.

On Wednesday, the government starts a two-day debate on Europe, with Eurosceptics in full cry.

On Thursday, a by-election in the Labour stronghold of Barnsley in northern England is set to seal the government's status as a minority administration -- the first since 1979.

And on the ill-omened Friday the 13th, Major will start a two-day European summit in Dublin where other leaders will push for more European integration leaving him isolated and exposed.

Labour has so far held fire over whether and when it would call a vote of confidence that would precipitate the election.

The last Labour government clung on for two years by doing deals with minor parties after losing its overall majority.

But in March 1979, Labour lost a vote of confidence, precipitating 17 years of Conservative rule.

After Conservative Sir John Gorst's withdrawal of support on Friday in protest at a hospital closure, Major technically has 322 MPs to the 323 mustered by all opposition parties.

But the Barnsley vote will add one more to opposition ranks.

Major can survive full House of Commons votes with the help of the nine-strong Ulster Unionist MP's from Northern Ireland.

But in key parliamentary committees where legislation is reviewed, the lack of a majority will allow Labour to exploit the situation to the maximum to hasten Major's fall.
