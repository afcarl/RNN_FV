<p>Prime Minister John Major will make a personal bid on Sunday to stop support haemorrhaging from a government clinging precariously to office after a week of bitter internal feuding over Europe.</p>
<p>As the Labour opposition prepared to harry a government technically left in a minority by a disaffected ruling party member of parliament who withdrew his support on Friday, Major decided to go public to quell mounting Conservative panic.</p>
<p>In an extensive live television interview, Major is due to set out his policy on Europe in a desperate bid to unite a party many commentators believe to be fractured beyond repair.</p>
<p>Party sources said he was expected to insist there would be no change on his &quot;wait-and-see&quot; policy on British entry into a European single currency before the election -- which must be held by May but which Major may be forced to call early.</p>
<p>But to keep on board &quot;Eurosceptics&quot; in his ruling Conservatives opposed to European integration, he is also expected to stress Britain will not join a single currency if other countries &quot;fudge&quot; the economic criteria for entry.</p>
<p>The interview is being billed as the most important of his career, a &quot;make-or-break&quot; bid to quell civil war in his party.</p>
<p>But Major, who newspapers said hammered out his careful choice of words after a cabinet showdown last week between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and right-wingers led by Home Secretary Michael Howard, is walking a tightrope.</p>
<p>Too hard on Europe, and he will provoke Clarke, who wants to keep Britain's single currency options open. Clarke's departure would spook financial markets and fatally wound the government.</p>
<p>Too soft, and Eurosceptics will bay for his political blood.</p>
<p>Labour's deputy leader, John Prescott, on Saturday gave Major little chance of success. &quot;It seems they are in total disarray, melting down, and the Government has lost authority.</p>
<p>&quot;They are a party that can't be led and a leader that can't lead. That is quite fatal for any government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The latest poll issued even before the turmoil over Europe put Labour 37 points ahead of Major's ruling party.</p>
<p>And the next seven days bristles with traps for Major after what newspapers called his worst week since the 1992 election when he held on to win a fourth successive Conservative term.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the government starts a two-day debate on Europe, with Eurosceptics in full cry.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a by-election in the Labour stronghold of Barnsley in northern England is set to seal the government's status as a minority administration -- the first since 1979.</p>
<p>And on the ill-omened Friday the 13th, Major will start a two-day European summit in Dublin where other leaders will push for more European integration leaving him isolated and exposed.</p>
<p>Labour has so far held fire over whether and when it would call a vote of confidence that would precipitate the election.</p>
<p>The last Labour government clung on for two years by doing deals with minor parties after losing its overall majority.</p>
<p>But in March 1979, Labour lost a vote of confidence, precipitating 17 years of Conservative rule.</p>
<p>After Conservative Sir John Gorst's withdrawal of support on Friday in protest at a hospital closure, Major technically has 322 MPs to the 323 mustered by all opposition parties.</p>
<p>But the Barnsley vote will add one more to opposition ranks.</p>
<p>Major can survive full House of Commons votes with the help of the nine-strong Ulster Unionist MP's from Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>But in key parliamentary committees where legislation is reviewed, the lack of a majority will allow Labour to exploit the situation to the maximum to hasten Major's fall.</p>
