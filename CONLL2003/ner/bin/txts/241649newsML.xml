<p>A British by-election this week in a former mining community that is an opposition Labour stronghold looks certain to seal the fate of the Conservative government as a minority administration.</p>
<p>Thursday's poll in northern Barnsley East, ravaged by unemployment following the closure of some 20 coal mines since 1980, is set to boost Labour ranks and weaken the chances of Prime Minister John Major holding on until a May deadline for national elections.</p>
<p>&quot;There could not be a better place for it to happen,&quot; said Labour candidate Jeff Ennis, the son of a former miner.</p>
<p>&quot;I can think of no constituency in the country that has suffered more at the hands of the Conservative government. Our traditional industry has been wiped out for political dogma,&quot; Ennis said.</p>
<p>Ennis is set to win the seat for Labour by a huge margin just a week after Major effectively lost his one-seat majority in parliament when Conservative MP Sir John Gorst withdrew his support over a London hospital closure.</p>
<p>Although not technically a resignation, Gorst's decision meant that he could not be officially counted as voting with the Conservatives.</p>
<p>A Labour victory in Barnsley East on Thursday will put the government firmly in minority administration territory. Political pundits have few doubts about the outcome.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, some 20,000 people in the Barnsley area worked in the mining industry. But after a bitter, year-long pit strike in 1984, all 20 coal mines were gradually closed as the Conservative government first ran down and then privatised the industry.</p>
<p>Unemployment in Barnsley East, a collection of former pit villages, is now twice the national average at some 12 percent.</p>
<p>Ennis fears voters may prove apathetic about a by-election in such a safe seat. &quot;It's vital for people to vote, and play their part in getting rid of the Tories,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Conservative candidate Jane Ellison dismisses any idea that electors see the by-election as an epoch-making event. &quot;Voters don't see this in grandiose political terms,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Barnsley election should answer whether there is room for a Socialist party in Britain now that Labour leader Tony Blair has moved his party to the centre ground of politics.</p>
<p>Former mining union official Ken Capstick is standing for the newly-formed Socialist Labour Party, founded by Arthur Scargill who led the 1984 miners' strike.</p>
<p>Capstick and his supporters, who are calling for six coal mines to be reopened, are convinced he can come a respectable second when results are announced on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not a fringe party. We are fighting to win,&quot; said national executive member Bob Crow.</p>
<p>The Conservatives face another testing by-election in South Wirral near Liverpool within the next three months. Labour, more than 20 points ahead in national opinion polls, could well gain the seat.</p>
