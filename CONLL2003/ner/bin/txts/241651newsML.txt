LONDON 1996-12-07

British customs officers said on Saturday they had found a suitcase containing 20 kg (44 lb) of heroin on a coach carrying day-trippers from the Netherlands to London.

A spokesman said the driver, tour organiser and courier had been arrested following the early morning seizure at the port of Dover.

"Some 20 kilos of heroin with a street value of more than two million pounds ($3.3 million) were found in a suitcase lying on the seat in the coach," the spokesman said.

The party of day-trippers had crossed to Dover on a night ferry and were bound for London where they were to visit a mosque, the spokesman said. None of the passengers, who were mostly of Asian origin, were implicated in the seizure. ($1=.6082 Pound)
