BELFAST 1996-12-07

A 35-year-old woman appeared in court on Saturday charged with possessing explosives and ammunition at her Belfast home.

Blonde-haired Henrietta Mackin, a cook, was ordered to be held in jail until a further hearing later this month. She was arrested after police searched her house on Thursday.

Mackin was charged with possessing 300 rounds of ammunition, three explosive devices containing Semtex and 34 incendiary devices. She was not required to enter a plea.

Security forces said the bombs may have been intended for use in a pre-Christmas bombing campaign by Irish guerrillas battling to oust Britain from Northern Ireland.
