Britain faces minority government.

Britain on Saturday faced its first minority government for 17 years after a Conservative lawmaker withdrew his support for the ruling party in parliament.

Prime Minister John Major's wafer-thin majority was effectively wiped out when right-winger Sir John Gorst launched his protest over a hospital closure in his London constituency.

Friday's bombshell ended a grim week for Major when splits were revealed all the way to the top of the government over Britain's role in the European Union.

Major, who has to call a general election by next May, faces another rough ride next week with a two-day parliamentary debate that will offer a perfect opportunity for right-wing lawmakers to fuel their mutiny over Europe.

Terry Dicks, one of the so-called "Eurosceptics" who wants Major to rule out British entry into a single European currency and abandon his "wait and see" policy, launched a savage attack on the prime minister.

Threatening to quit the ruling party, Dicks said: "I don't want to be on a ship like the Titanic where the helmsman can see the ice ahead and simply says, 'Let's wait and see what happens'."

The opposition Labour Party, which has a huge lead in opinion polls, was quick to turn the knife.

Labour leader Tony Blair told the Independent newspaper: "We have reached a decisive moment. They (the Conservatives) are not capable of being led; they are not capable of governing with any coherence, any leadership, any direction."

Labour should have further cause to celebrate as it is expected to win a by-election next Thursday in one of its strongholds.

But history favours Major holding on.

Labour became a minority government in 1976 and survived 42 defeats and two confidence motions before falling in 1979.

The Conservatives have been able to enjoy a nine-seat cushion in the 651-seat House of Commons because the Ulster Unionists from Northern Ireland tend to side with the government.

But the Ulster Unionists have warned ministers they cannot take that support for granted and said they would judge each issue on its merits.

The 21-seat majority that Major won against all the odds in the 1992 general election has been whittled away by defections and by-election defeats.

His administration has also been buffeted by sex and financial scandals. Mutinies over Europe have abounded.

Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine defiantly forecast that the Conservatives would win a 60-seat majority at the next election.
