<title>UK: Britain faces minority government.</title>

<p>Britain on Saturday faced its first minority government for 17 years after a Conservative lawmaker withdrew his support for the ruling party in parliament.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major's wafer-thin majority was effectively wiped out when right-winger Sir John Gorst launched his protest over a hospital closure in his London constituency.</p>
<p>Friday's bombshell ended a grim week for Major when splits were revealed all the way to the top of the government over Britain's role in the European Union.</p>
<p>Major, who has to call a general election by next May, faces another rough ride next week with a two-day parliamentary debate that will offer a perfect opportunity for right-wing lawmakers to fuel their mutiny over Europe.</p>
<p>Terry Dicks, one of the so-called &quot;Eurosceptics&quot; who wants Major to rule out British entry into a single European currency and abandon his &quot;wait and see&quot; policy, launched a savage attack on the prime minister.</p>
<p>Threatening to quit the ruling party, Dicks said: &quot;I don't want to be on a ship like the Titanic where the helmsman can see the ice ahead and simply says, 'Let's wait and see what happens'.&quot;</p>
<p>The opposition Labour Party, which has a huge lead in opinion polls, was quick to turn the knife.</p>
<p>Labour leader Tony Blair told the Independent newspaper: &quot;We have reached a decisive moment. They (the Conservatives) are not capable of being led; they are not capable of governing with any coherence, any leadership, any direction.&quot;</p>
<p>Labour should have further cause to celebrate as it is expected to win a by-election next Thursday in one of its strongholds.</p>
<p>But history favours Major holding on.</p>
<p>Labour became a minority government in 1976 and survived 42 defeats and two confidence motions before falling in 1979.</p>
<p>The Conservatives have been able to enjoy a nine-seat cushion in the 651-seat House of Commons because the Ulster Unionists from Northern Ireland tend to side with the government.</p>
<p>But the Ulster Unionists have warned ministers they cannot take that support for granted and said they would judge each issue on its merits.</p>
<p>The 21-seat majority that Major won against all the odds in the 1992 general election has been whittled away by defections and by-election defeats.</p>
<p>His administration has also been buffeted by sex and financial scandals. Mutinies over Europe have abounded.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine defiantly forecast that the Conservatives would win a 60-seat majority at the next election.</p>
