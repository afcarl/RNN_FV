LONDON - British shares suffered their biggest one-day loss in four years as world markets tumbled following surprise anti-inflation comments from U.S. Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, yet shares had rallied from their earlier sharp decline by the close, as Wall Street steadied and a benign U.S. jobs report eased the market's interest rate fears. The FTSE 100 index closed 88.2 points lower at 3,963.0, falling 95.0 from last Friday.

FRANKFURT - The German DAX ended the bourse session down 4.05 percent with dollar down and following comments by Bundesbanker Jochimsen and U.S. Fed chief Alan Greenspan.

PARIS - French shares closed a dramatic trading day 2.26 percent down in a huge volume of 11.2 billion francs after a mass sell-off on remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.

"This depends on Wall Street", one trader noted.
