Cricket-Spinners' wicket holds key in third test.

KANPUR, India 1996-12-07

India's spinners are expected to prosper on a turning wicket in the deciding third and final test of their series against South Africa which begins on Sunday.

But South Africa's morale is high after a rousing victory in the second test at Calcutta which levelled the series after their opening defeat in Ahmedabad.

South African manager Bob Woolmer, born in this northern Indian industrial city where his father worked for a British manufacturing company, said the wicket would aid spinners.

"The wicket looks hard at the top but seems soft inside, indicating that it will turn a lot," he told reporters. "We expected this and are prepared for the challenge."

Indian skipper Sachin Tendulkar endorsed Woolmer's views.

"The wicket will surely offer help to the spinners from day one," he said. "The wicket here has always been slow and made stroke-making difficult even in one-dayers."

Woolmer, however, said the seam bowlers would also get assistance from the pitch as the ball would grip the surface.

"The sparingly rolled pitch will afford low bounce," he said. "The ball will spin but not as viciously as in the first test at Ahmedabad."

South African skipper Hansie Cronje said the track was better than the one at Ahmedabad, where India won by 64 runs. South Africa levelled the series with a 329-run triumph at Calcutta's Eden Garden.

Tendulkar, playing down concern over his own form, named a 12 which left out medium-pacer David Johnson and leg-spinner Narendra Hirwani.
