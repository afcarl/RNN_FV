<headline>Cricket-Spinners' wicket holds key in third test.</headline>

<p>India's spinners are expected to prosper on a turning wicket in the deciding third and final test of their series against South Africa which begins on Sunday.</p>
<p>But South Africa's morale is high after a rousing victory in the second test at Calcutta which levelled the series after their opening defeat in Ahmedabad.</p>
<p>South African manager Bob Woolmer, born in this northern Indian industrial city where his father worked for a British manufacturing company, said the wicket would aid spinners.</p>
<p>&quot;The wicket looks hard at the top but seems soft inside, indicating that it will turn a lot,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;We expected this and are prepared for the challenge.&quot;</p>
<p>Indian skipper Sachin Tendulkar endorsed Woolmer's views.</p>
<p>&quot;The wicket will surely offer help to the spinners from day one,&quot; he said. &quot;The wicket here has always been slow and made stroke-making difficult even in one-dayers.&quot;</p>
<p>Woolmer, however, said the seam bowlers would also get assistance from the pitch as the ball would grip the surface.</p>
<p>&quot;The sparingly rolled pitch will afford low bounce,&quot; he said. &quot;The ball will spin but not as viciously as in the first test at Ahmedabad.&quot;</p>
<p>South African skipper Hansie Cronje said the track was better than the one at Ahmedabad, where India won by 64 runs. South Africa levelled the series with a 329-run triumph at Calcutta's Eden Garden.</p>
<p>Tendulkar, playing down concern over his own form, named a 12 which left out medium-pacer David Johnson and leg-spinner Narendra Hirwani.</p>

<p>India (from): Sachin Tendulkar (captain), Wokeri Raman, Nayan Mongia, Saurav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Mohammed Azharuddin, Vangipurappu Laxman, Sunil Joshi, Aashish Kapoor, Javagal Srinath, Anil Kumble, Venkatesh Prasad.</p>
