High turnout as Ghana's Rawlings seeks final term.

Ghana's populist leader Jerry Rawlings, who has been called everything from a dictator to a messiah, sought a final four-year term as elected president on Saturday against a rejuvenated opposition.

Electoral officials said turnout was heavy as Ghanaians queued patiently to vote in presidential and parliamentary elections in the gold-rich West African nation that was a pioneer in post-colonial African nationalist politics.

Rawlings, an air force flight-lieutenant who twice seized power in the former British colony and once executed three former heads of state, is still only 49 and has undoubted charisma.

"I am going to concentrate on protecting the tree of freedom that was sown in the revolt of '79," he told reporters after voting at a polling station by the 17th century Danish-built Christiansborg Castle, seat and symbol of presidential power.

Rawlings, who first seized power in 1979, predicted he would win comfortably and handed his sweat-soaked handkerchief to a woman well-wisher -- a gesture characteristic of the man who scuffled with his vice-president at a cabinet meeting and concedes to being "not much of a diplomat".

A key question was whether Rawlings's crowd-pulling populism would bring him victory in the face of widespread unemployment and high inflation -- 39.2 percent in August.

His rivals -- seasoned politician and businessman John Kufuor, 57, of the New Patriotic Party and outsider Edward Mahama of the People's National Convention -- set out to tap this vein of smouldering discontent.

Both predicted victory. "I'm sure to give Rawlings a first-round knockout," Kufuor said in Kumasi, where he voted.

Rawlings's National Democratic Congress faces strong competition for parliament's 200 seats from an alliance of Kufuor's party and the People's Convention Party, who learned the lesson of going into 1992 multi-party elections in disarray.

Security presence in the capital was discreet following a highly charged campaign marred by sporadic violence. Troops deployed ahead of polling in Kumasi, capital of the mighty pre-colonial Ashanti empire and a Kufuor stronghold.

One person died in unrest in Kumasi during campaigning.

Polling under the hot African sun was both colourful and orderly. Organisational glitches caused occasional delays.

Counting began at 5 p.m. (1700 GMT), when most polling stations closed. Early returns are expected on Sunday, full results on Monday.

"It feels like there's going to be a change," farmer Lawrence Boi, 72 and a veteran of all five of Ghana's elections since independence in 1957, said while waiting to vote.

"I don't want any change. What I am seeing in Ghana makes me vote for J.J. (Rawlings)," said student Daniel Ofosu, 18.

Rawlings took power in 1979, restored civilian rule but seized power again in 1981. He is a former socialist firebrand who converted to Western-style free-market economics -- winning plaudits from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.

More than nine million of the gold and cocoa producer's 17.5 million people were eligible to vote in Saturday's polls.

About 100 foreign and 4,000 Ghanaians monitored polling. A runoff will be held in 21 days if no one wins outright.

Whoever wins will have his running mate as vice-president. Rawlings chose law professor John Mills, Kufuor chose estranged vice-president Kow Arkaah. Mahama chose a woman, Dedo Mate.
