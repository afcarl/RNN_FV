<p>Ghana's populist leader Jerry Rawlings, who has been called everything from a dictator to a messiah, sought a final four-year term as elected president on Saturday against a rejuvenated opposition.</p>
<p>Electoral officials said turnout was heavy as Ghanaians queued patiently to vote in presidential and parliamentary elections in the gold-rich West African nation that was a pioneer in post-colonial African nationalist politics.</p>
<p>Rawlings, an air force flight-lieutenant who twice seized power in the former British colony and once executed three former heads of state, is still only 49 and has undoubted charisma.</p>
<p>&quot;I am going to concentrate on protecting the tree of freedom that was sown in the revolt of '79,&quot; he told reporters after voting at a polling station by the 17th century Danish-built Christiansborg Castle, seat and symbol of presidential power.</p>
<p>Rawlings, who first seized power in 1979, predicted he would win comfortably and handed his sweat-soaked handkerchief to a woman well-wisher -- a gesture characteristic of the man who scuffled with his vice-president at a cabinet meeting and concedes to being &quot;not much of a diplomat&quot;.</p>
<p>A key question was whether Rawlings's crowd-pulling populism would bring him victory in the face of widespread unemployment and high inflation -- 39.2 percent in August.</p>
<p>His rivals -- seasoned politician and businessman John Kufuor, 57, of the New Patriotic Party and outsider Edward Mahama of the People's National Convention -- set out to tap this vein of smouldering discontent.</p>
<p>Both predicted victory. &quot;I'm sure to give Rawlings a first-round knockout,&quot; Kufuor said in Kumasi, where he voted.</p>
<p>Rawlings's National Democratic Congress faces strong competition for parliament's 200 seats from an alliance of Kufuor's party and the People's Convention Party, who learned the lesson of going into 1992 multi-party elections in disarray.</p>
<p>Security presence in the capital was discreet following a highly charged campaign marred by sporadic violence. Troops deployed ahead of polling in Kumasi, capital of the mighty pre-colonial Ashanti empire and a Kufuor stronghold.</p>
<p>One person died in unrest in Kumasi during campaigning.</p>
<p>Polling under the hot African sun was both colourful and orderly. Organisational glitches caused occasional delays.</p>
<p>Counting began at 5 p.m. (1700 GMT), when most polling stations closed. Early returns are expected on Sunday, full results on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels like there's going to be a change,&quot; farmer Lawrence Boi, 72 and a veteran of all five of Ghana's elections since independence in 1957, said while waiting to vote.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want any change. What I am seeing in Ghana makes me vote for J.J. (Rawlings),&quot; said student Daniel Ofosu, 18.</p>
<p>Rawlings took power in 1979, restored civilian rule but seized power again in 1981. He is a former socialist firebrand who converted to Western-style free-market economics -- winning plaudits from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p>
<p>More than nine million of the gold and cocoa producer's 17.5 million people were eligible to vote in Saturday's polls.</p>
<p>About 100 foreign and 4,000 Ghanaians monitored polling. A runoff will be held in 21 days if no one wins outright.</p>
<p>Whoever wins will have his running mate as vice-president. Rawlings chose law professor John Mills, Kufuor chose estranged vice-president Kow Arkaah. Mahama chose a woman, Dedo Mate.</p>
