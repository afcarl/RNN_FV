Central Africa talks start, mutineers hold fire.

Four African leaders mediated on Saturday to end Central African Republic's third army revolt of the year and an associated spiral of ethnic bloodshed.

Officials and witnesses said mutineers observed a truce as the presidents of Gabon, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mali met embattled President Ange-Felix Patasse, opposition politicians and leaders of the revolt.

The foreign leaders had arrived in Bangui on Friday from a Franco-African summit. But Patasse, kept in power by French troops in May, came under attack from an alliance of opposition parties blaming him for the turmoil.

"Three mutinies is too much. This is very serious and has to be sorted out by Africans as a family," Radio France Internationale quoted Gabonese President Omar Bongo as saying after meeting Patasse.

"The Central African Republic must not become another Rwanda, a Somalia, a Liberia or a Sierra Leone," he said.

Leaders of 11 opposition parties signed a memorandum for the mediators attacking Patasse. "He is no longer in a position to embody national unity," said the memorandum, made available to Reuters.

They accused Patasse of ignoring accords that ended a mutiny in May -- especially disarming foreigners said to have joined the president's armed civilian militia.

Rebel soldiers, who launched their latest mutiny on November 16, say disarming civilians and mercenaries from Chad and Sudan is a prime objective. They halted efforts to disarm militias because of the talks.

The rebels, who on Thursday clashed with loyalist soldiers and French troops protecting Patasse, welcomed the mediation initiated by the Franco-African summit which ended in Burkina Faso on Friday.

Bangui remained tense but calm. Shops and businesses stayed closed.

However, residents said tribal killings continued, pitting southern Yakomas who dominate the rebel ranks against Patasse's northern Bayas. They reported abductions and killings by both sides.

Former interior minister Christophe Grelombe, a Yakoma, and his son were seized on Thursday and murdered.

Former colonial power France has voiced backing for the elected government but says its troops based in the country under defence pacts would not help it combat the mutineers.

"French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities," French President Jacques Chirac told a news conference at the end of the Franco-African summit.

The latest uprising began over pay demands and an attempt by Patasse to redeploy soldiers involved in May's revolt. The year's first revolt was in April.
