<p>Ghanaians voted in large numbers on Saturday with populist leader Jerry Rawlings, who twice came to power through military coups, seeking a final term as elected president against a rejuvenated opposition.</p>
<p>Long queues formed in the capital Accra as Ghanaians turned out in force to vote in presidential and parliamentary elections in the gold-rich West African nation that was a pioneer in post-colonial African nationalist politics.</p>
<p>Rawlings, an air force flight-lieutenant who first seized power in the former British colony in 1979 and executed three former military heads of state, is still only 49 and has undoubted charisma.</p>
<p>&quot;I am going to concentrate on protecting the tree of freedom that was sown in the revolt of '79,&quot; he told reporters after voting at a polling station by the 17th century Danish-built Christiansborg Castle, seat and symbol of presidential power.</p>
<p>Rawlings, who has been labelled everything from a dictator to a messiah, handed his sweat-soaked handkerchief to a woman well-wisher -- a gesture characteristic of the man who scuffled with his vice-president at a cabinet meeting and concedes to being &quot;not much of a diplomat&quot;.</p>
<p>A key question was whether Rawlings's crowd-pulling populism would bring him victory in the face of widespread unemployment and high inflation -- 39.2 percent in August.</p>
<p>His rivals -- John Kufuor, 57, of the New Patriotic Party and outsider Edward Mahama of the People's National Convention -- set out to tap this vein of smouldering discontent.</p>
<p>Rawlings's National Democratic Congress faces strong competition for parliament's 200 seats from an alliance of Kufuor's party and the People's Convention Party, which both learned the lesson of going into 1992 multi-party elections in disarray.</p>
<p>Security presence in the capital was discreet following a highly charged campaign marred by sporadic violence. Troops deployed ahead of polling in Kumasi, capital of the mighty pre-colonial Ashanti empire and a Kufuor stronghold.</p>
<p>Polling under the hot African sun was both colourful and orderly. Organisational glitches caused occasional delays. Early returns were expected on Sunday, full results by Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels like there's going to be a change,&quot; farmer Lawrence Boi, 72 and a veteran of all five of Ghana's elections since independence in 1957, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want any change. What I am seeing in Ghana makes me vote for J.J. (Rawlings),&quot; said student Daniel Ofosu, 18.</p>
<p>Rawlings took power in 1979, restored civilian rule but seized power again in 1981. He is a former socialist firebrand who converted to Western-style free-market economics -- winning plaudits from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p>
<p>Modern Ghana takes its name from an ancient empire lasting from before Jesus Christ to the 12th century. That empire, like its 19th-century Ashanti successor, based its power on gold.</p>
<p>Nationalist leader Kwame Nkrumah, a figurehead among African independence leaders, was prime minister and then president of the new nation until the army deposed him in 1966.</p>
<p>Cocoa brought early wealth but by the 1980s corruption and mismanagement had made Ghana one of Africa's poorest nations.</p>
<p>More than nine million of Ghana's 17.5 million people were eligible to vote in Saturday's polls. At least one person died in political unrest in Kumasi during campaigning.</p>
<p>About 100 foreign and 4,000 Ghanaians monitored polling. A runoff will be held in 21 days if no one wins outright.</p>
<p>Whoever wins will have his running mate as vice-president. Rawlings chose law professor John Mills, Kufuor chose estranged vice-president Kow Arkaah. Mahama chose a woman, Dedo Mate.</p>
