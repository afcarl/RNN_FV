<p>Rebels pressed their offensive in eastern Zaire as aid agencies and Western powers argued on Saturday over the number of Rwandan refugees still missing because of the fighting.</p>
<p>The Zairean rebels said on Friday they would move towards the large town of Bunia on Saturday and their volatile tribal allies, the Mai-Mai, were already moving up from Beni, 140 km (85 miles) to the southwest.</p>
<p>Aid sources said Bunia was still held by the Zairean army, which had received air-borne reinforcements from Kisangani, largest city in the region. The rebels earlier claimed to have taken Bunia last Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Alliance of Democratic Forces for Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) fighters now control much of eastern Zaire after capturing the towns of Uvira, Kamanyola, Bukavu, Goma, Butembo and Beni.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril, Canadian commander of a multinational force to help Rwandan refugees and displaced Zaireans arrived in Rwanda from Nairobi en route to Zaire.</p>
<p>Baril told reporters in Kigali before heading to talks with aid agencies in the Rwandan border town of Gisenyi he would visit rebel-held eastern Zaire on Sunday for more information.</p>
<p>Canadian Defence Minister Doug Young said on Friday 700,000 refugees had returned to Rwanda from Zaire, the highest estimate since rebellion broke out in Zaire in October.</p>
<p>A U.N. official, who declined to be identified, called the estimate &quot;ridiculous&quot; and said &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of people needed help: &quot;There appears to be a push by some powers to maximise the number back to disguise doing nothing for those who remain in Zaire.&quot;</p>
<p>Sadako Ogata, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said in Geneva on Friday 562,000 refugees in eastern Zaire had returned by Wednesday. In addition 60,000 Burundian refugees had returned to Burundi.</p>
<p>Ogata said her agency's figure of 1.2 million refugees originally in Zaire had come from careful survey, but U.S. diplomats have suggested the UNHCR total was exaggerated.</p>
<p>Before Canada's estimate on Friday the highest total for the number returned in November was 656,000 from U.S. military searches for refugees still in Zaire using aerial surveillance.</p>
<p>&quot;Against a UNHCR registered caseload of 1.096 million Rwandan refugees in Zaire before the crisis, basic arithmetic suggests there should be a minimum of 439,500 remaining in Zaire,&quot; the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) said.</p>
<p>Baril said on Friday aerial surveillance has found no more than 165,000 refugees on the move in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;The 'numbers issue' remains one of the hottest political issues in the humanitarian crisis in eastern Zaire,&quot; DHA said.</p>
<p>Rwanda and rebel leader Laurent Kabila said all non-military refugees who wanted to go home had done so while aid agencies openly doubted the impartiality of the foreign surveys.</p>
<p>A French aid agency said on Friday more than 100,000 Rwandan refugees were trekking northwest through Zaire in a huge column. Baril made no mention of such a movement.</p>
<p>The small multinational force based in Uganda has so far been unable to deploy in eastern Zaire because of opposition from both the Kinshasa government and Rwandan-backed rebels.</p>
