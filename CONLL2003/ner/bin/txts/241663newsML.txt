Amnesty slams UN over Rwandan refugee repatriation.

The human rights group Amnesty International has hit out at the U.N. refugee agency, accusing it of condoning the imminent expulsion of half a million Rwandan refugees by Tanzania in contravention of its basic principles.

"The refugees are not just an anonymous mass of half a million people who can be treated in an identical fashion," Amnesty said in a statement on Friday.

"There may be many among them who would be at risk on return...Over half a million people are being expected to return at less than one month's notice, with apparently no provision for those who continue to fear human rights violations in Rwanda to exercise their right to seek asylum," it added.

Tanzania's government and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told Rwandan refugees on Thursday to return home by the end of December.

Amnesty urged Tanzania and the United Nations to reverse its decision which it said amounted to forced repatriation.

There are 542,000 Rwandan refugees in Tanzania. The vast majority are Hutus who fled Rwanda in 1994 after the extremist Hutu government then in power orchestrated genocidal killings of some one million minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus.

Many fear reprisals if they return to Rwanda, now under the control of a Tutsi army, regardless of whether they took part in the genocide.

UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler declined to comment on the Amnesty report. He said 1,118 Rwandan refugees had registered on Friday to return home from Tanzania and might leave on Tuesday.

"Last week we repatriated 600 people from Tanzania to Rwanda which was more than in the whole month of November. We think that after a scheduled food distribution in the camps on Monday registration and repatriation figures will shoot up," he said.

"We hope this will build into a crescendo, a flood of people home," he added.

Amnesty said a joint statement by the Tanzanian government and the United Nations made no mention of options for those who feared human rights violations if they returned to Rwanda.

"By issuing this joint statement, UNHCR is effectively rubber-stamping this decision by Tanzania which contravenes its own basic principles of protection of refugees," Amnesty said.

"Instead it should be publicly protesting at Tanzania's decision."

Tanzania moved to get rid of its unwanted guests, who have destroyed countryside in their search for fuel and food, after more than 500,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees flooded out of Zaire to Rwanda last month to escape civil war around their camps.

Tanzania said it had decided all refugees on its soil could return safely home and the Tanzanian police, and the army if necessary, would be charged with protecting departing refugees.

Aid workers have said that in order to provoke a mass exodus from the camps, authorities will have to separate the innocent refugees from Rwandan Hutu intimidators who are wanted in Rwanda for involvement in the genocide and oppose a return.

UNHCR officials say any refugees who refuse to return from Tanzania probably fear reprisals for their role in the genocide and therefore may ultimately lose their refugee status.

UNHCR officials say they have been assured by the Tanzanian government that force will not be used against "ordinary refugees".

Amnesty said Rwandan jails were crammed with 87,000 prisoners accused of involvement in the genocide.

"Amnesty International is concerned that the international community has been playing down the real level of human rights violations in Rwanda in order to entice the refugees to return," it said.

Amnesty said, however, that so far there had been no large- scale arrests of killings of returnees among the refugees who returned from Zaire last month.

"However in view of the persistent pattern of human rights violations in Rwanda it is still much too early to judge their longer-term safety in the country," the Amnesty statement said.
