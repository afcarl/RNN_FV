<p>Ghanaians voted in large numbers in presidential and parliamentary elections on Saturday, with President Jerry Rawlings facing a stiff opposition challenge in his bid for a final four-year term.</p>
<p>Rawlings, a former air force flight-lieutenant who twice came to power through coups, has charisma but a key question in the election is whether his crowd-pulling abilities can bring him victory despite widespread unemployment and high inflation.</p>
<p>Huge queues formed at polling stations in the West African nation's capital Accra long before they opened at or shortly after 7 a.m. (0700 GMT), following a lively but highly charged campaign marred by sporadic violence.</p>
<p>Security presence in the capital was discreet but troops were deployed ahead of the poll in the central city of Kumasi, heartland of the mighty pre-colonial Ashanti empire and stronghold of main opposition presidential hopeful John Kufuor.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels like there's going to be a change,&quot; farmer Lawrence Boi, 72, told Reuters at a polling station outside the 17th century Danish-built Christiansborg Castle, seat and symbol of presidential power in the gold-rich, former British colony.</p>
<p>Boi, a veteran of all five of Ghana's elections since independence in 1957, was waiting patiently with his 28-year-old son at the end of a long queue in bright morning sunshine.</p>
<p>&quot;This man must go,&quot; an opposition supporter aged 65 said, gesturing at the castle.</p>
<p>Early polling was orderly and followed calls to vote early.</p>
<p>Rawlings, 49, who has dominated the life of Ghana since seizing power in 1979, urged a high turnout in a controversial eve-of-poll nationwide address.</p>
<p>He said the polls held &quot;a very special significance in Ghana's democratic progress&quot; noting that an administration was seeking re-election for the first time.</p>
<p>The opposition, which paid the price of going into 1992 presidential and parliamentary polls in disarray, denounced the timing of Rawlings's broadcast address as unfair.</p>
<p>Rawlings's rivals are Kufuor, 57, of the New Patriotic Party and surgeon Edward Mahama of the People's National Convention.</p>
<p>His National Democratic Congress faces strong competition for parliament's 200 seats from an alliance of Kufuor's party and the People's Convention Party, who have targeted inflation (39.2 percent in August) and unemployment (around 35 percent).</p>
<p>More than nine million of Ghana's 17.5 million people are eligible to vote. At least one person died in political unrest in Kumasi during campaigning. At least 10 people died nearby when a truck careered into an opposition march.</p>
<p>Ghana takes its name from an ancient empire that lasted from before Jesus Christ to the 12th century. Like the Ashanti empire of the late 18th and 19th centuries it based its power on gold.</p>
<p>Nationalist leader Kwame Nkrumah, a figurehead among African independence leaders, was prime minister and then president of the new nation until the army deposed him in 1966.</p>
<p>Rawlings took power in 1979, restored civilian rule but seized power again in 1981. Since then, the one-time socialist firebrand has steered Ghana down the road of Western-style economic liberalisation.</p>
<p>About 100 foreign and 4,000 trained domestic observers monitored the polls, which close at 5 p.m. (1700 GMT). Early returns were expected on Sunday and full results on Monday. A run-off will be held in 21 days if no clear winner emerges.</p>
<p>Whoever wins the presidency will have his running mate as automatic vice-president. Rawlings has law professor John Mills on his ticket. Kufuor has Rawlings's estranged vice-president Kow Arkaah. Outsider Mahamat chose a woman, Dedo Mate.</p>
