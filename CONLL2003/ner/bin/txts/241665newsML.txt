Big turnout in Ghana elections.

ACCRA 1996-12-07

Ghanaians turned out in big numbers on Saturday to vote in presidential and parliamentary elections, with President Jerry Rawlings facing a stiff opposition challenge in his bid for a final four-year term.

Queues formed at polling stations long before they opened at or shortly after 7 a.m. (0700 GMT) following a lively but highly charged campaign marred by sporadic violence.

"It feels like there's going to be a change," farmer Lawrence Boi, 72, told Reuters at a polling station outside the 17th century Danish-built Christiansborg Castle, seat and symbol of presidential power in the former British colony.

Polling followed a controversial eve-of-vote nationwide address by Rawlings, who has dominated the political life of the West African country since first seizing power in 1979.

Urging a high turnout, Rawlings said the polls held "a very special significance in Ghana's democratic progress" noting that an administration was seeking re-election for the first time.

His rivals -- John Kufuor of the New Patriotic Party and surgeon Edward Mahama of the People's National Convention -- denounced the timing of the address as unfair.

Rawlings's ruling National Democratic Congress faces a strong challenge from an alliance formed by Kufuor's party and the People's Convention Party.

Since independence in 1957 Ghanaians have voted only five times. The army first intervened in 1966 when it ousted nationalist president Kwame Nkrumah.

Rawlings, a former air force flight-lieutenant, took power in 1979, restored civilian rule but seized power again in 1981. Since then, the one-time socialist firebrand has steered Ghana down the road of Western-style economic liberalisation.

Polls close at 5 p.m. (1700 GMT). A run-off will be held in 21 days if no clear winner emerges.
