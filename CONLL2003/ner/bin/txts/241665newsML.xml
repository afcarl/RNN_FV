<title>GHANA: Big turnout in Ghana elections.</title>

<p>Ghanaians turned out in big numbers on Saturday to vote in presidential and parliamentary elections, with President Jerry Rawlings facing a stiff opposition challenge in his bid for a final four-year term.</p>
<p>Queues formed at polling stations long before they opened at or shortly after 7 a.m. (0700 GMT) following a lively but highly charged campaign marred by sporadic violence.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels like there's going to be a change,&quot; farmer Lawrence Boi, 72, told Reuters at a polling station outside the 17th century Danish-built Christiansborg Castle, seat and symbol of presidential power in the former British colony.</p>
<p>Polling followed a controversial eve-of-vote nationwide address by Rawlings, who has dominated the political life of the West African country since first seizing power in 1979.</p>
<p>Urging a high turnout, Rawlings said the polls held &quot;a very special significance in Ghana's democratic progress&quot; noting that an administration was seeking re-election for the first time.</p>
<p>His rivals -- John Kufuor of the New Patriotic Party and surgeon Edward Mahama of the People's National Convention -- denounced the timing of the address as unfair.</p>
<p>Rawlings's ruling National Democratic Congress faces a strong challenge from an alliance formed by Kufuor's party and the People's Convention Party.</p>
<p>Since independence in 1957 Ghanaians have voted only five times. The army first intervened in 1966 when it ousted nationalist president Kwame Nkrumah.</p>
<p>Rawlings, a former air force flight-lieutenant, took power in 1979, restored civilian rule but seized power again in 1981. Since then, the one-time socialist firebrand has steered Ghana down the road of Western-style economic liberalisation.</p>
<p>Polls close at 5 p.m. (1700 GMT). A run-off will be held in 21 days if no clear winner emerges.</p>
