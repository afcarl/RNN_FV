High turnout for Ghana poll, rivals upbeat.

Ghanaians voted peacefully and in large numbers in national elections with populist president Jerry Rawlings confident of victory in his bid for a final four-year term of office.

But the rejuvenated opposition, which made a determined pitch for power in Saturday's presidential and parliamentary elections in the West African nation, was optimistic of springing a surprise.

"It looks almost like South Africa in 1994," one foreign observer said, commenting on the high turnout and the orderly enthusiasm of voters in the capital Accra.

Unofficial returns from a handful of polling stations showed Rawlings taking a lead in more populous poorer areas of Accra and his main rival John Kufuor edging ahead in wealthier districts.

But with Kufuor drawing his support from his stronghold in Kumasi, the West African nation's second city and capital of the mighty pre-colonial Ashanti empire, it was too early to say which trend would prove decisive.

Pundits gave little chance to the third contender, surgeon Edward Mahama of the People's National Convention.

Counting was conducted in full view of voters and party representatives. Full results were expected by Monday.

A runoff will be held in 21 days if no one wins outright.

Rawlings, who has been called everything from a dictator to a messiah, said after voting in Accra that he expected to win.

"It is going to be a very gracious, technical knockout and I am going to concentrate on protecting the tree of freedom that was sown in the revolt of '79," he told reporters.

An air force flight-lieutenant who twice seized power in the former British colony and once executed three former heads of state, Rawlings staged his first coup in 1979.

Still only 49, he said that if he won he would invite his rivals "to join in the development of the nation".

Kufuor, 58 on Sunday and a seasoned politician and a businessman, was also confident of victory. "I'm sure to give Rawlings a first-round knockout," Kufuor said in Kumasi, where he voted and where one person died in pre-poll unrest.

Ghana, whose independence leader Kwame Nkrumah was a pioneer in post-colonial African nationalist politics, is rich in gold. It is also a major cocoa producer.

Rawlings took power in 1979, restored civilian rule but seized power again in 1981. He is a former socialist firebrand who converted to Western-style free-market economics -- winning plaudits from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.

His National Democratic Congress faced strong competition for parliament's 200 seats from an alliance of Kufuor's party and the People's Convention Party, who learned the lesson of going into 1992 multi-party elections in disarray.

A key question was whether Rawlings's crowd-pulling populism would bring him victory in the face of widespread unemployment and high inflation which have fuelled popular discontent.

More than nine million of Ghana's 17.5 million people were eligible to vote. Foreign and Ghanaian observers monitored polling.
