Zaire rebels say they poised to attack key town.

BENI, Zaire 1996-12-08

Zairean rebels said they were advancing on a key town in eastern Zaire that the government's battered army had reinforced in an effort to halt its string of defeats.

As a struggle for Bunia appeared imminent, prospects of foreign military intervention to help civilians caught in the war appeared slim. France, chief backer on intervention, said it was now out of the question.

Rebel officers of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) told journalists in the eastern town of Beni on Saturday their forces and those of the Mai Mai militia had reached the outskirts of Bunia, 140 km (85 miles) to the southwest.

A Reuters correspondent saw truckloads of rebel fighters moving towards Bunia. The rebels are backed by the Mai-Mai, a volatile militia group which practises withcraft, and one truck had 60 Mai Mai fighters, mostly children.

In the advance on Bunia and earlier battles, the rebels have used the Mai-Mai to terrify the ill-disciplined Zairean troops into fleeing.

But aid sources said Bunia was heavily reinforced by Zairean troops from Kinshasa and Kisangani, including elements of the presidential guard -- Zaire's best equipped and trained force.

The rebels now control a 550 km (340 mile) swathe of Zaire's eastern border after capturing the towns of Uvira, Kamanyola, Bukavu, Goma, Butembo, Beni and Kasindi.

Controversy still surrounds what has become of Rwandans driven from refugee camps they had occupied in Zaire since 1994 and local Zaireans driven from their homes by the fighting that began in October.

Estimates of the number of Rwandans who have returned from Zaire ranged from about 560,000 to 700,000 -- far short of the 1.2 million the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says were in Zaire before the fighting.

Aid organisations accused Western governments of playing down the number of remaining refugees to avoid intervention while U.S. diplomats suggest the UNHCR total was exaggerated.

Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril, Canadian commander of the still embryonic multinational force to help Rwandan refugees and displaced Zaireans, said in Rwanda he would visit rebel-held eastern Zaire on Sunday seeking more information.

But the French minister in charge of African affairs said in comments released on Saturday the military force for Zaire that France pressed the world to create was no longer viable.

"It's now out of the question (to deploy the force)," Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain told the weekly newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche. The force has been opposed by both the Kinshasa government and the rebels.

In a by-product of the fighting between the Zaire rebels and the government, Ugandan rebels displaced from bases they had used in Zaire for the past five years are creating havoc along the Zaire-Uganda border.

Zairean and Ugandan villagers streamed from the mountainous region to escape the rampaging Ugandan rebels, accusing the Allied Democratic Forces rebels of looting homes, raping women and abducting children to use as porters.

Squeezed back toward Uganda by the civil war in Zaire, the Ugandan rebels are now being pursued by Ugandan government troops who have regularly criss-crossed the undefined border in pursuit.
