<p>Villagers were streaming out of the mountainous border region on Saturday to escape Ugandan rebels who have been rampaging since they were forced from their bases in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>Both Ugandan and Zairean villagers arriving in the border town of Bwera in eastern Uganda said Allied Democratic Forces rebels were looting homes, raping women and abducting children to use as porters.</p>
<p>The Ugandan rebels, who had waged a guerrilla war from eastern Zaire for about five years, lost their safe haven last month when Zairean government troops were defeated by Banyamulenge rebels.</p>
<p>The Ugandan government, which recognises Kinshasa has lost control of much of eastern Zaire to Zairean rebels, has blamed Sudanese Islamist leader Hassan al-Turabi for the anti-Ugandan rebel attacks.</p>
<p>However, Zaire accuses Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda of sending troops to help the Zairean rebels who have seized a front 550 km (340 miles) long running north-south parallel to Zaire's eastern border.</p>
<p>Squeezed back toward Uganda by the fighting, the Ugandan rebels are now being pursued by Ugandan government troops who have regularly criss-crossed the undefined border by the Rwenzori mountain range.</p>
<p>A growing number of Zairean refugees reaching Uganda tell of fierce fighting between UDA rebels and Ugandan forces inside Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;We fled because the (Ugandan) rebels wanted to kidnap us,&quot; said Katie Kaharunza. &quot;We think it will be safer here.&quot;</p>
<p>Gabriel Bwambari, village headman at Kitholi, about 10 kms from Bwera, said rebels entered the village on Friday night and kidnapped six people. Two were found on Saturday murdered.</p>
<p>Amos Kumiha, headman at nearby Kasanga village, said two people had been killed by rebels early on Saturday morning. The rebels had also stolen goats and chickens.</p>
<p>While the Ugandan army is highly visible in Bwera and some villages in the Rwenzori foothills, some villagers complained they vanish at night and have not pursued the rebels hard enough.</p>
<p>&quot;They shouldn't be down here,&quot; said one man carrying his mattress and a bundle of belongings. &quot;They should be chasing them in the mountains.</p>
<p>The Rwenzori, Africa's highest range, includes the permanently snow-capped &quot;Mountains of the Moon&quot;. Most villages on the slopes live from subsistance farming and the loss of just a goat or chicken can set back family finances for years.</p>
<p>&quot;I have got nothing now,&quot; said Kulish Chinoh, a refugee from Zaire. &quot;The rebels stole everything and my leg is injured from a grenade.&quot;</p>
<p>While most displaced Ugandans could stay with friends or relatives closer to the provincial capital Kasese, headman Bwambari warned that the growing number of Zairean refugees was putting presure on resources.</p>
<p>Refugees in Bwera said thousands of Zairean had fled into the bush to escape the rebels, but most would return as soon as they believe it safe.</p>
<p>They said the Banyamulenge rebels had total control of Kasindi, the first significant Zairean town across the border from Uganda, but the UDA still had much of the intervening countryside.</p>
