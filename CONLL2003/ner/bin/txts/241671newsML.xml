<p>Army rebels in Central African Republic observed a truce on Saturday at the start of foreign mediation in their mutiny that has spiralled into ethnic bloodshed, residents said.</p>
<p>But embattled President Ange-Felix Patasse came under renewed attack from an alliance of opposition parties accusing him of responsibility for ethnic violence following the impoverished nation's third army mutiny this year.</p>
<p>Leaders of 11 alliance parties who were due to meet four African heads of state mediating in Bangui signed a memorandum saying Patasse could no longer guarantee the national unity.</p>
<p>&quot;In the face of the upheaval in the country, the 11 signatory political parties of this memorandum hold President Ange-Felix Patasse solely responsible for the present situation,&quot; said the statement prepared for the mediation presidents from Gabon, Chad, Mali and Burkina Faso.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the parties) note that he is no longer in a position to embody national unity,&quot; added the memorandum, made available to Reuters.</p>
<p>The parties specifically accused Patasse of ignoring political accords that ended a serious army mutiny last May, notably the disarming of foreign forces said to have joined the president's armed civilian militias.</p>
<p>Rebel soldiers who launched their third mutiny this year on November 16 have made the disarming of civilians and mercenaries from Chad and Sudan a prime objective.</p>
<p>They have welcomed the regional mediation initiated by the Franco-African summit which ended in Burkina Faso on Friday.</p>
<p>Residents said rebels, who on Thursday clashed with loyalists soldiers and French troops protecting Patasse, suspended a drive to disarm militias for Saturday's peace mission.</p>
<p>Traffic picked up slowly in the city centre which has been deserted all week. Shops and businesses remain closed.</p>
<p>Residents said despite the calm, tribal killings that have followed the mutiny were continuing, pitting southern Yakomas who dominate the rebel ranks against Patasse's northern Bayas.</p>
<p>They reported abductions and killings by either side, estimating the number of people dragged from their homes and killed summarily in Bangui at up to 10 daily.</p>
<p>Former interior minister Christophe Grelombe, a Yakoma, and his son were seized on Thursday and murdered in an open field.</p>
<p>The mediators first met Patasse, kept in power by French troops during May's bloody revolt. They scheduled talks later in the day with leaders of the latest mutiny and representatives of all political parties, government officials said.</p>
<p>Former colonial power France has voiced backing for the elected government but says its troops based in the country under defence pacts would not help it combat the mutineers.</p>
<p>&quot;French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities,&quot; French President Jacques Chirac told a news conference at the end of the Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso on Friday.</p>
<p>The latest uprising began over pay demands and an attempt by Patasse to redeploy soldiers involved in May's revolt but has turned into a campaign to topple the president. The year's first revolt was in April.</p>
