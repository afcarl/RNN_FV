Ghana - pioneer of African nationalist politics.

ACCRA 1996-12-07

Ghana, rich in gold and pre-colonial history, became a pioneer of African nationalist politics when the winds of change blew through the continent after World War Two.

Its history since independence from Britain in 1957 -- democracy, political instability, army rule, bloody purges, socialist central planning, Western-style free-market economics -- epitomises modern Africa's social and political experience.

The West African gold and cocoa producer's first leader, Kwame Nkrumah, was a founding father of Panafricanism and a figurehead among Africa's independence leaders with his concept of African Socialism until the army toppled him in 1966.

President Jerry Rawlings, an ex-airforce flight-lieutenant, standing for a final term in Saturday's national elections, followed in the footsteps of earlier coup leaders.

He seized power in 1979, executing three former military heads of state, restored civilian rule and then seized power again in 1981. Still only 49, he made the transition to elected president in disputed 1992 multi-party elections.

Ghana takes its name from an ancient empire that lasted from before Jesus Christ to the 12th century. That empire, like its 19th-century Ashanti successor, based its power on gold.

With a population of 17.5 million and a rich cultural and ethnic mix, modern Ghana enjoyed early wealth from cocoa but by the early 1980s corruption, mismanagement and instability had made it one of Africa's poorest nations.

One-time socialist firebrand Rawlings has steered the nation down the road of Western-style free-market liberalisation.

With renewed interest in gold fueling the economy, per capita income reached $464 per head in 1995 but inflation and unemployment remain a major problem.

These are the main facts about Ghana.
