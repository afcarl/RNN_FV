Ethiopia on Saturday opened a two-day photo exhibition honouring Mohamed "Mo" Amin, the award-winning cameraman who brought the country's 1984 famine to world attention. He died aboard a hijacked Ethiopian Airlines plane last month.

Opening the exhibition, the president of the Ethiopian Journalists Association Tadesse Gebre Mariam eulogised Amin as one the most honoured frontline cameramen ever.

Amin, a 53-year-old Kenyan, was on an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767 seized by three hijackers on a flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi on November 23. The airliner ran out of fuel and went down in the sea just off the Comoro Islands.

Only 50 of the 175 passengers and crew survived.

Amin, also a Reuters Television executive, was best-known for bringing Ethiopia's catastrophic famine in 1984 to world attention.

His dramatic pictures jolted the world into a huge relief effort that included the "Live Aid" rock concert beamed around the globe, raising millions of dollars to ease the famine.

"We are gathered here today to pay tribute to the late Mo Amin, the most honoured frontline photo journalist and cameraman who was instrumental in generating massive assistance to millions of Ethiopians who were suffering from starvation during the 1984 famine," Tadesse told hundreds of invited guests.

Some 100 photographs by Amin were on display at the two-day exhibition at the Addis Ababa Municipal Hall. Among the pictures were scenes of the 1984 dying fields in northern Ethiopia where hundreds of thousands starved to death.

Also on display was a cutting of an interview Amin gave to a journalist about his feelings on the Ethiopian famine.

"They (Ethiopians) were dying simply because there was no food. And everytime I think of this particular situation, I get tears in my eyes because it's not imaginable the proud Ethiopian people were dying for lack of food," he said.

He added: "Everywhere I pointed my camera people were dying. Nurses were short of milk, they literally had to decide which hundred or so children out of 5,000 should live."

Amin, a self-taught photographer, worked for Reuters after it took over the television film agency Visnews, later renamed Reuters Television, in 1993.

Amin, who lived in Nairobi, was regarded as one of the world's top photojournalists. He won numerous awards in a career that spanned four decades after he started out with a camera as a 13-year-old schoolboy covering the East African car rally.

He was made a Member of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth, and Order of the Grand Warrior, the highest honour Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has bestowed on a journalist.
