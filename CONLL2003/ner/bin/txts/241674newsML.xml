<p>President Yoweri Museveni has moved to northern Uganda to direct a war against Sudanese-based rebels which the United Nations says has displaced up to 200,000 people and produced horrific human rights abuses.</p>
<p>&quot;He is in overall charge,&quot; John Nagenda, the president's media adviser, told Reuters on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The war was being fought in a pathetic manner,&quot; he said, adding that Museveni went north three weeks ago because army commanders had failed to end the 11-year conflict.</p>
<p>Museveni's senior military advisor, Major-General David Tinyefunza resigned on Wednesday after criticising Museveni's war strategy and calling army commanders incompetent thieves.</p>
<p>As well as battling Christian fundamentalists in the north, Uganda is fighting a separate insurgency in the southwest by Moslem rebels based in Zaire.</p>
<p>A report by the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs said rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and the West Nile Bank Front, both with bases in Sudan, were responsible for grave human rights abuses across the north.</p>
<p>The LRA says it wants to rule Uganda in accordance with the Bible's 10 Commandments. The group took on the mantle of the former Holy Spirit Mobile Force, whose fighters covered themselves in oil which they believed would give them immunity against bullets.</p>
<p>&quot;Services such as health and education are in a state of collapse, while rampant insecurity is undermining the efforts of humanitarian relief agencies to provide even basic emergency assistance,&quot; the U.N. report said.</p>
<p>It said a hospital at Lachor, five km (three miles) from the northern town of Gulu, recently started to receive young people whose feet were hacked off by LRA rebels for riding bicycles.</p>
<p>&quot;Four people can be seen in one ward, deprived of their limbs as a punishment for riding their bicycles, which the LRA seeks to prohibit on the grounds that bike riders can provide military intelligence to the Ugandan army.&quot;</p>
<p>It said all 446 beds at the hospital were full and each evening the hospital and its grounds were crammed with 6,000 people who left their rural homes in fear of rebel attacks.</p>
<p>Up to 200,000 of the 390,000 people in the northern Gulu region were refugees from the fighting. Farmers had left their crops to rot and the LRA had planted landmines, the report said.</p>
<p>It said only a few of 180 primary shools in the region were open, mainly because the LRA took children as forced recruits.</p>
<p>The U.N. Children's Fund estimates 3,000 schoolchildren have been abducted by the rebels in the last two years. It said such abductions were on the increase as the rebels needed fighters.</p>
<p>The U.N. report said every major public building between the hospital and Gulu centre was filled at night. A census by the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) showed more than 15,000 taking shelter in the town after darkness in addition to 30,000 displaced people.</p>
<p>Lachor hospital was feeding 60 severely malnourished children, many of whom had measles.</p>
<p>The U.N. report said only up to nine of the 45 health centres in Gulu district were functioning because most staff had fled. Medical supplies could not get through because of attacks.</p>
<p>It said attacks by rebels of the West Nile Bank Front in the Arua region had increased and killings, abductions and rapes were increasingly similar to the LRA's method of operating.</p>
<p>The Front also attacks Sudanese refugees and agencies helping them. It aims to restore exiled dictator Idi Amin to power.</p>
<p>The report quoted the government-owned New Vision newspaper as saying the Front, the LRA and other rebels agreed in November to coordinate their raids as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).</p>
<p>The ADF, which is believed to include West Nile Bank Front fighters based in Zaire, attacked Bwera town in the southwest on November 13, opening a third front against the hard-pressed Ugandan army.</p>
