African leaders mediate in Central Africa Republic.

BANGUI 1996-12-07

Four African presidents began mediation talks in the Central African Republic on Saturday to end an army mutiny spiralling into ethnic and political bloodshed.

Government officials told Reuters the leaders of Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon and Mali, who were mandated by a Franco-African summit this week, arrived late on Friday seeking a lasting settlement to the third such revolt here this year.

President Ange-Felix Patasse, kept in power by French troops during a bloody revolt in May, leaders of the latest mutiny and representatives of all political parties were to take part in a series of meetings with the presidents, the officials said.

The talks began with Patasse himself, they added.

Former colonial power France has voiced backing for the elected government but says the troops it has based in the country under defence pacts would not help it combat soldiers who began a mutiny on November 16.

"French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities," French President Jacques Chirac told a news conference at the end of the Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso on Friday.

The uprising began over pay demands and an attempt by Patasse to redeploy soldiers involved in May's revolt but has turned into a campaign to topple the president, sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital.

This year's first revolt was in April.
