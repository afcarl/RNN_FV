Sudan fighters reinforce area bordering Eritrea.

KHARTOUM 1996-12-07

The governor of Sudan's eastern Kassala state has called for local fighters to be ready to confront what he called Eritrean "provocations" in the border area, a government-owned newspaper reported on Saturday.

Al-Ingaz al-Watani daily quoted Abul Gasim Ibrahim Mohamad as saying that 1,000 mujahideen (Islamic holy fighters) drawn from Kassala's local councils were ready to defend the eastern front.

He said other steps in the general mobilisation included "combating subversion" by closing off routes, isolating and destroying landmine areas and forming an operations room.

"Women of the state are prepared to provide food for the mujahideen," he was quoted as saying.

Sudan and Eritrea accuse each other of harbouring opposition groups. They severed relations in 1994.

Sudan has asked the United States to mediate in the dispute with its eastern neighbour, Mostafa Osman Ismail, state minister at the foreign affairs ministry, said last month.

He warned Eritrea that Sudan was losing patience with what it said was Asmara's support for Sudanese opposition groups based there. "Sudan is ready to repulse any Eritrean attempt targeting its security or national sovereignty," he added.
