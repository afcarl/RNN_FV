<p>The governor of Sudan's eastern Kassala state has called for local fighters to be ready to confront what he called Eritrean &quot;provocations&quot; in the border area, a government-owned newspaper reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Al-Ingaz al-Watani daily quoted Abul Gasim Ibrahim Mohamad as saying that 1,000 mujahideen (Islamic holy fighters) drawn from Kassala's local councils were ready to defend the eastern front.</p>
<p>He said other steps in the general mobilisation included &quot;combating subversion&quot; by closing off routes, isolating and destroying landmine areas and forming an operations room.</p>
<p>&quot;Women of the state are prepared to provide food for the mujahideen,&quot; he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Sudan and Eritrea accuse each other of harbouring opposition groups. They severed relations in 1994.</p>
<p>Sudan has asked the United States to mediate in the dispute with its eastern neighbour, Mostafa Osman Ismail, state minister at the foreign affairs ministry, said last month.</p>
<p>He warned Eritrea that Sudan was losing patience with what it said was Asmara's support for Sudanese opposition groups based there. &quot;Sudan is ready to repulse any Eritrean attempt targeting its security or national sovereignty,&quot; he added.</p>
