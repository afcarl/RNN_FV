Human rights group hits out at U.N. refugee agency.

NAIROBI 1996-12-07

The human rights group Amnesty International has hit out at the U.N. refugee agency, saying it was condoning the imminent expulsion of half a million Rwandan refugees by Tanzania in contravention of its basic principles.

Amnesty in a statement on Friday said it was concerned at the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and Tanzania's government on Thursday telling the refugees to go home by the end of this month.

It noted their joint statement made no mention of options for those who feared human rights violations if they returned to Rwanda while it was the responsibility of UNHCR and Tanzania as asylum government to ensure that people at risk were protected.

"By issuing this joint statement, UNHCR is effectively rubber-stamping this decision by Tanzania which contravenes its own basic principles of protection of refugees," Amnesty said.

"Instead it should be publicly protesting at Tanzania's decision."

"UNHCR officials have stated that this will not be a forced return, yet the refugees appear not to have been allowed to decide individually whether they can return. A return in these circumstances would effectively amount to forced repatriation.

"Amnesty International appeals for an immediate withdrawal of the decision by the Tanzanian government to expel all Rwandese refugees by 31 December, 1996, and is urging UNHCR to desist from taking actions which would condone this decision."

UNHCR and Tanzania's government have said they believe it is safe for the 542,000 refugees in Tanzania to go home after the return of an estimated 500,000 refugees from Zaire last month.

UNHCR officials say any refugees who refuse to return from Tanzania probably fear reprisals for their role in Rwanda's 1994 genocide and therefore may ultimately lose their refugee status.

UNHCR officials say they have been assured by the Tanzanian government that force will not be used against "ordinary refugees". But the joint statement failed to make any mention of repatriation being voluntary, as required by UNHCR's mandate.

"The refugees are not just an anonymous mass of half a million people who can be treated in an identical fashion," Amnesty said. "There may be many among them who would be at risk on return."

"Over half a million people are being expected to return at less than one month's notice, with apparently no provision for those who continue to fear human rights violations in Rwanda to exercise their right to seek asylum," it added.

It noted the joint UNHCR-Tanzanian statement made no mention of continuing human rights abuses in Rwanda or the detention of some 87,000 prisoners, accused of involvement in the genocide.

"Amnesty International is concerned that the international community has been playing down the real level of human rights violations in Rwanda in order to entice the refugees to return," it said.

Amnesty said to date there were no large-scale arrests of killings of returnees among the 500,000 refugees who returned from Zaire last month after being forced out of their camps by fighting.

"However in view of the persistent pattern of human rights violations in Rwanda it is still much too early to judge their longer-term safety in the country," the Amnesty statement said.

Rwanda's government says it will take legal action against returnees involved in the genocide but only after they have returned to home communes and investigations have been opened.
