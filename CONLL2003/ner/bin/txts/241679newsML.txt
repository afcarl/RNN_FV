Ghana votes for president and parliament.

ACCRA 1996-12-07

Ghanaians voted for a president and parliament on Saturday with President Jerry Rawlings bidding for a final four-year term against a stiff challenge from a new opposition alliance.

Witnesses in the West African nation's capital Accra said queues formed at polling stations before they opened at 7 a.m. (0700 GMT) after a tense campaign marred by sporadic violence.

Polling followed a controversial eve-of-vote nationwide address by Rawlings, who has dominated the life of the former British colony since first seizing power in 1979.

Urging a high turnout, he said the polls held "a very special significance in Ghana's democratic progress" noting that an administration was seeking re-election for the first time.

His rivals -- John Kufuor of the New Patriotic Party and surgeon Edward Mahama of the People's National Convention -- denounced the timing of the address as unfair.

Rawlings's ruling National Democratic Congress faces a strong challenge from an alliance formed by Kufuor's party and the People's Convention Party.

Since independence in 1957 Ghanaians have voted only five times. The army first intervened in 1966 when it ousted nationalist president Kwame Nkrumah.

Rawlings, a former air force flight-lieutenant, took power in 1979, restored civilian rule but seized power again in 1981. Since then, the one-time socialist firebrand has steered Ghana down the road of Western-style economic liberalisation.

Polls close at 5 p.m. (1700 GMT). A run-off will be held in 21 days if no clear winner emerges.
