<p>Ghanaians voted for a president and parliament on Saturday with President Jerry Rawlings bidding for a final four-year term against a stiff challenge from a new opposition alliance.</p>
<p>Witnesses in the West African nation's capital Accra said queues formed at polling stations before they opened at 7 a.m. (0700 GMT) after a tense campaign marred by sporadic violence.</p>
<p>Polling followed a controversial eve-of-vote nationwide address by Rawlings, who has dominated the life of the former British colony since first seizing power in 1979.</p>
<p>Urging a high turnout, he said the polls held &quot;a very special significance in Ghana's democratic progress&quot; noting that an administration was seeking re-election for the first time.</p>
<p>His rivals -- John Kufuor of the New Patriotic Party and surgeon Edward Mahama of the People's National Convention -- denounced the timing of the address as unfair.</p>
<p>Rawlings's ruling National Democratic Congress faces a strong challenge from an alliance formed by Kufuor's party and the People's Convention Party.</p>
<p>Since independence in 1957 Ghanaians have voted only five times. The army first intervened in 1966 when it ousted nationalist president Kwame Nkrumah.</p>
<p>Rawlings, a former air force flight-lieutenant, took power in 1979, restored civilian rule but seized power again in 1981. Since then, the one-time socialist firebrand has steered Ghana down the road of Western-style economic liberalisation.</p>
<p>Polls close at 5 p.m. (1700 GMT). A run-off will be held in 21 days if no clear winner emerges.</p>
