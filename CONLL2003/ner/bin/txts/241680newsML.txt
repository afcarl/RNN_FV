Milosevic says won't use troops to muzzle protests.

President Slobodan Milosevic was quoted on Saturday as saying he would respect the decision of the supreme court considering whether to confirm an opposition victory in Belgrade in local elections.

"He said he would obey what the Supreme Court decides," the visiting head of the U.S. Committee for the Protection of Journalists, Kati Morton, told Reuters after meeting Milosevic.

Belgrade has been shaken by over two weeks of demonstrations after Milosevic's ruling Socialist party annulled a victory by the opposition in 15 Serbian cities, including the capital, in local elections last month.

Lawyers of the Zajedno opposition coalition submitted papers to the supreme court, which was expected to decide over the weekend on the outcome of Belgrade local elections.

The judges can decide whether Zajedno won control of Belgrade or order a review of the result by a lower court which earlier ruled in the Socialists' favour.

Diplomats were wary of predicting the court's ruling but said a decision in favour of the opposition would be the easiest way for Milosevic to resolve the embarrassing stand-off.

Milosevic's comments to Morton came after a Belgrade newspaper published a story clearly seeking to distance the Serbian leader from charges of vote-rigging by saying he misled by some of his officials.

Political sources said the story, attributed to reliable sources close to the Serbian leader, was the first stage of a campaign to rehabilitate Milosevic, who is under strong international pressure to yield to the opposition.

The decision to revoke the opposition victory has turned into a political catastrophe for Milosevic, mobilising daily demonstrations by up to 150,000 people against his nine-year rule and destroying his electoral credibility.

It also badly tarnished his reputation abroad.

"He has managed to squander all his hard-won credibility after the Dayton peace accord," a senior Western diplomat said.

The United States has led a Western campaign to force Milosevic to honour the outcome of the polls.

Morton also said the Serbian leader had promised that the police and army would not intervene to muzzle the protests and would keep the independent Belgrade radio station B-92 on the air.

Morton, wife of former U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke, who secured the Dayton peace accord ending the Bosnian war, said the radio station was the main reason for her visit to Belgrade.

"President Milosevic...said that he would leave Radio B-92 -- which is the main reason for my visit -- in peace.

"The president repeated several times that Radio B-92 would be allowed to work freely and that he would not interfere in its work in the future," B-92 quoted her as saying.

B-92 Radio is the only big independent radio station that covered the demonstrations and has become the symbol of the opposition in Serbia.
