<p>President Slobodan Milosevic was quoted on Saturday as saying he would respect the decision of the supreme court considering whether to confirm an opposition victory in Belgrade in local elections.</p>
<p>&quot;He said he would obey what the Supreme Court decides,&quot; the visiting head of the U.S. Committee for the Protection of Journalists, Kati Morton, told Reuters after meeting Milosevic.</p>
<p>Belgrade has been shaken by over two weeks of demonstrations after Milosevic's ruling Socialist party annulled a victory by the opposition in 15 Serbian cities, including the capital, in local elections last month.</p>
<p>Lawyers of the Zajedno opposition coalition submitted papers to the supreme court, which was expected to decide over the weekend on the outcome of Belgrade local elections.</p>
<p>The judges can decide whether Zajedno won control of Belgrade or order a review of the result by a lower court which earlier ruled in the Socialists' favour.</p>
<p>Diplomats were wary of predicting the court's ruling but said a decision in favour of the opposition would be the easiest way for Milosevic to resolve the embarrassing stand-off.</p>
<p>Milosevic's comments to Morton came after a Belgrade newspaper published a story clearly seeking to distance the Serbian leader from charges of vote-rigging by saying he misled by some of his officials.</p>
<p>Political sources said the story, attributed to reliable sources close to the Serbian leader, was the first stage of a campaign to rehabilitate Milosevic, who is under strong international pressure to yield to the opposition.</p>
<p>The decision to revoke the opposition victory has turned into a political catastrophe for Milosevic, mobilising daily demonstrations by up to 150,000 people against his nine-year rule and destroying his electoral credibility.</p>
<p>It also badly tarnished his reputation abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;He has managed to squander all his hard-won credibility after the Dayton peace accord,&quot; a senior Western diplomat said.</p>
<p>The United States has led a Western campaign to force Milosevic to honour the outcome of the polls.</p>
<p>Morton also said the Serbian leader had promised that the police and army would not intervene to muzzle the protests and would keep the independent Belgrade radio station B-92 on the air.</p>
<p>Morton, wife of former U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke, who secured the Dayton peace accord ending the Bosnian war, said the radio station was the main reason for her visit to Belgrade.</p>
<p>&quot;President Milosevic...said that he would leave Radio B-92 -- which is the main reason for my visit -- in peace.</p>
<p>&quot;The president repeated several times that Radio B-92 would be allowed to work freely and that he would not interfere in its work in the future,&quot; B-92 quoted her as saying.</p>
<p>B-92 Radio is the only big independent radio station that covered the demonstrations and has become the symbol of the opposition in Serbia.</p>
