<p>Russia's leading human rights campaigner Sergei Kovalyov said on Saturday he was worried about a lack of preparation for planned elections in breakaway Chechnya and called for their postponement.</p>
<p>But the secretary of Russia's influential Security Council, Ivan Rybkin, who is also President Boris Yeltsin's personal envoy to Chechnya, insisted the presidential and parliamentary polls slated for January 27 remained on track.</p>
<p>&quot;The preparations are meeting major difficulties and inspire concern,&quot; Kovalyov told NTV commercial television, adding that hundreds of thousands of refugees from the region would be denied the right to vote under present conditions.</p>
<p>Despite an August peace deal between Moscow and Chechnya's pro-independence rebels that halted 21 months of bloody fighting, some 400,000 refugees have still to return home.</p>
<p>Kovalyov, just back from a trip to the oil-rich Caucasian region, also said he was concerned by talk in the Chechen capital Grozny of fielding a single presidential candidate to avoid splitting the separatist movement.</p>
<p>&quot;These undemocratic tendencies are very alarming,&quot; said Kovalyov, who is also a deputy in Russia's state Duma (lower house of parliament).</p>
<p>But Rybkin later told NTV that preparations for the elections were progressing smoothly.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a high level of readiness,&quot; he said. Authorities would make arrangements for refugees to take part in the polls.</p>
<p>Kovalyov told Interfax news agency on Saturday that it would be &quot;unbelievably difficult to fit elections into the planned time span while ensuring that they remained fully legitimate&quot; and suggested they be delayed by a month or more.</p>
<p>Kovalyov said rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev had &quot;positively accepted&quot; his argument for a delay, Interfax said.</p>
<p>The Chechen head of government Aslan Maskhadov also told Kovalyov the idea of postponement &quot;deserved discussion and consideration&quot;, Interfax added. Earlier Maskhadov had said delaying the elections would open the door to &quot;provocations&quot;.</p>
<p>In Chechnya itself there were no signs of any delay on Saturday, the last day for presidential candidates to register their names with the central election commission.</p>
<p>Russian media reported that six candidates had so far stepped forward, including controversial guerrilla leader Shamil Basayev. Yandarbiyev and Maskhadov also intend to run though it was not clear whether they had yet officially registered.</p>
<p>Registered candidates must now gather not less than 10,000 signatures in order to contest the presidency. Itar-Tass news agency said on Saturday that Maskhadov, one of the strongest candidates, had already raised 60,000 signatures.</p>
<p>Kovalyov expressed alarm over Islamic tendencies in Chechnya which he said threatened the division between church and state in the republic, Interfax said.</p>
<p>The former anti-communist dissident was Russia's most strident critic of the Chechen war, in which tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, died. Kovalyov resigned as Yeltsin's human rights commissioner in protest against the war.</p>
<p>Yeltsin recently signed a decree ordering the pullout of Russia's last remaining troops from the region before the poll.</p>
