Croatia rail strike seen continuing for days.

ZAGREB 1996-12-07

Workers of Croatia's ailing state railways, on strike for the ninth day running, said on Saturday a nationwide stoppage of freight trains would continue for at least another two days, state news agency HINA reported.

It quoted Zlatko Pavletic, a senior trade union official, as saying workers were waiting for a ruling by the country's constitutional court on whether the strike was illegal. The court is expected to deliver its decision on Monday.

If the court ruled the industrial action was not in line with legal rights of workers, they would call off their strike, Pavletic said. "We will respect the decision even if it's negative for the strikers," he said.

Eighty percent of all Croatian rail traffic was halted on November 28, when 11,000 employees of the loss-making rail company Hrvatske Zeljeznice (HZ) started their strike, demanding higher wages and better working conditions.

The strikers allowed only trains with supplies for the Croatian army and NATO-led Bosnian peacekeeping forces to roll, maintaining only a legally-required minimum of trains.

But the union bowed to government and management pressures last Wednesday and restarted passenger services.

HZ claimed it was losing an estimated 1.6 million kuna (about $300,000) a day due to the stoppage and risked being unable to pay November wages.

The company denied it had threatened to sack workers who refused to sign written statements condemning the strike, but Pavletic said pressure on strikers was continuing, including official warnings strikers' wages would be cut.

The railway company receives more than one billion kuna ($200 million) from the 1996 budget. The government has said it wants to keep the subsidy below that level next year.

The government, faced with a wave of unrest, refused to give in to the strikers' demands and said there was no money to increase pay this year.
