<title>BOSNIA: Bosnian Serbs refuse to budge over war criminals.</title>

<p>Bosnian Serbs said on Saturday they would not hand over indicted war criminals, despite renewed international pressure to do so and Western threats to deprive them of millions of dollars of reconstruction aid.</p>
<p>Western leaders promised tougher action at a peace review conference in London earlier this week to push Bosnian factions to hand over the dozens of accused still at large.</p>
<p>But they stopped short of authorising the thousands of well- armed NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia to seek out the wanted men and pledged economic punishment instead, a threat the Bosnian Serbs appear not to have taken seriously.</p>
<p>&quot;We emphasised that we cannot comply with the demand for the extradition of war criminals,&quot; said Momcilo Krajisnik, Serb member of Bosnia's joint presidency.</p>
<p>The Dayton peace deal required all Bosnia's factions to hand over wanted men on their territory. International mediators say the failure to do so has undermined faith in the patchily implemented November 1995 accords.</p>
<p>Speaking in the Bosnian Serb headquarters town of Pale outside Sarajevo after returning from London, Krajisnik repeated that the Serbs would set up their own courts.</p>
<p>&quot;Our assembly agreed to create our own war criminals court and we are ready to present, through legal and judicial procedure, all the evidence there is against people from the Republika Srpska (the Serb half of Bosnia).&quot;</p>
<p>Virtually none of the 75 people indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague have been handed over. Croatia, Yugoslavia and Bosnia's Serbs and Croats are all criticised for protecting the accused.</p>
<p>The majority of those sought for crimes against civilians during Bosnia's 43-month war live in the Republika Srpska.</p>
<p>Krajisnik accused the Moslem-Croat federation of &quot;exploiting&quot; the war crimes issue and seeking to arrest people other than those on the Hague lists. But he added that the RS would cooperate with the Tribunal as best it could.</p>
<p>&quot;We were told indicted war criminals could not occupy ruling positions and we respected this,&quot; said Krajisnik.</p>
<p>The most prominent indictees are former Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic and ex-military chief Ratko Mladic, both forced from their posts by intense Western pressure.</p>
<p>In Sarajevo Bosnian President Alia Izetbegovic said he was disappointed the London meeting failed to go beyond threats to withold aid to those harbouring war criminals.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think London took a unanimous and fully decisive attitude on war criminals,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
