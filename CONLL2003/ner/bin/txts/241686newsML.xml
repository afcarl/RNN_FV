<p>Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, facing unprecedented street protests and mounting international criticism, struggled to disengage himself on Saturday from opposition charges of election-rigging.</p>
<p>As the supreme court considered whether to confirm an opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition election victory, the newspaper Dnevni Telegraf published a defence of the former communist general, saying he had been misled by officials.</p>
<p>Meanwhile about 150,000 people turned out on chilly Belgrade streets for the 18th day of protest marches.</p>
<p>Political sources said the Dnevni Telegraf story, which cited reliable sources close to the Serbian leader, was the first shot in a campaign to restore his battered reputation.</p>
<p>Little happens in Serbia without the approval of the autocratic Milosevic  -- a fiery nationalist held largely responsible by the West for the wars that raged across Croatia and Bosnia in the wake of Yugoslavia's collapse and now seen as crucial to the success of the U.S.-brokered Dayton peace plan.</p>
<p>Milosevic also told a U.S. media rights activist on Saturday that he would respect the supreme court's decision.</p>
<p>&quot;He said he would obey what the Supreme Court decides,&quot; the president of the U.S. Committee for the Protection of Journalists, Kati Morton, told Reuters after meeting Milosevic.</p>
<p>Telegraf reported that Milosevic's first instinct was to recognise that his Socialist Party (SPS) had suffered defeat in Belgrade and other cities in the November 17 elections.</p>
<p>The newspaper's source said a senior socialist official had persuaded Milosevic that there were legal grounds to challenge the opposition's win in 60 of 110 Belgrade council seats.</p>
<p>In an interview carried by Telegraf's weekend supplement, Dusan Mihajlovic, leader of SPS satellite party Nova Demokratija, pointed the finger at Socialist Party officials and defended Milosevic.</p>
<p>&quot;The largest portion of responsibility for all of this lies with Socialist organisations in the cities...</p>
<p>&quot;I know for certain that the officials of these organisations did all in their power to turn their defeat into victory in the third round and that president Milosevic has absolutely nothing to do with this,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Western diplomats in Belgrade view Nova Demokratija as a mouthpiece for Milosevic's more liberal views.</p>
<p>Mihajlovic apparently drew a line in the sand up to which Zajedno can go with their demands.</p>
<p>&quot;Leaders of Zajedno wrongly concluded...this was a chance to ask for the president Milosevic's resignation.</p>
<p>&quot;The question of who rules Serbia will not be resolved on the streets but next year at parliamentary elections,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The decision to revoke the opposition victory has turned into a political catastrophe for Milosevic, mobilising daily demonstrations by up to 150,000 people against his nine-year rule and destroying his electoral credibility.</p>
<p>The United States has led a Western campaign to force Milosevic to honour the polls and open talks with Zajedno.</p>
<p>&quot;This is no time for business as usual on Serbia. This is a time for the democratic process to move forward in Serbia,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said on Friday.</p>
<p>The strong words from Washington followed a decision by the European Union to refuse Belgrade preferential trade terms granted to its Balkan neighbours.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 protesters thronged central Belgrade on Saturday after Zajedno's lawyers submitted papers to the supreme court, which was expected to decide over the weekend on the outcome of Belgrade local elections.</p>
<p>The judges can decide whether Zajedno won control of Belgrade or order a review of the result by a lower court which earlier ruled in the socialists' favour.</p>
<p>The mood on the streets was euphoric as the conviction grew that the sustained protests had inflicted severe damage on Milosevic's rule.</p>
<p>As many as 40,000 students marched through the streets and littered the pavement with old newspaprs in front of the state-run Tanjug ness agency which they accuse of biased reporting of their demonstrations.</p>
<p>Hours later Zajedno leader Vesna Pesic said: &quot;We want parliamentary rule in Serbia -- we want the authorities to fear the people - not vice versa.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a huge investment in the future of Serbia,&quot; she told a crowd of more than 150,000 people.</p>
<p>A poll in NIN magazine showed Milosevic was suffering politically, with a fall in his public support from 26 to 16.5 percent since the demonstrations began.</p>
