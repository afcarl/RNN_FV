<p>Student protesters on Saturday scented success for a combined opposition-student campaign against the government that has filled the streets of Belgrade with demonstrators daily for more than two weeks.</p>
<p>As many as 40,000 students and their supporters have joined protests of up to 150,000 people to demand that the government of President Slobodan Milosevic accept the democratic process and reverse its move to cancel opposition victories in local elections on November 17.</p>
<p>On a day that a popular newspaper hinted Milosevic was distancing himself from party officials who annulled the opposition victory and following news that the Supreme Court was reviewing the annullments, students taking part sensed cracks within the government's approach.</p>
<p>&quot;The Supreme Court hearing is an elegant way out for him (Milosevic),&quot; said a 24-year-old forestry student named Bojan.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the court will rule in favour of the opposition. Then the authorities can say the courts are independent and have delivered justice, and that they respect the law. But we all know the truth -- we were raped in the elections.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is a turning point,&quot; said language student Teodor. &quot;In my opinion it is over for them. The election results were a huge surprise and they didn't expect such a big opposition win. But they were totally unprepared for such public outrage.&quot;</p>
<p>He argued the government was desperately looking for a face-saving device to extricate itself from the situation.</p>
<p>Thousands of students blew whistles and trumpets, tossed balloons and shook noise-makers as the festive prosession moved to the offices of the state news agency Tanjug where they tossed torn newspapers in protest at what they called biased reporting of their marches.</p>
<p>Milosevic's handling of the elections and his subsequent moves to gag independent media reporting on the demonstrations has also drawn widespread international criticism.</p>
<p>&quot;It is crazy that a friend from Heidelberg (Germany) knows more about what is going on than my own brother who lives in Leskovac only 200 kilometres (120 miles) away,&quot; mathematics undergraduate Damian Stanojevic, 19, said.</p>
<p>&quot;All the foreign reporters and TV cameras show us how much the world is interested in us, and how much they want to see us win. It is easier to come out if you know people are watching.&quot;</p>
<p>While undergraduates made up the bulk of the student marches hundreds of supporters joined their parade.</p>
<p>&quot;Our youth is intelligent -- they think for themselves, and not through their (state-controlled) television screens,&quot; said engineer Jovan Radinovic. &quot;They are for progress and I agree with what they say about the elections.&quot;</p>
<p>Radinovic has brought his wife and 12-year-old son to the student demonstrations each day, and said he has no fear that the marches will disolve into violence.</p>
<p>&quot;Only if the authorities shoot at us first will anything go wrong and I think now they understand how dangerous that would be. It would be suicidal.&quot;</p>
<p>The West has delivered a stern warning to Milosevic not to use force to quench the demonstrations.</p>
<p>Others said at the start of the demonstrations they were too afraid to join in, but grew more confident as the weeks passed without serious incident.</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn't sure at first,&quot; said law student Azanec who brought her seven-month old daughter Zorana to the march for the first time on Saturday. &quot;But now I realise that as long as they (the authorities) don't attack us, we have no reason to be agressive.&quot;</p>
