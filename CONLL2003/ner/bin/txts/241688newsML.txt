MOSCOW 1996-12-07

Tajikistan President Imamali Rakhmonov said on Saturday he planned to meet opposition leader Sayid Adbullo Nuri early next week despite the latest flare-up in fighting in the former Soviet republic.

Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Rakhmonov as telling a meeting of pro-government parties in the capital Dushanbe that he would meet Nuri on Monday in northern Afghanistan, where opposition forces fled in 1992 after defeat in a civil war.

There was no word from the opposition on whether Nuri was planning to meet Rakhmonov.

Rakhmonov said he aimed at signing a ceasefire deal with Nuri to stop the latest fighting which broke out last week.

Russia's RIA news agency said government troops fought with rebels on Thursday in the central Tajikistan town of Garm to try and lift a rebel siege now in its seventh day.

On Thursday Islamist fighters delivered an ultimatum to the government battallion locked in Garm to lay down their arms and gain safe passage, or face destruction.

The Tajik government said on Friday its troops freed the city of Komsomolabad, which stands on the way to Garm.

As fighting continued Russian forces reinforced positions in eastern Tajikistan, where sporadic clashes also took place.

Tajik interior ministry officials reported a clash in the village of Chinor near Nurek, 60 km (37 miles) east of Dushanbe.

Russian military sources said on Friday Russia's 201st motor-rifle division had brought in reinforcments to Nurek where it guards a strategically-important hydro-electric power station.

Russia has troops in Tajikistan, where the government and Islamist guerrillas have been fighting for nearly five years under an agreement to help patrol the frontier.

In a separate development two United Nations bodies condemned the Tajik opposition for trying to prevent refugees living in northern Afghanistan from having any contact with the United Nations.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Mission in Tajikistan (UNHCR) and the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) said that at least on two occasions rebel fighters had detained refugees who contacted them.

They said in a joint press release that last Tuesday armed opposition fighters forced 17 refugees, who were returning after consultations in the UNHCR office in the Afghan town of Kunduz, from a U.N. bus and took them to an unknown location.
