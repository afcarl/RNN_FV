Tirana hails EU stand on Belgrade trade terms.

TIRANA 1996-12-07

Albania on Saturday hailed Europe's decision not to grant Yugoslavia preferential trade terms, saying it would further regional peace and stability.

European Union foreign ministers snubbed rump Yugoslavia on Friday, refusing to give it the trade terms already granted to other countries in the Balkans and voicing concern over the "undemocratic annulment" of November 17 local election results.

"This decision is a direct benefit not only to... democratic forces in Serbia but to peace and stability in the region as well," Albanian President Sali Berisha said in a statement.

The European decision was "a real contribution for the application of the Dayton agreement", Berisha added.

"Today's Yugoslav mini-federation based on violence, pressure, nationalism and chauvinism is as much of a threat (to the region) as the artificial multi-federation based on the same inhuman principles five years ago," he continued.

Albania has repeatedly expressed concern about tension in the Serbian region of Kosovo, which boycotted the last Yugoslav elections, calling for dialogue between Belgrade and the mostly ethnic-Albanian region.
