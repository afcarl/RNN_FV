<p>Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on Saturday criticised what he said was alliance between Western powers and &quot;internal enemies&quot; -- opposition parties, human rights groups and independent media.</p>
<p>He said the alliance was plotting to dethrone him and his ruling nationalist HDZ party.</p>
<p>&quot;We are witnessing an alliance of foreign and internal opponents of the HDZ and Croatia,&quot; Tudjman said in an hour-long address to the HDZ annual congress.</p>
<p>&quot;They are trying to destabilise the country, but with minimum results. However, they struggling to make it look like the opposition is getting stronger and the HDZ's reputation is declining,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The invective, probably the strongest since the HDZ came to power in 1990, turned on an exhaustive list of  &quot;foreign mercenaries&quot; and &quot;political dilettants&quot; who have sought political and financial help from the West.</p>
<p>&quot;All this was happening while the HDZ was busy fighting for Croatian freedom and independence,&quot; said Tudjman, referring to the 1991 war that followed the country's secession from communist Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The 74-year old president, reportedly ill with cancer, has often been accused of autocratic rule and his nationalist HDZ is under growing pressure to account for alleged corruption and abuse of power.</p>
<p>The HDZ is facing a huge decline in popularity and the government in the last two weeks refused to give in to popular protests as public workers, pensioners and railwaymen staged strikes to demand more money.</p>
<p>But Tudjman said the HDZ was sure of winning again in the 1997 presidential and local election.</p>
<p>He particularly slammed American businessman George Soros, whose foundation &quot;Open Society&quot; finances several media and cultural projects to promote democracy in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;With Soros's help they have infiltrated the entire society. They grant scholarships to all sorts of people and all generations... and they clearly state their aim is to change the ownerhip structure of the media,&quot; Tudjman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do we need such things, now that we have procured freedom and democracy?,&quot; Tudjman said.</p>
<p>Croatia's bid for admission into the Council of Europe was shelved in May, in part due to its suppressing free media and promoting state-controlled journalists. The country was accepted in October but remains under scrutiny.</p>
<p>He accused Soros, &quot;other American and European foundations&quot; and some Western embassies in Croatia of supporting the opposition, helping several small magazines and systematically enlarging the scope of their activities.</p>
<p>&quot;They are subsidising libraries, high schools, planning to launch a new political magazine and a TV station ahead of the next year's election,&quot; Tudjman said.</p>
<p>He criticised the two strongest opposition parties -- The Social Liberals and The Peasants Party -- of inciting social unrest and disobedience after &quot;falling under the influence&quot; of what he called foreign enemies.</p>
<p>The HDZ's attempt to shut down independent Radio 101 two weeks ago mobilised 100,000 citizens in Zagreb's main square. The rally turned into a wider call from more democracy.</p>
