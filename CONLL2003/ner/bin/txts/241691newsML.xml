<title>SLOVENIA: Slovenia to vote on changes to electoral system.</title>
<headline>Slovenia to vote on changes to electoral system.</headline>
<dateline>LJUBLJANA 1996-12-07</dateline>

<p>Slovenia's 1.5 million voters get a chance in a referendum on Sunday to select a new electoral system from three offer, but only about a third of them seem to know which one they want, according to a public opinion poll.</p>
<p>The survey published in the newspaper Dnevnik on Friday suggested 60 percent of the electorate would vote in the referendum, which takes place a month after a general election.</p>
<p>The parliamentary poll on November 10 was inconclusive, with neither right nor left gaining a mandate to run the government.</p>
<p>In Sunday's vote, the centre-right Social Democrats have proposed a two-round majority electoral system under which a candidate who managed in the end to secure an absolute majority would succeed in each of Slovenia's 88 voting districts.</p>
<p>This system acknowledges that, because many candidates compete for each seat, it would be unlikely for anyone to get more than 50 percent of votes, so the two candidates who score highest in the first round would go on to a one-to-one contest.</p>
<p>The centre-left Liberal Democrats (LDS), Slovenia's strongest party, favours a proportional representation system in which each party would put up a list of 88 candidates. At present each party is represented in each electoral district with one candidate.</p>
<p>The National Council, the lower house of Slovenia's parliament, proposes a model combining Social Democrat and LDS suggestions. In it, half of the 88 candidates would be elected on the basis of a two-round run-off system and the other half by proportional representation.</p>
<p>Each voter chooses both an individual candidate from their electoral district and a party, although the elected candidate does not have to be from the party chosen.</p>
<p>The National Council says its model will increase the chances of independent candidates entering the parliament.</p>
<p>The two-round majority model received 17 percent support in the public opinion poll in Dnevnik, proportional representation 12.1 percent and the combined system 12.7 percent.</p>
<p>More than half those polled were still undecided.</p>
<p>Voting in the referendum begins at 0600 GMT and ends at 1800 GMT. Initial unofficial results are expected on Sunday evening and the final official result will be announced on Thursday.</p>
