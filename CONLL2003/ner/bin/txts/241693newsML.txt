Bulgaria to resume flights to Gulf.

SOFIA 1996-12-07

Bulgaria's Balkan airline will resume its regular flights to the Gulf from December 21 after cancelling them last month, newspapers said on Saturday.

The new board of directors of debt-ridden Balkan has decided to resume the flights from Sofia to Kuwait, Bahrain and Dubai as planes flying to these destinations were always full, newspapers quoted airline officials as saying.

In an effort to reduce its losses, Balkan's previous management decided to cut some flights as 34 of its 59 international routes were loss-making, officials said.

The Finance Ministry replaced the board last month and appointed Valeri Doganov as the airline's executive director.
