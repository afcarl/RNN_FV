Yeltsin appoints liberal Shakhrai to Kremlin team.

MOSCOW 1996-12-07

Russian President Boris Yeltsin has appointed Sergei Shakhrai, a former deputy prime minister, as deputy head of the Kremlin administration, Interfax news agency said on Saturday.

Yeltsin, who is recovering from heart surgery at a country residence near Moscow, met Shakhrai on Saturday and also appointed him as his representative to Russia's Constitutional Court, Interfax said, quoting parliamentary sources.

The Kremlin was not immediately able to confirm the report.

Shakhrai, a moderate loathed by the communist opposition, resigned as deputy prime minister last January in order to take up a place in the State Duma lower house of parliament. He is also chairman of the centrist Party of Russian Unity and Accord.

Once a close ally of and adviser to Yeltsin, Shakhrai held a variety of responsibilities in the government after joining it in 1992 but he was gradually sidelined as the president moved towards a more conservative, nationalist stance.

The communists, who dominate the Duma, accuse Shakhrai of helping Yeltsin break up the Soviet Union in December 1991.
