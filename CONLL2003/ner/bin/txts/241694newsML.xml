<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin has appointed Sergei Shakhrai, a former deputy prime minister, as deputy head of the Kremlin administration, Interfax news agency said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who is recovering from heart surgery at a country residence near Moscow, met Shakhrai on Saturday and also appointed him as his representative to Russia's Constitutional Court, Interfax said, quoting parliamentary sources.</p>
<p>The Kremlin was not immediately able to confirm the report.</p>
<p>Shakhrai, a moderate loathed by the communist opposition, resigned as deputy prime minister last January in order to take up a place in the State Duma lower house of parliament. He is also chairman of the centrist Party of Russian Unity and Accord.</p>
<p>Once a close ally of and adviser to Yeltsin, Shakhrai held a variety of responsibilities in the government after joining it in 1992 but he was gradually sidelined as the president moved towards a more conservative, nationalist stance.</p>
<p>The communists, who dominate the Duma, accuse Shakhrai of helping Yeltsin break up the Soviet Union in December 1991.</p>
