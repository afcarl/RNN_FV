Policy on Bosnia aid conditions unclear say envoys.

A tough warning that economic aid to Bosnia will be linked to compliance with key parts of the Dayton peace accord masks disputes and indecision within the international community, diplomats say.

The London peace review conference ended on Thursday with the buzzword "conditionality" on everybody's lips, but with little clarity on how the West's new policy was to be implemented.

The word was taken to mean that millions of dollars of reconstruction money would be linked directly to the implementation of major sections of the Dayton peace deal by Bosnian Serb, Moslem or Croat authorities.

Diplomats warn that major breaches of Dayton, like the failure to hand over war criminals or to allow refugees to live amongst their former foes, could be ignored for the sake of fostering reconciliation by boosting local economies with aid.

Some organisations want aid spending to be judged only by economic criteria, others to have it tied to changes of behaviour they might reasonably expect to occur, such as cooperation with joint governing institutions.

"Conditionality means different things to different people," said one Western diplomat familiar with continuing debates on the matter.

"The thinking on conditionality has sharpened as a consequence of London but its certainly not yet an exact science," said Colum Murphy, spokesman for Carl Bildt, the international peace mediator in Bosnia.

"I don't yet think in Washington, London and Paris there is agreement on a nice neat plan for how this will work."

The central problem, diplomats say, is how to deal with the Bosnian Serbs, who have ignored much of Dayton to pursue their goal of ethnic separation from Moslems and Croats, regardless of the cost.

Of $880 million spent so far, only $11 million has gone to the Republika Srpska, the Serb half of Bosnia, which has slumped into poverty. Further obstinacy could cost the Serbs more than $1 billion in lost assistance.

The Serbs, convinced they would never receive aid, saw no reason to cooperate and implement Dayton. Diplomats felt they had lost any leverage over Bosnian Serb behaviour.

Now, heartened by persuading the Serbs to participate in Bosnia's joint presidency, diplomats believe a jump-start programme of aid will encourage the recalcitrant separatists they have more to gain from cooperation than defiance.

"They painted themselves into a corner, now they need to be teased out so the aid carrot actually works," one envoy said.

"In an effort to catch up with what has not happened in Srpska (the Serb Republic) donors are looking at what more can be done," said Rory O'Sullivan, director of World Bank operations in Bosnia.

The World Bank is preparing some $300 million worth of projects to benefit Bosnian Serbs next year. But O'Sullivan warned the projects could be gutted if donors decide on a strict definition of "conditionality" the Serbs fail to meet.

"We are now in a different ball-game from 1996. People are prepared to be tougher but we're also willing to give the Serbs a chance," said O'Sullivan.

Human rights agencies say it is wrong to give any aid to the Bosnian Serbs before they drop their steadfast refusal to hand over dozens of indicted war criminals.

A lack of signals to the contrary suggest the war criminal issue will be at least temporarily put to the side in favour of hastening Bosnia's rehabilitation after 43 months of war.

Bildt has warned against stop-go funding, or "micro- conditionality." To avoid that, diplomats suggest aid could be released in tranches once certain criteria are met.
