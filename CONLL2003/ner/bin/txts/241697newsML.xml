<p>The Slovak parliament on Saturday, after a marathon session lasting until early morning, approved the 1997 state budget with a planned deficit of 36.9 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The 150-seat parliament passed the budget with 80 votes in favour and 15 against from the 95 deputies present.</p>
<p>The budget is planned with revenues of 171.1 billion crowns, up from the planned revenue of 162.4 billion crowns in 1996.</p>
<p>Expenditure is expected to be at 208.0 billion up from 189.4 billion in 1996.  </p>
<p>The original finance ministry draft foresaw incomes of 170 billion crowns and expenditures of 206.9 billion.</p>
<p>A senior finance ministry official however told Reuters in parliament that several ammendments to the budget will bring the risk of an increased overall deficit by up to one billion crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;Parliament approved several ammendments which in total can increase the overall deficit by 400 million to one billion crowns over the year,&quot; the official who did not wish to be named said.</p>
<p>The overall budget deficit is planned at 36.9 billion crowns, compared with the planned deficit of 27 billion crowns this year.  </p>
<p>The ammendments included a clause that the state would refund tax from diesel oil consumed in agriculture and rail transport at a fixed sum of 7,500 crowns a tonne, which could increase the deficit by some 900 million crowns. A further 100 million crowns was in the form of various increases for individual ministries.</p>
<p>The budget is based on an assumption of growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) of 6.4 percent next year with all-year inflation at under six percent.</p>
<p>The 1997 budget expects GDP to total some 660 billion crowns up from 1996 forecasts of 588 billion.  </p>
<p>The budget allocates some 25 billion crowns of the 1997 deficit for the country's debt servicing.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Sergej Kozlik on Thursday said that, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) standards, the 1997 fiscal deficit should total only some 11.7 billion crowns, representing 1.8 percent of the forecast GDP.</p>
<p>In 1996 the fiscal deficit calculated according to IMF standards is planned to total some eight billion crowns, or 1.36 percent of the forecast GDP.</p>
<p>Slovakia's state budget deficit totalled 13.4 billion crowns for the January-September period of 1996, up from a 7.9 billion crown shortfall for the first eight months of this year.</p>
