West demands Milosevic overturn poll fraud.

The United States demanded that the Serbian government open talks with the opposition, as President Slobodan Milosevic faced a deepening crisis over election rigging.

The U.S. State Department said Serbia needed to open a dialogue with the Zajedno (Together) opposition after 19 days of street demonstrations against vote-rigging in local elections.

It was not sufficient for the ruling Socialists to allow independent radio stations to resume broadcasting and to merely "think about" reversing a decision to annul the opposition victory in municipal polls, U.S. spokesman Nichols Burns said on Friday.

"This is no time for business as usual on Serbia. This is a time for the democratic process to move forward in Serbia," he said.

Unimpressed with concessions by Milosevic over recent days, Washington and European states have insisted the ruling Socialists confirm opposition victories in Belgrade and other major towns.

With Milosevic seen as one of the guarantors of the U.S.-brokered Bosnia peace agreement, Western powers were slow to react when opposition demonstrations began after the November 17 local elections.

But as the street protests gained momentum and media attention, Washington and its allies have adopted an increasingly tough line and warned Belgrade against using force to put down the protests.

The strong words from the State Department followed a decision by the European Union to refuse Belgrade preferential trade terms granted to its Balkan neighbours.

A demonstration in the capital on Friday resembled a victory carnival as opposition supporters grew confident they had gained the upper hand in a campaign to overturn poll fraud.

Almost 150,000 protesters thronged the city centre after lawyers for the Zajedno coalition submitted papers to the supreme court, which was expected to decide over the weekend on the outcome of Belgrade local elections.

The supreme court was reviewing a decision to annul a landmark victory for the opposition in the capital.

Amid signs that Milosevic was ceding ground, a Zajedno legal spokesman said: "I am not prepared to forecast the outcome."

The judges can decide whether Zajedno won control of Belgrade or order a review of the result by a lower court which earlier ruled in the socialists' favour.

The court previously rejected an appeal from Zajedno, prompting several judges to issue a public protest in which they accused their colleagues of bowing to political pressure.

The mood on the streets was euphoric as the conviction grew that the sustained protests had inflicted severe damage on the autocratic Milosevic.

In front of the state television building -- a symbol of Milosevic's authoritarian rule -- demonstrators lit hundreds of candles and crossed themselves, saying they were "mourning the death of truth".

Socialist sources fuelled speculation that Milosevic would surrender Belgrade and possibly the industrial town of Nis to end protests that are threatening to paralyse his government.

Zajedno leader Zoran Djindjic told demonstrators the opposition's aim was still to oust Milosevic.

"We are not concealing our main aim -- to remove Slobodan Milosevic from power," he said. "But we want to do this in a fair way, in a fair political struggle, and the first step is the recognition of the election results."

Zajedno spokesman Slobodan Vuksanovic denied that the opposition was bargaining with Milosevic over a compromise. "The Socialists must admit their defeat in Belgrade, Nis and Kraljevo," he said.

A poll in NIN magazine showed Milosevic was suffering politically, with a fall in his public support from 26 to 16.5 percent since the demonstrations began.

In the immediate aftermath of the elections, the Socialists admitted they lost in Belgrade before changing their minds and persuading the municipal court to overturn the result.

Zajedno claims it also won in Nis, Serbia's second city, as well as other other towns. The Socialists have already confirmed opposition victories in several major towns.
