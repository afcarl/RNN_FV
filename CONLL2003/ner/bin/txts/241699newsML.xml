<p>Chilean novelist Jose Donoso, whose books combined dark surrealism and social satire, died on Saturday at the age of 71, his family said.</p>
<p>He was Chile's best-known novelist and one of the key writers of the Latin American literary boom of the 1960s, along with Colombia's Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Peru's Mario Vargas Llosa, with whom he was sometimes compared.</p>
<p>Donoso, who suffered from chronic liver disease and had been in and out of hospitals since late 1994, died peacefully on Saturday among friends and family at his home in Santiago, his niece Claudia Donoso said.</p>
<p>At the annual Santiago Book Fair, where Donoso gave a lecture a few days ago, employees at the stand of his publisher, Alfaguara, wept at the news, hung a portrait of him and gave him a round of applause.</p>
<p>Donoso's novels, which include &quot;Coronacion&quot; (Coronation) and &quot;El obsceno pajaro de la noche&quot; (The Obscene Bird of the Night), often centred on high-class Chileans clinging to their privileges and social graces while living in worlds of violence, disintegrating values and sexual ambiguities.</p>
<p>His dense, elaborately constructed plots mixed nightmarish surrealism with black comedy in a style that some critics considered heavy -- &quot;one of the most complex and demanding in the modern Spanish language,&quot; one critic wrote.</p>
<p>Some of his 20-some novels and volumes of short stories were compared to works by Henry James and Marcel Proust and were widely translated.</p>
<p>One of his best-known works, the 1966 novel &quot;El lugar sin limites&quot; (translated to English as Hell Has No Limits), deals with an ageing transvestite and a small-town brothel madam who entertain the local political boss.</p>
<p>Among his other works are &quot;Este domingo&quot; (This Sunday, 1966), &quot;Casa de campo&quot; (Country House, 1978), and &quot;El jardin de al lado&quot; (The Garden Next Door, 1981). His last novel, &quot;Donde van a morir los elefantes&quot; (Where Elephants Go to Die), published in 1995, was about a Chilean literature professor who goes to teach at a college in the U.S. Midwest.</p>
<p>Donoso had a long association with the United States and taught at the University of Iowa, Dartmouth University and Princeton. He twice had a Guggenheim Fellowship.</p>
<p>He was born on Sept. 25, 1925, in Santiago and worked on a Patagonian sheep ranch as a youth. In 1949, he won a literary scholarship to study at Princeton University in New Jersey, where two stories he wrote in English for a local literary journal were among his first published works.</p>
<p>Donoso lived in Spain from 1967 until the early 1980s and wrote many of his most famous novels there.</p>
<p>He was often critical of what he viewed as the crass commercialism of Chile's prosperous society in the 1990s and said Latin America's publishing industry was spending too much time chasing profits at the expense of good writing.</p>
<p>&quot;Chile is a country that has forgotten its soul,&quot; he said in an interview last year. &quot;There is not enough space for literature because in countries like this, economists put a price on reading in line with the laws of the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Bearded, bespectacled and weak from disease, Donoso said writing had become psychological torture for him. &quot;The agony of having to write is terrible, of feeling empty, that you amount to nothing,&quot; he said in October last year.</p>
<p>Donoso and his wife Pilar Serrano had one daughter, Pilar. Family members said Donoso would be buried on Sunday in the seaside town of Zapallar.</p>
