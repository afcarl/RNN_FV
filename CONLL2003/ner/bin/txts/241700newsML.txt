Peru's anti-terrorism police said on Saturday they had captured the second highest-ranking leader of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla movement.

Police sources told Reuters that Elizabeth Cardenas Huayta, alias "Comrade Sunrise," was arrested earlier this week in the highland city of Ayacucho after a secret surveillance operation spanning more than two months.

"This is a resounding blow against Shining Path's military aparatus given that she is a crucial element of the party who has been a leader since the beginning of the conflict," said one anti-terrorism source, who asked not to be named.

Police were holding Cardenas Saturday in Ayacucho, the birthplace of Shining Path's 16-year uprising, but planned to bring her to the capital Lima later in the day.

The sources said she would be presented to the public at the anti-terrorism police's headquarters on Monday prior to her trial for treason, a charge which carries a life sentence.

Although greatly weakened since its heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Shining Path has been increasingly active this year with a series of car-bombs, assassinations and clashes with security forces.

The group's current leader, Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias "Comrade Feliciano," is believed to be hiding in the eastern jungle regions.

Wars unleashed by Shining Path and the smaller Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) have cost at least 30,000 lives and $25 billion in infrastructure damage since 1980.
