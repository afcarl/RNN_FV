<p>Peru's anti-terrorism police said on Saturday they had captured the second highest-ranking leader of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla movement.</p>
<p>Police sources told Reuters that Elizabeth Cardenas Huayta, alias &quot;Comrade Sunrise,&quot; was arrested earlier this week in the highland city of Ayacucho after a secret surveillance operation spanning more than two months.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a resounding blow against Shining Path's military aparatus given that she is a crucial element of the party who has been a leader since the beginning of the conflict,&quot; said one anti-terrorism source, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Police were holding Cardenas Saturday in Ayacucho, the birthplace of Shining Path's 16-year uprising, but planned to bring her to the capital Lima later in the day.</p>
<p>The sources said she would be presented to the public at the anti-terrorism police's headquarters on Monday prior to her trial for treason, a charge which carries a life sentence.</p>
<p>Although greatly weakened since its heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Shining Path has been increasingly active this year with a series of car-bombs, assassinations and clashes with security forces.</p>
<p>The group's current leader, Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias &quot;Comrade Feliciano,&quot; is believed to be hiding in the eastern jungle regions.</p>
<p>Wars unleashed by Shining Path and the smaller Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) have cost at least 30,000 lives and $25 billion in infrastructure damage since 1980.</p>
