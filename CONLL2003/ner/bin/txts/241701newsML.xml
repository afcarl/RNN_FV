<p>Subcommander Marcos, Mexico's Zapatista guerrilla leader, on Friday ordered six fellow rebel negotiators back to their mountain bases, saying peace negotiations were in crisis.</p>
<p>For more than a week, Marcos and his Indian rebel colleagues have been negotiating with congressional peace mediators in this city in the southeastern state of Chiapas, seeking to draw up a bill on Indian rights to be written into the constitution before Dec. 15.</p>
<p>But after the government made some &quot;observations&quot; on the proposed bill this week, the rebels interpreted that as a demand for changes and Marcos declared the 20-month-old, lurching peace process in crisis.</p>
<p>He said in a statement that early on Friday he had sent the six back to the Zapatista National Liberation Front mountain bases &quot;to guarantee their security that has been thrown into danger by the insecurity surrounding the current crisis.&quot;</p>
<p>Officially, they have not been in talks with President Ernesto Zedillo's government since September. Marcos broke off the dialogue, arguing that a February agreement strengthening rights for Indians in the impoverished state of Chiapas had led nowhere.</p>
<p>That led the congressional mediating team, known as Cocopa, to start shuttle talks between the rebels and the Interior Ministry, seeking consensus on the draft bill that would help lead to the renewal of full-blown peace talks.</p>
<p>But Congress is scheduled to go into recess on Dec. 15, and the Zapatistas have urged that the constitutional changes be approved before then. Marcos said he would like to sign a full peace deal before mid-1997, but successful passage of the Indian rights bill was a necessary first step.</p>
<p>Indian rights were one of the main demands of the Zapatistas when they rose up in arms in January 1994, in a brief rebellion in which 145 people were killed.</p>
