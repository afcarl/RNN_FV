<p>The parents of Lori Berenson, an American who has been imprisoned for life in Peru on a treason conviction, arrived at the Andean city of Puno on Saturday hoping to see her for the first time in a year.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been hell for us. We've waited a year, but it must have seemed like 20 years to her,&quot; her father, Mark Berenson, told Reuters. &quot;Now we can see her and talk to her.&quot;</p>
<p>Lori Berenson, 27, was sentenced by a &quot;faceless&quot; military court in January to life imprisonment for treason and is in solitary confinement at the Yanamayo maximum-security prison in the 13,000-foot-high (4,000 metres) Andean city of Puno.</p>
<p>But her parents, who travelled from New York, did not know if they would see their daughter close up or through a screen. By law, they had to wait a year before visiting her.</p>
<p>She has lost weight, has laryngitis and suffers altitude-related ailments such as dizzy spells and circulation problems which leave her hands swollen and cut, her parents said.</p>
<p>She was sentenced for allegedly helping plot a takeover of the Peruvian Congress by the Cuban-style guerrilla group, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). Two members of her immediate family -- comprising her mother, father and sister -- will now be able to have direct contact with her once a month.</p>
<p>Her parents have been kept informed on how she is coping with the extreme cold at night and inadequate food through occasional &quot;cheerful but censored&quot; letters and monthly visits by the U.S. Embassy and her Peruvian lawyer Grimaldo Achahui.</p>
<p>&quot;It's brutal up there. I can't believe anyone can survive for very long. The system seems aimed to provoke a slow death,'' Mark Berenson said.</p>
<p>Since her conviction, there has been a coordinated campaign in the United States -- actively supported by former President Jimmy Carter -- to annul the decision of the military court, where anonymous judges usually wear hoods and do not allow cross-examination of witnesses.</p>
<p>Diplomatic pressure from Washington has also led Peru's President Alberto Fujimori to say he was considering a deal in which Berenson could be transferred to the United States.</p>
<p>While Berenson's legal team have welcomed the political moves, the lawyers still hope to prove she is innocent.</p>
<p>Peru's police and military accused Berenson of renting a house in Lima as a front for the MRTA guerrillas, transporting arms, helping to psychologically prepare rebel fighters, and gathering intelligence for a possible attack on the Peruvian Congress by posing as a journalist for U.S.-based magazines.</p>
