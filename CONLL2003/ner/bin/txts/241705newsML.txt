Mexican leader sends secret message to rebels.

MEXICO CITY 1996-12-07

Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo sent a message to Zapatista rebel leader Subcommander Marcos in a bid to get peace talks restarted, officials said on Saturday.

Zedillo sent the confidential missive on Friday, the same day Marcos said the peace process was "in crisis" and ordered six of his fellow rebel negotiators back to their jungle bases in the southern state of Chiapas.

"The message from the president is confidential ... but it obviously has to do with the peace process," a spokesman for the president's office told Reuters.

The spokesman said he did not have any details as to how Zedillo would deliver the message to the charismatic rebel leader, although several Mexican newspapers on Saturday said it would be delivered via a legislative commission called Cocopa that has been trying to coax the rebels back to peace talks.

Zedillo in the past steered clear of getting directly involved in the peace process with the rebels, who launched a brief rebellion in early 1994 and have been in on-and-off talks ever since.

Rebels officially broke off talks in September but have been meeting with Cocopa members for more than a week to try to draw up a bill on Indian rights to be written into the constitution before Dec. 15. Consensus on the bill was seen as a key step in restarting talks.

Marcos said Friday the government was demanding last-minute changes in the bill and declared the 20-month peace process in crisis.
