<p>U.S. Vice President Al Gore on Saturday told Latin Americans to stop looking to their governments to clean up rivers, lands and skies, saying organised citizens and the private sector should help preserve the environment.</p>
<p>&quot;Governments alone cannot provide all the solutions,&quot; Gore told a one-day regional summit on sustainable economic development in this eastern Bolivian city.</p>
<p>&quot;The private sector, non-governmental organisations and international financial institutions have increasingly important roles to play.&quot;</p>
<p>Sustainable development, a principle approved by world leaders at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, means pursuing economic growth without harming the environment.</p>
<p>Gore's plane was diverted to Cochabamba, 150 miles (250 km) west of Santa Cruz due to heavy rains in this tropical city. The vice president arrived four hours behind schedule in Santa Cruz, causing the summit to open 90 minutes late.</p>
<p>In his speech, Gore, who has had a longstanding interest in environmental issues, called for urgent, concerted action so that all Latin Americans, 40 percent of whom live under the poverty line, have access to clean water and electricity.</p>
<p>More than one third of Latin Americans lack electricity and many to clean drinking water.</p>
<p>&quot;We are here today for one reason and one reason alone: to do all we humanly can to improve the wellbeing of our children and grand children,&quot; Gore said. &quot;To ensure that they live in a world of peace, a world with fresh air and clean water.&quot;</p>
<p>The meeting's host, Bolivia's President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, proposed that North, Central and South American nations draft agreements on sustainable development for 2005, when they hope to set up a pan-American free trade zone.</p>
<p>&quot;The real possibility to achieve sustainable development is ... here, provided we are ready to work without trepidation on an all-encompassing treaty,&quot; the Bolivian leader said.</p>
<p>But despite all the calls to work together and the optimistic tone of the speeches, both organisational problems and differences over the agenda hunted the conference, leading several leaders to cancel their visit and others to cut it short, often using only bland excuses.</p>
<p>Only 14 heads of state showed up for the conference, forcing organisers to shorten the meeting to one day from the original two. Bolivia had announced last Monday that 24 leaders were expected to attend.</p>
<p>Officials have said off-the-record that the main problem was a lack on consensus on the scope of the meeting, with Washington insisting on focusing on the environment and several Latin American nations arguing that poverty and economic development should take precedence.</p>
<p>&quot;Many (heads of state) did not show up because they did not know what they would be discussing,&quot; an official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The result was a long, &quot;painfully negotiated&quot; meeting agenda that lacked a clear focus, said one official who took part in the eight-month-long discussions to set it up.</p>
<p>Indeed, the final declaration's draft was a bulky, 50-page compilation of a wide range of environmental, economic and social problems affecting the region and calling for concrete steps to solve them.</p>
<p>In a separate, four-day meeting last week in La Paz, 300 miles (500 km) west of Santa Cruz, first ladies from the Americas, including U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, demanded a bigger slice of power for women in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;We urge governments to implement public policies aimed at promoting equal access of women to decision-making processes,&quot; they said in a declaration. Mrs. Clinton told her peers they should foster education, especially for girls, if the region's fledgling democracies and market economies were to develop.</p>
