SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador 1996-12-07

Two children were killed and another injured early on Saturday when unknown assailants detonated a grenade in northern El Salvador, Red Cross officials said.

Iris Alvarenga, 11, and Elmer Flores, nine, were killed after a fragmentation grenade exploded near them in the town of La Palma, some 50 miles (80 km) of the capital San Salvador.

An 11-year-old girl, Celia Villeda, and four others were injured in the blast, according to a Red Cross spokesman in San Salvador.

Alvarenga and Flores were standing next to an unidentified woman who was washing police uniforms near a river and may have been the target of the attack, the Red Cross official said. The woman was unharmed.
