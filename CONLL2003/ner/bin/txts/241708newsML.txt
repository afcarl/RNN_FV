SANTIAGO, Chile 1996-12-07

Chilean novelist Jose Donoso, whose books mixed surrealism with black comedy, died on Saturday in Santiago at the age of 71, his publishers said.

Donoso had been ill for at least two years, according to a spokesman for the publishers, Alfaguara.

Donoso, whose novels included "Coronacion" (Coronation) and "El obsceno pajaro de la noche" (The Obscene Bird of the Night), died at his home in the Chilean capital, surrounded by friends and family members, the spokesman said.

Donoso was Chile's best-known novelist and one of the leading writers of the Latin American literary boom that began in the 1960s.
