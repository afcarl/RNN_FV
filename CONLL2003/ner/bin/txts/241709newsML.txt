Peru frees jailed general after amnesty.

The Peruvian military released outspoken retired general Rodolfo Robles from jail on Saturday in obedience to an amnesty from President Alberto Fujimori.

Robles, detained 11 days ago for "insubordination" after linking an army "death-squad" to a bomb attack on a radio station, was greeted by scores of chanting supporters as he left the military barracks.

"Friends and comrades, I am very happy to be free. I have always been free in spirit, and now I am physically free," he said, making a victory sign and waving a Peruvian flag.

The release ended a tense controversy that threatened to upset the delicate balance of power between Fujimori's government and the powerful armed forces.

Robles' detention provoked a tide of public protest that forced Fujimori to confront the military with a hastily-proposed bill overruling the arrest with an amnesty. Congress unanimously approved the bill on Thursday, mandating Robles' release on Saturday.

Speaking outside the former Spanish fort where he was held in Lima's neighbouring port of Callao, Robles welcomed his release and thanked supporters, but said he rejected the amnesty in principle.

"At no time have I committed a crime. I am not in agreement with a pardon or an amnesty. This has been a political solution, not a moral one," said the general, who was adopted as a prisoner of consicience by international rights group Amnesty International.

In what witnesses described as more like a kidnapping, the military arrested Robles in a Lima street last week in response to his accusation of a "death-squad" bombing.

Robles has frequently spoken out against Peru's military, which regards him as a dangerous maverick. After claiming an army "death squad" killed 10 students and a university teacher in 1992, he went into exile in Argentina to avoid trial but later returned to Peru when the government gave him an amnesty.

Fujimori's support for Robles was widely applauded within Peru and is expected to help him in the polls, where the president's traditionally high approval rating has slipped to around 50 percent in recent months.

"The president's initiative has undoubtedly served to strengthen the state of law in Peru," said Robles' former lawyer, Heriberto Benitez, who was banned from defending the general on grounds of insulting the military court.
