Brazil minister warns of cellular cartel threat.

SAO PAULO 1996-12-07

Brazil's Communications Minister Sergio Motta has warned that foreign-led groups preparing to bid on cellular B Band frequency concessions may be trying to form a cartel to divide up the 10 service areas, local newspapers said.

"Members of the consortia met in Sao Paulo to study dividing the B Band areas amongst themselves," Motta was quoted as saying by Jornal do Brasil.

The press quoted Motta, who spoke on Friday at a business lunch, as saying that it was to avoid just such possible concession rigging that Brasilia opted not to release all B Band bid specifications at once at the end of December.

An official from one group ackowledged he was invited two weeks ago to a meeting to discuss "interconnections" between concession areas but did not go, but others dismissed Motta's statements, the papers said.

"The minister is creating ghosts out of shadows," Luiz Garcia, head of mining group ABC Algar, was quoted by Folha de S. Paulo as saying.

Some 20 groups, including many of the largest telecoms firms in the world, are eyeing Brazil's B Band. Tender documents for the concessions are slated to be released in the coming weeks, officials said.
