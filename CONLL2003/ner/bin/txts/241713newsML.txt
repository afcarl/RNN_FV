NZ Labour backs coalition plan, waits for Peters.

New Zealand Labour MPs, keen for a share of power after six years in opposition, on Saturday backed their leader over a proposed coalition deal with nationalist New Zealand First.

The terms of the agreement remain secret. NZ First, which holds the balance of power, has yet to choose between Labour and the caretaker National Party government as its preferred coalition partner.

Politicians are scrambling to complete a deal before parliament meets on Thursday, ending two months of uncertainty since a general election on October 12.

Labour leader Helen Clark said she had briefed her members of parliament on the terms of a deal with NZ First, and won their backing.

"They've given us unanimous support on the direction and approach we've taken, and we're now waiting to hear from New Zealand First," she told reporters.

As weeks of negotiations neared their climax, caretaker Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said he was pulling out of next week's conference of the World Trade Organisation in Singapore.

"Commitments in Wellington as a member of the coalition talks team and the lead-up to the opening of parliament next week necessitate my staying in New Zealand," McKinnon said. Caretaker farm minister Lockwood Smith will go instead.

Pressure is mounting on NZ First and its charismatic Maori leader Winston Peters to name its coalition partner and resolve the stalemate.

NZ First is seen as closer to Labour on social policy and Maori issues, but newspapers speculate that the conservative National Party, in power since 1990, may be willing to offer major concessions to remain in office.

Caretaker Prime Minister Jim Bolger will not confirm reports he is willing to give up planned tax cuts, a major plank of his election campaign, in order to address NZ First's spending priorities.

NZ First's policies include limiting foreign investment in strategic New Zealand assets to less than 25 percent, and making everyone save a portion of income in a compulsory pension scheme.

Bolger was due to meet Peters on Sunday, with NZ First MPs gathering the same day to consider the choice between National and Labour.
