Burma's military government said most of the 264 protestors held at a demonstration near the University of Yangon (Rangoon) on Saturday had been released.

"Most of those held in the 3 a.m. operation have been released by this early afternoon and I would expect all of them to be freed by the end of the day," a spokesman told Reuters. He did not give details of how many people had been freed.

He said the government was still checking the identities of some of those held at the Kyatkasan ground, a former racetrack, in central Rangoon.

Soldiers and riot police rounded up students and other protestors after using water cannon and batons to end an 11-hour street protest in the capital just before dawn, witnesses said.

The crackdown began when troops and police rushed a group of students sitting at a junction near the University of Yangon (Rangoon) who had refused to heed orders to disperse.

On Monday, up to 2,000 students from Yangon University and Yangon Institute of Technology held the biggest street demonstration seen in Rangoon since mass pro-democracy uprisings in September 1988.

The 1988 uprising was crushed by the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), leaving many dead and thousands more in jail.

Before troops and police moved in early on Saturday, the students were warned to disperse so authorities could sort out the "political agitators" from the protesters, witnesses said.

Fire engines used water cannon for about 20 minutes and police chased some students trying to flee, they added.

Some protestors were struck with batons as they were put into vehicles and taken away.

"We saw students at the centre of the junction being forced by water cannon to crouch face-down to the ground. Some were hit by flying stones," said one witness near the scene.

The students were demanding rights to organise independent unions on campus and as well as freedom for about 80 jailed student leaders.

There has been no official comment on the group of 80 students or when they were being held.

On Friday, the students said the protests were non-political and they had no contact with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi or her National League for Democracy (NLD) party.

Rangoon was calm on Saturday with most residents unaware of the pre-dawn crackdown. But truckloads of armed security forces kept watch at several intersections near the university and the Yangon Institute of Technology about six km (four miles) away.

For a time, witnesses said, a government helicopter hovered over the troubled Institute, which was shut for nearly two years following the 1988 uprisings.

Police have blocked roads leading to Suu Kyi's home since Tuesday, reflecting government fears that she might be drawn into the protests. Suu Kyi and the student leaders have denied any links with one another, but her supporters said there was a moral bridge between the two parties.

The students said their protests had been triggered by what they called unfair police handling of a student brawl near a restaurant in October.
