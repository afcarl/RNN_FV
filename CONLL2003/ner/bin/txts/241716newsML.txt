Japan and United States said on Saturday they would continue senior-level discussions aimed at ending a dispute over how Japan should open up its $400 billion insurance market to foreign companies.

After two days of high-level talks between Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, a Japanese official said substantial progress had been made but more work needed to be done.

"It is true that we've made substantial progress, but we weren't able to reach a final agreement. Our big differences are still there," said the official from Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF), who spoke on condition he not be identified.

The official said both sides had put forward new proposals on ending the dispute, but declined to comment on details.

"We will study the proposals further and we welcome the fact that these proposals have at last been made," Barshefsky told a news conference at the U.S. embassy in Tokyo.

"The proposals are sufficiently interesting to us that (USTR) Ambassador (Ira) Shapiro will remain in Tokyo to discuss them further," she said.

The two countries have set a December 15 deadline -- the latest in a series -- to settle the row. Mitsuzuka said he believed this deadline would be the last.

The disagreement centres on U.S. charges that Japan is planning to renege on a 1994 trade agreement on the deregulation of its lucrative insurance market.

Washington has argued that the agreement calls for Tokyo to deregulate the huge primary life and casualty insurance sector, which is dominated by Japanese companies, before unleashing competition in the tiny specialty insurance market.

The niche market is the only one in which foreign insurance groups have a firm foothold.

The talks will be held on Sunday and Monday between Eisuke Sakakibara, director general of MOF's International Finance Bureau and senior USTR negotiator Shapiro.

"No outcome is ever assured but I believe both sides have a will to work together," Barshefsky said in brief remarks to reporters at the end of ministerial talks in the afternoon.

"We have urged them to redouble their efforts to attempt to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution of the issues," she said.

Barshefsky, who was to leave Tokyo later on Saturday to attend a meeting of the World Trade Organisation in Singapore, said she may stop by Tokyo on December 14 for final talks ahead of the deadline if circumstances warrant.

The MOF official said Japan has made proposals to liberalise its primary life and casualty insurance sector, based on the spirit of the "Big Bang" financial reforms to implement substantial deregulation by 2001, mapped out by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashim reforms will liberalise insurance premium rates and allow banks, securities houses and insurance companies to enter each other's now-protected areas.

The U.S. also made proposals which were in line with what the Japanese side was requesting, he added.

U.S. President Bill Clinton has described the dispute as the biggest trade problem between the two countries. U.S. officials have declined to say what action they would take if the issue was not resolved, but said they were keeping all options open.
