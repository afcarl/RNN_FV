<p>South Korea's Defence Ministry has filed the first ever criminal complaint against a Korean trust company for allegedly investing a military pension fund in stocks instead of bonds as it said was promised.</p>
<p>An official for the Seoul Prosecutor's office said the complaint involved Daehan Investment Trust Co Ltd, the country's largest investment trust in terms of capital and the second largest in terms of deposits.</p>
<p>A Daehan spokesman denied any wrongdoing and said the Defence Ministry knew the 40.1 billion won ($48.3 million) it was given to invest would be used on the stock market.</p>
<p>&quot;The defence ministry brought a complaint against three senior officials at Daehan Investment Trust for swindling which inflicted a loss in its pension fund by improper management,&quot; the prosecution official told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We will start our investigation by questioning the parties involved and examining evidence,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The complaint, which alleges fraud, claimed that when the pension fund was deposited with the firm on January 16, 1995, the Daehan employees issued a memorandum to the ministry guaranteeing a minimum annual fixed rate of return of 15.7 percent to 20 percent through investment in bonds.</p>
<p>But instead of putting the money in bonds, Daehan invested it in shares resulting in a huge loss in return as the country's stock market lost value, the complaint alleges.</p>
<p>&quot;We made it clear to Daehan that we wanted the pension fund invested in bonds,&quot; a spokesman for the Defence Ministry told Reuters. &quot;But they used the fund for stock investment without our acknowledgement.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the ministry filed a civil suit last April to recover money it believed it was owed and was now making a criminal complaint in an attempt to hasten legal proceedings.</p>
<p>In the civil suit, the defence ministry demanded Daehan pay the ministry 5.5 billion won due to it under a promise by the firm to get a minimum 15.7 percent return on investment.</p>
<p>The ministry spokesman said legal proceedings in the civil court have long been prolonged deliberately by Daehan.</p>
<p>The Daehan spokesman said the defence ministry had no case.</p>
<p>&quot;The military was well aware that the fund was for stock investment,&quot; he said. &quot;It even says so on the bank book.&quot;</p>
<p>Daehan said in a statement the memorandum issued to the ministry at the time was &quot;invalid&quot; and had &quot;no legal binding&quot; because regulations of investment trusts banned such activity.</p>
<p>&quot;The fund manager at the ministry wanted a memorandum from us to hand it to his boss,&quot; the Daehan spokesman said. &quot;At the time we thought we could guarantee a minimum of 15.7 percent interest return on investment, and we put that down. Neither parties expected the stock market to fall.&quot;</p>
<p>The South Korean stock market fell 9.4 percent in the year between when the pension fund money money was given to Daehan and last January 17 when it was withdrawn from the firm.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been civil complaints against investment trusts but this marks the first time for a criminal complaint in Korea,&quot; the Daehan spokesman said. &quot;We'll follow whatever the legal outcome.&quot;</p>
<p>The Defence Ministry official said there were three types of pension funds for soldiers, one paid after 20 years military service and the others for injury and death during service.</p>
<p>The official would not say which pension fund was involved.</p>
<p>South Korea has permanent armed forces numbering about 655,000 soldiers.</p>
