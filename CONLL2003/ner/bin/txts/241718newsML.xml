<p>Burmese soldiers and riot police rounded up 263 students and sympathisers after using water canons and batons to end an 11-hour street protest in the capital Rangoon early on Saturday, witnesses said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have been taken for identification to Kyatkasan ground (a former horse racing course) and they will later be released...today or tomorrow,&quot; a government spokesman said.</p>
<p>The crackdown began around 3:00 a.m. (2030 GMT Friday) when troops and police rushed a gathering of around 120 protesting students who had been sitting at the centre of a junction near the University of Yangon (Rangoon).</p>
<p>The student street protest was the second major one this week in the capital.</p>
<p>On Monday, up to 2,000 students from Yangon University and Yangon Institute of Technology held the biggest street demonstration seen in Rangoon since mass pro-democracy uprisings were crushed in 1988, leaving thousands dead or in jail.</p>
<p>Before troops and police moved in early on Saturday, the students were warned to disperse so authorities could sort out the &quot;political agitators&quot; from the protesters, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Fire engines shot water cannons for about 20 minutes and police chased some students who tried to escape, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Some students were clubbed and injured by batons as they were put into three vehicles believed to be heading for the maximum security Insein Prison in suburban Rangoon, they added.</p>
<p>A number of onlookers sided with the students and stoned the troops. A Japanese journalist was beaten in the melee, the witnesses said. Some students, especially those holding university flags, were stoned and injured by security forces.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw students at the centre of the junction being forced by water cannons to crouch face-down to the ground. Some were hit by flying stones,&quot; said one witness near the scene.</p>
<p>The students, whose numbers had swelled to around 500 late on Friday before dwindling to around 120 early on Saturday, were demanding rights to organise independent unions on campuses and free about 80 jailed student leaders. There has been no official comment on the group of 80 students or when they were detained.</p>
<p>On Friday, the students said the protests were non-political and they had no contact with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi or her National League for Democracy (NLD) party.</p>
<p>The spokesman for the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) told Reuters the authorities had used &quot;soft measures&quot; to break up the protest, the second this week.</p>
<p>Despite the detentions, Rangoon appeared calm on Saturday with most residents waking up unaware of the pre-dawn crackdown.</p>
<p>But truckloads of armed security forces and fire engines kept watch at several intersections near the university and the Yangon Institute of Technology about six km (four miles) away.</p>
<p>Witnesses said a government helicopter at one point kept vigil over the troubled Institute, which was shut for nearly two years following the 1988 uprisings.</p>
<p>Monday's demonstration ended at dawn on Tuesday, when police detained over 600 protesters who refused to disperse in central Rangoon. They were later released.</p>
<p>Police have blocked roads leading to Suu Kyi's home since Tuesday, reflecting fears in the government she may be drawn into the protests. Suu Kyi and the student leaders have denied any links to each other, but her supporters said there was a moral tie between the two parties.</p>
<p>The students said the protests on Monday and Friday had been triggered by what they called unfair police handling of student brawl near a restaurant in October.</p>
