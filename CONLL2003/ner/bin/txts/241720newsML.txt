Burmese troops and riot police rounded up scores of university students after firing water cannons to break up an 11-hour street protest in the capital Rangoon early on Saturday, witnesses said.

They said troops and police rounded up about 120 students sitting at the centre of the junction near the University of Yangon (Rangoon) after using water cannons from fire engines to subdue the protest at about 3 a.m. (2030 GMT Friday).

They said some students were clubbed and injured by batons while they were put into three vehicles believed to be heading for the maximum security Insein Prison in suburban Rangoon.

The student street protest was the second major one this week in the capital.

On Monday, up to 2,000 students from Yangon University and the troubled Yangon Institute of Technology held the biggest street demonstration seen in Rangoon since mass pro-democracy uprisings were crushed in 1988.

About 15 of those detained at the junction, which lies on the fringes of the city, were female students, witnesses said.

They said that before troops and police moved in, the students were warned to disperse peacefully so the authorities could sort out the "political agitators" from the protesters.

Fire engines shot water cannons for about 20 minutes and police chased some students who tried to escape, witnesses said.

The protesting students were demanding rights to organise independent unions on campuses and the release of about 80 student leaders currently in jail.

They were part of about 500 students who earlier started demonstrating at the intersection on late Friday afternoon.

On Friday, the students said the protests were non-political and they had no contact with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi or her National League for Democracy (NLD) party.

Earlier, a spokesman for Burma's ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) had said no action would be taken against the students.

The students said the protests on Monday and Friday had been triggered by what they called unfair police handling of student brawl near a restaurant in October.

They said the government failed to respond to their demands.

The students had also sought a government pledge that the institute would not be closed because of the protests.

It was shut for nearly two years shortly after the 1988 demonstrations.

Key NLD officials and Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate, have denied any link with the students. But they have said there is a "moral link" between them in that they were against police brutality and injustice.

On Friday, the road leading to Suu Kyi's lakeside residence in central Rangoon remained closed by police.
