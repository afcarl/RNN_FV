BEIJING 1996-12-07

Tibet has held elections to local lawmaking bodies, with ethnic Tibetans and other minority groups accounting for almost all the new delegates, the Xinhua news agency said on Saturday.

Ninety-nine percent of the new delegates are Tibetans or people from other ethnic minorities, while 20.3 per cent are women, Xinhua said.

Han Chinese are still the most powerful officials in the Himalayan region.

Xinhua said nearly 1.2 million people from 915 towns across Tibet voted for more than 31,500 delegates in elections to people's congresses at the level of townships.

It did not say when the elections were held.

"Local authorities said that compared with the last election in 1993, the number of voters is up by 0.5 per cent, which indicates that people's enthusiasm for democratic elections is on the rise," Xinhua said. It gave no further details.
