<p>International trade union leaders told World Trade Organisation (WTO) chairman Yeo Cheow Tong on Saturday the credibility of the WTO was at stake over trade and workers rights.</p>
<p>&quot;Without universal respect for basic human rights at work, which enable working men and women to struggle for a better deal, the multilateral trading system constructed by the WTO will become unenforceable,&quot; a statement from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) said.</p>
<p>&quot;The credibility of the WTO is at stake in Singapore,&quot; said the ICFTU statement presented to Yeo on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>Yeo, who is also Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry, was meeting ICFTU leaders who are holding a special conference on international labour standards in Singapore.</p>
<p>The three-day trade union conference, which ends on Sunday, hopes to push labour issues onto the WTO agenda.</p>
<p>Renato Ruggiero, director general of the WTO, Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative and Sir Leon Brittan, the senior representative of the European Commission, are all expected to attend the final day of the ICFTU meeting.</p>
<p>The ICFTU wants to persuade ministers to create a working party to report on how the WTO and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) can further the international observance of basic labour standards in trade agreements.</p>
<p>&quot;If the WTO is to strengthen its authority as the world's promoter of free and fair trade, it must ensure that basic human and trade union rights are not repressed in pursuit of competitive advantage,&quot; said the statement.</p>
<p>The WTO has resisted linking trade and labour standards on its official agenda and last week withdrew an invititation to ILO director general Michel Hansenne to speak at next week's ministerial meeting.</p>
<p>It was expected that Hansenne would have spoken about linking trade and labour standards.</p>
