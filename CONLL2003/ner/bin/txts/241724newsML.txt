BEIJING 1996-12-07

China's first solar-powered car has passed its appraisal by the cabinet's State Science and Technology Commission and Ministry of Internal Trade, the Xinhua news agency said on Saturday.

The car -- the China Number One -- was produced in the eastern province of Jiangsu, and is the brainchild of Yang Tingzhu, a scientist with the Hailiang Solar Energy Institute of Jiangsu Province, it said.

The car can travel 202 km (126 miles) on one charge, at maximum speeds of 80 km (50 miles) per hour and an average speed of about 60 km (37 miles) per hour, the agency said.

Experts say such solar vehicles could be used as taxis in major cities, Xinhua said.
