Taiwan's foreign minister is on a confidential mission to forge new ties in Africa following Pretoria's recent decision to abandon Taipei in favour of diplomatic relations with Beijing, officials said on Saturday.

Foreign minister John Chang, in South Africa on an apparently fruitless bid to reverse Pretoria's decision, failed to appear at a scheduled dinner with Taiwanese reporters on Friday in Johannesburg.

Vice-foreign minister Cheng Chien-jen said Chang had left South Africa and was visiting other countries, but he declined to give more details.

"Minister Chang is going out, striving to strengthen our relations with other countries," Cheng said on Taiwan state television.

"They (Chinese communists) keep on tightening the noose. We cannot just sit here. We must continue to go out," he said.

State television said the minister was probably visiting central or southern African nations and possibly European countries to discuss diplomatic ties.

Cheng declined to reveal which countries Chang was visiting.

"Where is (Chang) now? It's hard for me to say," Cheng said.

Chang had been slated to return to Taipei on Sunday night, but state television said he might not be able to return home as scheduled because of the mission.

South African President Nelson Mandela announced on November 27 that Pretoria, the biggest of Taiwan's only 30 diplomatic allies, would switch ties to Beijing in 1997. The price of relations with Beijing would be abandonment of ties with Taiwan which China regards as a rebel province.

China and Taiwan have gone separate ways since a civil war in 1949 which brought communists to power on the mainland.

Chang met President Mandela on Wednesday, but the South African president said he would stick by his "agonising decision" to sever ties with Taiwan.

Chang announced in Pretoria on Thursday that Taipei would recall its ambassador to South Africa and immediately suspend all aid projects and treaties in protest at the breaking of diplomatic ties.
