Hectic Friday trade gives Simex 1996 volume record.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-07

Turbulence on Asia's financial markets on Friday helped the Singapore International Monetary Exchange Ltd (SIMEX) set a record high for traded volume in 1996, it said on Saturday.

Hectic trading of 252,351 contracts was 17 percent above the previous best for the year and just shy of the all-time record 255,927 volume set on May 18 1994, Simex said in a statement.

"The hectic trading resulted in part from comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, hinting at concerns about overpriced U.S. stocks and sparking off fears about possible interest rate hikes," said the Simex statement.

Trades of 248,488 futures and 3,863 options contracts were done on Friday, led by the leading Eurodollar three-month interest rate futures contract. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average Index futures contract added 51,373 contracts to the total.

Simex said the volatility of Friday's market proved the role its Eurodollar, Euroyen and Nikkei 225 contracts can play in effective risk management.

It said the high volumes also successfully tested the Exchange's new trade matching system, implemented in September, to handle large trading volumes in active market conditions. --Singapore newsroom (65 8703011)
