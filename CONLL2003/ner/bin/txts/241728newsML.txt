TOKYO 1996-12-07

Japan and Russia have agreed on a 1997 quota of 100,000 tonnes each for fish caught in each other's 200 mile exclusive economic zones, the same as 1996 levels, Japanese officials said on Saturday.

Wrapping up two weeks of talks in Tokyo, Russia also agreed to allow Japan to catch an additional 9,000 tonnes in exchange for payment of 400 million yen ($3.53 million), Fisheries Agency officials said.

The two countries will also continue measures allowing fishing boats to call at specified ports in each country to replenish supplies and rest crews, the officials said.

Russian patrol boats have over the past year fired on Japanese boats for alleged illegal fishing in waters near the Kurile islands, a disputed chain of islands north of Japan which the Soviet Union seized at the end of World War Two. ($=113 yen)
