BANGKOK 1996-12-07

Bank of Thailand governor Rerngchai Marakanond said on Saturday the current account deficit this year will be at around 8.2-8.3 percent of the gross domestic product.

"Sluggish exports make the current account deficit and trade deficit remain worrysome. The current accound deficit is expected to be around 8.2-8.3 percent of GDP," Rerngchai told a seminar.

The current account deficit was at 8.1 percent of GDP in 1995.

The Bank of Thailand said late last month exports in the first nine months of 1996 rose only 0.9 percent, compared to more than 20 percent in the same period last year.

Rerngchai said he also worries about rising interest payments on foreign debts which contributed to the widening current account deficit in September.

The current account deficit in September widened to 30.5 billion baht ($1.22 billion) from 29.3 billion in August.

Thailand's current foreign debt amounts to about $87 billlion, accounting for 50 percent of GDP, the governor said.

"However external debt remains under the central bank's control. And short-term foreign borrowings showed a declining trend," Rerngchai said.

Moody's Investors Service in September downdraded Thailand's short-term sovereign ceiling ratings due to the country's high level of short-term external debt.

Rerngchai said foreign inflows over the past four months slowed to $700 million per month compared with $1.7 billion in the first first six months.

"Foreign inflows into Thailand will continue to slow further for the rest of this year," he said. --Bangkok newsroom (662) 652-0642
