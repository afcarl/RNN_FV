China yuan business for foreign banks by year-end.

SHANGHAI 1996-12-07

The names of foreign banks to be approved to handle Chinese yuan business will be announced before the end of the year, Shanghai's vice-mayor Zhao Qizheng said on Saturday.

Zhao told a seminar on Sino-U.S. business relations that Shanghai city hoped that as many banks as possible would be granted permission to conduct business in the local Chinese currency.

"We hope for more, but the power of approval rests not with us but with the People's Bank of China," he said.

Zhao said he could not confirm media reports that several banks had already been chosen to do yuan business, saying that "anything can change at the last minute."

"By the end of this year, we will announce a list of the banks," he added.

The official Shanghai Star newspaper reported on Tuesday that three foreign banks had been given approval to do local currency business -- Citibank, Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank and Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.

A spokesman for the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, declined to comment on the newspaper report.

Up to now, foreign banks with branches in China have been restricted to doing foreign currency business only, with the Chinese banks retaining a monopoly on the huge local currency loan and deposit market.

The Star said the banks would be allowed to handle local currency deposits, loans and other business, adding that the business will be opened to more foreign banks from early next year.
