<p>Three separatist rebels from Indonesia's troubled territory of East Timor were caught last week but will not go on trial, the official Antara news agency said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Colonel Mahidin Simbolon, East Timor's military commander, was quoted as saying three members of a &quot;security disturbance movement&quot; (GPK) had been captured but would not be charged under Indonesian law.</p>
<p>GPK is a term used in Indonesia to describe separatist rebels operating in East Timor, as well as Irian Jaya on the Western half of Papua New Guinea island and in Aceh on the northern tip of Sumatra.</p>
<p>Simbolon said those arrested were not high-ranking rebels and therefore would be granted an amnesty if they agreed to undergo a re-education programme.</p>
<p>&quot;If (Fretelin guerrillas) show regret and want to be educated, then why should we convict them,&quot; Simbolon said.</p>
<p>The Antara report named those arrested as Theofilo de Yesus, Manuel Amaral and Manuel. It gave no other details of the arrest but sources said the three had been shot as they tried to escape from Indonesian troops.</p>
<p>A dwindling band of Fretelin guerillas, now reported to number around 180 in the rugged hills of East Timor, has fought for independence since Indonesia invaded the former Portugese colony more than 20 years ago.</p>
<p>The territory's problems came back in the spotlight in October after Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo and self-exiled separatist Fretelin spokesman Jose Ramos Horta were jointly awarded the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p>Belo left East Timor on Friday to go to Oslo where he is to receive the award in a ceremony next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and absorbed it as its 27th province the following year in a move not recognised by the United Nations, which still considers Portugal the administering power.</p>
