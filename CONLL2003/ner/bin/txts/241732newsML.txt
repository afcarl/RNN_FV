Burma frees most detainees after crackdown.

RANGOON 1996-12-07

Most of the 264 Burmese students and sympathisers held after a protest near the University of Yangon (Rangoon) was broken up earlier on Saturday have been released, a  government spokesman said.

"Most of those held in the 3.00 a.m. operation have been released by this early afternoon and I would expect all of them to be freed by the end of the day," the spokesman told Reuters. He did not give details of how many people had been freed.  

He said the government was still checking the identities of those held at the Kyatkasan ground (a former horse racing course) in central Rangoon.

The students and sympathisers who were held were part of a larger group of about 500 that had gathered outside the university on Friday to protest against the continued detention of 80 student leaders.

They had also demanded that they be allowed to form student unions on campuses.

Earlier on Saturday, government officials failed to persuade the protesters to leave. Soldiers and riot police charged the protesters and detained them.
