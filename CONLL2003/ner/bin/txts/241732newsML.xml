<p>Most of the 264 Burmese students and sympathisers held after a protest near the University of Yangon (Rangoon) was broken up earlier on Saturday have been released, a  government spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of those held in the 3.00 a.m. operation have been released by this early afternoon and I would expect all of them to be freed by the end of the day,&quot; the spokesman told Reuters. He did not give details of how many people had been freed.  </p>
<p>He said the government was still checking the identities of those held at the Kyatkasan ground (a former horse racing course) in central Rangoon.</p>
<p>The students and sympathisers who were held were part of a larger group of about 500 that had gathered outside the university on Friday to protest against the continued detention of 80 student leaders.</p>
<p>They had also demanded that they be allowed to form student unions on campuses.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, government officials failed to persuade the protesters to leave. Soldiers and riot police charged the protesters and detained them.</p>
