Vietnam tightens grip on private, foreign business.

HANOI 1996-12-07

Vietnam's elite politburo has issued instructions for the establishing and strengthening of a nationwide network of Communist Party "cells" and organisations in foreign and private firms, state media said on Saturday.

The official Vietnam News agency (VNA) and the Nhan Dan daily carried details of the politburo order which calls for party cells and organisations to be set up in all private businesses and enterprises involving foreign capital.

The reports said the measure was aimed at ensuring the correct development of the economy.

"Their operation has contributed to the industrialisation and modernisation process of the country," VNA said. "...but it also revealed many weak points and negative phenomena."

The instruction said party members should increase their awareness of state economic policy and accelerate efforts to form party cells, unions and other organisations inside businesses.

The process will start in large- and medium-scale firms and then be applied to small businesses, while local Party committees will be tasked with ensuring the cells operate in accordance with politburo regulations.

Vietnam introduced market-oriented reforms in the late 1980s, unleashing economic takeoff and dramatic social changes.

Hanoi says it is committed to maintaining the reform policy, but conservatives argue that economic and social liberalisation could loosen the party's grip on power.

Over the past year Hanoi has moved to bolster the leading role of the party in Vietnamese society through a series of campaigns and decrees.

A prime government target of these have been concerns over "peaceful evolution" -- a term used by Hanoi to mean backdoor subversion by groups seeking to gradually foment discontent through cultural and economic means.

Senior Vietnamese officials say the party cell system will serve to enhance communication between government and business.
