HK to join WTO pact to raise competitiveness.

HONG KONG 1996-12-07

Hong Kong has said it will soon participate in a World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement that should help increase the competitiveness of its domestic goods, the government said in a statement on Saturday.

The announcement follows unanimous agreement by signatories of the pact on December 5 to accept Hong Kong into the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, the statement said.

Under the agreement, each signatory is obliged to treat products, services and suppliers of other signatories in public procurement as if they were of domestic origin, it said.

The agreement stipulates detailed rules on tendering, technical specifications and challenge procedures, aiming to ensure foreign products and suppliers compete on a level playing field with domestic products and suppliers for contracts.

"We are pleased that Hong Kong can become a party to the agreement. This will provide greater opportunities for our exporters and suppliers to tap into overseas government procurement markets," a government spokesman said.

The agreement groups Canada, the twelve member states of the European Community, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Aruba island off Venezuela, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and the United States.
