The United States welcomed Japan's proposals to deregulate the primary sector of its insurance market, acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said on Saturday.

"We will study the proposals further and we welcome the fact that these proposals have at last been made," Barshefsky told a news conference at the U.S. embassy in Tokyo.

"The proposals are sufficiently interesting to us that (USTR) Ambassador (Ira) Shapiro will remain in Tokyo to discuss them further," she said.

Barshefsky and Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka earlier wrapped up two days of talks aimed a resolving a longstanding dispute over opening Japan's huge insurance market.
