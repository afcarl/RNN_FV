Japan, U.S. put forward insurance talk proposals.

TOKYO 1996-12-07

Japan and the United States put forward new proposals on Saturday aimed at ending an insurance dispute, a senior Japanese Finance Ministry official said.

Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky has agreed to return to Tokyo on December 14 in hopes of reaching a final agreement, the official said. He added that substantial progress had been made in settling the dispute ahead of a December 15 deadline although more work was needed.  

The official said Barshefsky had agreed to come to Tokyo as her counterpart Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka was unable to leave Japan due to his parliamentary schedule. Barshefsky and Mitsuzuka earlier wrapped up two days of talks.

Japan made proposals to liberalise its primary insurance markets based on the "Big Bang" financial reforms to implement substantial deregulation by 2001, mapped out by Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto recently, he said.

The U.S. side also made proposals which were in line with what the Japanese side was requesting, he added.

"It is true that we've made substantial progress, but we weren't able to reach a final agreement. Our big differences are still there," the MOF official said.
