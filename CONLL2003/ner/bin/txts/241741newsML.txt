Malaysia to reproduce U.S. classic car Shelby.

KUALA LUMPUR 1996-12-07

Shelby, the American classic roadster of the 1960s, will be reproduced in Malaysia from next year, Malaysia's national Bernama news agency reported on Saturday.

United Shelby Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian-Japanese-American company, plans to invest 338 million ringgit ($134 million) to revive the car which ceased production in 1969, Mohamed Fisol Ismail, chief executive of the joint-venture, said.

There were a limited number of original Shelbys in the world and demand from enthusiasts was high, Fisol was quoted saying by Bernama.

He said the company hoped to begin exporting five Shelby models -- the Cobra, Daytona Cobra, GT40, GTSV8 and GTSV12 -- to the United States, Japan and Europe from 1998.

"Our research in the United States shows that the demand for the Shelby Cobra exceeds supply, and waiting period for a Cobra can be as long as one year," he said.

The reproduced models will be priced between $90,000 and $100,000, Fisol said.

He said the joint-venture firm will be 51 percent-owned by Malaysians and the balance by individual foreign partners.
