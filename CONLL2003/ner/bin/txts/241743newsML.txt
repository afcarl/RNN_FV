S & P Food Industries goes into property.

KUALA LUMPUR 1996-12-07

S & P Food Industries Bhd has bought Gewaris Sdn Bhd for 19.61 million ringgit to diversify into property development, a company statement said on Saturday.

S & P, an associate of Chase Perdana Bhd, said the acquisition would be financed through internal funds and bank borrowings.

It said Gewaris was developing a 300 million ringgit condominium project called "Fettes Villa" in Malaysia's northern Penang state and this fitted well with its plans to diversify and capture a slice of the local property market.

S & P, a manufacturer of instant coconut milk powder and defatted desiccated coconut, also trades in other food products. ($1 = 2.52 ringgit)
