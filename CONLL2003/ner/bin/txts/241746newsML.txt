U.S.-Japan insurance talks to go on at high level.

TOKYO 1996-12-07

Japan and the United States said on Saturday they will continue to hold talks at a senior level in a bid to end a dispute over Japan's insurance market.

The two sides are facing a December 15 deadline to end the dispute, described as the major hurdle to the two nation's trade relations.

"We will have our respective negotiators continue talks over the next several days," acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told reporters. "We have urged them to redouble their efforts to attempt to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution of the issues," she said.  

The talks will be held between Eisuke Sakakibara, director general of Japan's Ministry of Finance International Finance Bureau and senior USTR negotiator Ira Shapiro.

"No outcome is ever assured but I believe both sides have a will to work together," Barshefsky said in brief remarks to reporters as she left the talks, which began on Friday.

Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said he has asked Barshefsky to return to Tokyo on December 14 to continue their discussions. Barshefsky is to leave Tokyo later Saturday for the World Trade Organisation meeting in Singapore.

Mitsuzuka said he sees the December 15 deadline as the final one to settle the matter.

U.S. President Bill Clinton has described the dispute as the biggest trade problem between the two countries, with threats of U.S. sanctions if a deal is not reached.

The fight centres on U.S. charges that Japan is planning to renege on a 1994 trade agreement on the deregulation of its $400 billion insurance market.

Washington has argued that the agreement calls for Tokyo to deregulate the huge primary life and casualty insurance sector, which is dominated by Japanese companies, before unleashing competition in the tiny speciality insurance market.

The niche market is the only one in which foreign insurance groups have a firm foothold.
