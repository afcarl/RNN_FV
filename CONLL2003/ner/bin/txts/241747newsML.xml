<text>
<p>Asian stock markets could steady or even stage a partial recovery in the coming week, but analysts warned sentiment is likely to remain fragile as the shock waves from the recent sell-off persist.</p>
<p>Shares across the region slumped on Friday after anti-inflation comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan provoked a strong correction.</p>
<p>Hong Kong posted its biggest one-day fall for around nine months, while Tokyo's decline was the heaviest at any time since April, 1995.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones index also fell heavily last Friday, although clawed back early losses of more than 140 points to stand about 55 points down at the close.</p>

<p>TOKYO - &quot;The fall in the US stocks on Friday was much smaller than expected and it seems the Asian markets over-reacted to the Greenspan comments,&quot; said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities Co Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;The Tokyo markets may see a correction to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Nikkei 225 December futures December futures contract settlement level in the coming week,&quot; Ueki said. The CME Nikkei futures closed at 20,495 on Friday, down 405 points.</p>
<p>Brokers added, however, that the after effect of the plunge in Tokyo may be great and it may take a while for the Nikkei average to recover to its level before Friday's fall.</p>
<p>They said that the benchmark would be rangebound between the 20,000 to 20,500 level.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Nikkei 225 closed at 20,276.70, down 667.20 points, or 3.19 percent, from the day before and 743.66 points from its close on November 29.</p>

<p>HONG KONG - A resurgence of interest rate fears is likely to dampen the recent euphoria enjoyed by Hong Kong stocks, leading to some consolidation in the week ahead, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index posted its biggest point drop since March on Friday, falling 388.83 points to 13,102.73 after comments made by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan rattled the market. Over the week, the index fell 2.17 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still expecting a year-end rally but right now I think the market will probably continue to consolidate over the next week or so and then it will resume its uptrend,&quot; said Alex Tang, head of research at Yamaichi International.</p>

<p>BANGKOK - Thai stocks are expected to rebound in the coming week on bargain hunting after heavy falls and on expectations that the government's economic policy will become clearer, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market sentiment should improve next week as the government is scheduled to announce its policy in the parliament on Wednesday. Investors have been waiting for the policy,&quot; said Payuha Boonsiri of Nithipat Capital.</p>
<p>The market will be closed on December 10 for Constitution Day. The SET index closed at 876.89 on Friday, compared to 925.97 last Friday.</p>

<p>DHAKA - The lifting of an earlier ban on bank loans against share certificates failed to correct a persisting fund crisis in the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) during the week. The DSE benchmark index lost 366.2 points at 2,667.1 in the week ending Thursday.</p>

<p>JAKARTA - Shares are likely to gain in the coming week as overeas buyers pick up selected heavyweights after falls on Friday, brokers and analysts said.</p>
<p>Felix D'Souza, head of research of Peregrine Sewu Securities, said he was confident of steady liquidity inflows into the Indonesian equity market for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe a lot of foreign institutional investors plan to increase their weighting in Indonesia,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>An analyst from a Japanese brokerage firm said the impact of Fed Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's remarks would be limited in Jakarta as the country's fundamentals remained strong.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Jakarta Composite Index closed at 628.12 points, against last week's close of 613.01 points.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR - Dealers said they expected shares to rebound on Monday following indications that Wall Street had taken Greenspan's comments more calmly than other centres.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the fall on Friday was overdone,&quot; said Liew Yin Sze, chief economist at J.M. Sassoon and Co.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the KLSE to see a major correction on Monday, although there isn't much to expect for rest of the month with most of the good news having been factored in.&quot;</p>
<p>Week-on-week the Composite Index fell 35.20 points to 1191.32 on Friday.</p>

<p>MANILA - Manila shares are seen moving sideways next week as investors focus on the performance of the Dow Jones.</p>
<p>&quot;Behaviour will be choppy and sideways. This coming week will be one of consolidation or profit-taking with the market watching the Dow,&quot; said Harry Liu, president at Summit Securities Inc.</p>
<p>The Manila share index is seen moving from a low of 3,050 to a high of 3,200 points, traders said.</p>
<p>The main index finished on Friday at 3,139.45 points, 49.29 points, or 1.59 percent, up on the previous Friday's close.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>SEOUL - Seoul shares are expected to continue to slip next week as plenty of negative factors, including fears of labour unrest and an overhang of loans for margin trading, are likely to pressure the sentiment.</p>
<p>They said the index could even test the 650 level this month after falling through 700 last week.</p>
<p>&quot;It may even be too optimistic to think that will be the bottom for this month,&quot; said Choo Hee-yup, a broker at Dongwon Securities.</p>
<p>On Friday, the composite index closed at 6.41 points lower at 699.89, down 4.6 percent, from last Friday's 733.50.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>SINGAPORE - Dealers said the market was likely to rally next week unless U.S. and British markets fell further.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything now depends on what happens on Wall Street and in London,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;If they follow through, we could see lower numbers on Monday. But any way you look at it, I believe this will be a correction and an opportunity to buy.&quot;</p>
<p>Singapore's Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) closed at 2,190.39 on Friday, down 23.78 points on the day but up 2.30 on the week.</p>
<p>The market had earlier fallen 60 points in line with a sharp fall in Hong Kong on interest rate fears.</p>

<p>SYDNEY - The Australian stock market, like most, appears headed for a period of uncertainty after Friday's plunge inspired by comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. The benchmark All Ordinaries index ended at 2,313.9 on Friday, a loss of 74.7 points over the week. The market fell 69.4 points or 2.9 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Monday will be crunch time,&quot; a Melbourne broker said.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>TAIPEI - Taiwan share prices are expected to rebound next week as bargain hunters enter to buy some major-capital shares after the recent downward corrections, brokers said.</p>
<p>Electronics, after recent declines, would also likely help launch a rebound, brokers said.</p>
<p>On Friday, the index ended at 6,806.81 points, compared with 6,765.93 last Friday. A 6,750-7,000 range was seen for next week.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>WELLINGTON - New Zealand shares ended sharply weaker on Friday, with the NZSE-40 capital index tumbling 1.38 percent as markets took fright at remarks by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan.</p>
<p>&quot;It really is a very major selloff...This is anticipating the jitters on Wall Street, a severe case of the jitters, and we don't like those,&quot; said Don Turkington, managing director of Cavill White Securities.</p>
<p>The market was also nervous over politics, with marathon negotiations likely to lead to the formation of a government next week, nearly two months after the October 12 election.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 ended the week at 2,360.92, up from 2,348.42 a week earlier.</p>
