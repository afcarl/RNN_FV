TAIPEI 1996-12-07

Taiwan's imports of gold bars, coins and plate fell 28.77 percent to 6.791 tonnes in November from 9.535 tonnes a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said on Saturday.

The imports were up from 6.064 tonnes in October.  

Gold traders attributed the fall in imports to a seasonal adjustment and a slower market following a period of tension with China in March.

Gold imports hit a record 25.238 tonnes in March, a time of high political and military tension between Taiwan and rival China, a 162.4 percent jump compared with March 1995.

Gold is traditionally considered a safe haven in times of uncertainty. Taiwanese began to buy gold heavily in mid-1995 when China conducted its first missile test near Taiwan to warn the island not to raise its international profile.

The gold stock accumulated since March would be slowly consumed by the end of 1996, gold traders said. Imports would return to normal in 1997, they added.

The ministry said Taiwan's gold exports in November remained modest at 0.366 tonnes, up from 0.304 tonnes in November 1995.
