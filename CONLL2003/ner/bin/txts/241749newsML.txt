China gives HK emigrants grace period to return.

HONG KONG 1996-12-07

Hong Kong emigrants wishing to keep their permanent residency will be given a grace period after the handover next year to return to the territory, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday.

The disclosure, made by Wang Fengchao, a deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under the State Council in Beijing, reverses an earlier understanding that returnees had to be back before July 1, when the territory reverts to Chinese control after more than 150 years of British colonial rule.

Wang was quoted by the newspaper as saying China would follow the international practice of allowing nationals to be away from their country for a certain period of time before taking away their citizenship.

The grace period could be anywhere between six and ten months, Wang said.

Prior to Wang's statement, authorities had feared the impact of a return en masse of Hong Kong emigrants on the eve of the handover wishing to keep their permanent residency status.

Wang was also quoted as saying Hong Kong returnees wishing to be treated as foreign nationals could apply to renounce their Chinese citizenship, but would be treated as Chinese nationals until their applications were approved by Beijing.

But he repeated that Beijing would regard as void British passports obtained under a special nationality scheme and holders of the documents would just be recognised as Chinese citizens.

The issue flared up this week after a senior British envoy said Britain could not provide consular protection in Hong Kong, or on Chinese soil, to Hong Kong holders of British passports under the scheme since China did not recognise it.

Britain offered passports to 50,000 Hong Kong households, a privileged fraction of the territory's 6.3 million people, in a concession to widespread demands for full British citizenship in the wake of Beijing's 1989 Tiananmen crackdown.

Governor Chris Patten moved quickly to assure that Britain would continue to offer assistance if not full consular protection to dual citizens in need.

He also said passports issued to about 135,000 Hong Kong people under the scheme were indistinguishable from any other full British passport.
