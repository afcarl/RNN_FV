Seoul stocks edges lower to 38-month low.

SEOUL 1996-12-07

South Korean stocks continued their downward path on Saturday closing at a 38-month low as the government's plan to sell Korea Telecom shares next week continue to weigh on the market, brokers said.

The composite stock index stood at 696.11 at the close, down 3.78 points from Friday. The level is the lowest since September 21, 1993, when the index closed at 694.66.

"The market is no different from yesterday," said Hur Gyung-shik of Samsung Securities. "The government's Korea Telecom selling is expected to divert institutional investors' interest away from the market."  

The finance ministry said on Friday the government planned to sell 6.92 million shares of Korea Telecom to institutions and corporations in an auction on December 12 and 13.

Brokers said uncertain market prospects, including fears of labour unrest and an overhang of loans for margin trading, kept most investors sidelined.

Volume totalled 14.04 million shares in half trading on Saturday, compared with 23.94 million on Friday. Despite the decline in the index, gainers beat losers 427 to 373.
