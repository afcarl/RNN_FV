<p>A Burmese government spokesman said 263 students and sympathisers had been held after soldiers and riot police broke up a protest near the University of Yangon with water cannons and batons before dawn on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;They have been taken for identification to Kyatkasan ground (a former horse racing course) and they will later be released...today or tomorrow,&quot; he told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Witnesses said the students, who had demanded the release of 80 detained colleagues and asked to be able to set up student unions in campuses since Friday afternoon, were herded away in police trucks by the authorities. There has been no official comment on the group of 80 students or when they were detained.</p>
<p>The spokesman for the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) said the authorities had used &quot;soft measures&quot; to break up the protest, the second this week.</p>
<p>In the earlier student protest, the authorities picked up more than 600 students on Tuesday who had refused to disperse in central Rangoon following a demonstration that began on Monday. They were released after their identities were checked.</p>
<p>The latest student protests have been the worst since September 1988 when the authorities crushed student-led pro-democracy uprisings, leaving thousands dead or in jail.</p>
