Taiwan dollar ends steady in thin trade.

TAIPEI 1996-12-07

The Taiwan dollar continued its recent narrow-range trading on Saturday, closing steady in slow trade amid a lack of market-moving factors, dealers said.

The local dollar ended at T$27.490 against Friday's T$27.491 close. Turnover through dealers was only US$17 million.

"No factors emerged to move the market, and players had little interest stepping in," said one dealer.

"The Taiwan dollar will likely continue the steady, narrow-range trading until the end of this year," he said.

A T$27.48-27.50 range was seen for next week.
