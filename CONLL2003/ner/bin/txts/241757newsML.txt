HK chef kills cat for strength-giving soup.

HONG KONG 1996-12-07

A Hong Kong chef admitted before a magistrate that he slaughtered his friend's cat to make a hotpot soup, a newspaper reported on Saturday.

Lam Yui-tin, 39, told the judge that cat soup would keep him strong during winter, the South China Morning Post reported.

The chef, who was fined HK$2,000 (US$259) for unlawfully slaughtering a domestic cat for food, was stopped only after a neighbour spotted him burning fur off the butchered animal.

But the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Hong Kong slammed the sentence as too lenient and not enough of a deterrent.
