Taiwan stocks end down on overseas market falls.

TAIPEI 1996-12-07

Taiwan share prices closed lower on Saturday, reflecting sharp falls overnight on major world markets over comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, brokers said.

Greenspan had said in a speech in the United States on Thursday night that the Fed should be wary of "irrational exuberance" in stock and asset markets because this could hurt the U.S. economy.

Stock and money market traders worldwide feared Greenspan was suggesting the possibility of higher interest rates.

The index ended down 27.20 points, or 0.40 percent, at 6,779.61. Turnover was a modest T$37.28 billion.  

"Investors simply were taking the chance to take profits after the index failed to break resistance at 7,000 points in recent sessions," said Allen Huang, a trading manager at National Securities.

Electronics continued to fall despite an expected rebound after recent heavy profit-taking, with Acer down T$1.5 to T$50.

Financials and plastics were also weak, but automobile, steel and cement shares rebounded.  

Investors were worried that the central bank might tighten monetary policy after the market's November rally and also possible interest rate hikes by the United States.

But after the market closed, central bank vice governor Hsu Chia-tung told journalists that the bank had no plans to adjust its stable-to-loose monetary policy despite a recent surge in stock prices driven in part by loose liquidity.

Brokers said they expected the profit-taking pressue to slow down next week, with a small rebound likely.

A 6,700-6,900 range was seen for next week. -- James Peng (5080815)
