<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan stocks end down on overseas market falls.</title>

<p>Taiwan share prices closed lower on Saturday, reflecting sharp falls overnight on major world markets over comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, brokers said.</p>
<p>Greenspan had said in a speech in the United States on Thursday night that the Fed should be wary of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in stock and asset markets because this could hurt the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Stock and money market traders worldwide feared Greenspan was suggesting the possibility of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>The index ended down 27.20 points, or 0.40 percent, at 6,779.61. Turnover was a modest T$37.28 billion.  </p>
<p>&quot;Investors simply were taking the chance to take profits after the index failed to break resistance at 7,000 points in recent sessions,&quot; said Allen Huang, a trading manager at National Securities.</p>
<p>Electronics continued to fall despite an expected rebound after recent heavy profit-taking, with Acer down T$1.5 to T$50.</p>
<p>Financials and plastics were also weak, but automobile, steel and cement shares rebounded.  </p>
<p>Investors were worried that the central bank might tighten monetary policy after the market's November rally and also possible interest rate hikes by the United States.</p>
<p>But after the market closed, central bank vice governor Hsu Chia-tung told journalists that the bank had no plans to adjust its stable-to-loose monetary policy despite a recent surge in stock prices driven in part by loose liquidity.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected the profit-taking pressue to slow down next week, with a small rebound likely.</p>
<p>A 6,700-6,900 range was seen for next week. -- James Peng (5080815)</p>
