<p>A Chinese court has sentenced a 56-year-old dissident to five years in prison for counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement, his lawyer said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Zhang Zong'ai has appealed the sentence, handed down this week by the Intermediate People's Court in Xi'an in the northern province of Shaanxi, the Hong Kong-based Human Rights and Democracy in China Information Centre said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Zhang was previously jailed for five years for demanding Premier Li Peng be impeached for ordering the military to crush student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in June 1989, the human rights watchdog said.</p>
<p>His lawyer Zhang Jiankang told Reuters by telephone the court had found Zhang guilty for attacking China's judiciary in an interview with former student leader Wang Dan which was subsequently published in a Hong Kong newspaper.</p>
<p>Wang, a former student leader of the 1989 democracy demonstrations, was sentenced to 11 years in prison last month for conspiring to subvert the government.</p>
<p>The court also found Zhang guilty of signing a petition last year urging authorities to show political tolerance, the lawyer said.</p>
<p>The lawyer said the court cleared Zhang of any wrongdoing in accepting money from an overseas' group. The court ruled Zhang did accept money but that he did not use the funds for counter-revolutionary activities.</p>
<p>The lawyer said the verdict also did not mention a charge in the bill of indictment which accused Zhang of &quot;pledging loyalty&quot; to the Taiwan authorities by writing to General Wego Chiang.</p>
<p>Chiang is the sole surviving son of the late Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, who fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949. China regards Taiwan as a rebel province.</p>
<p>The dissident had not mailed a letter to Chiang which was found in his home in Xi'an.</p>
<p>In recent months, the Chinese authorities have dealt crushing blows to the struggling democracy movement.</p>
<p>Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps.</p>
<p>China dismisses criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.</p>
<p>Three pro-democracy activists are currently standing trial on charges of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement in Hefei, capital of the central province of Anhui.</p>
<p>In the southern boomtown of Shenzhen that neighbours Hong Kong, two labour activists are standing trial for conspiring to subvert the government.</p>
