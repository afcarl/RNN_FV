Taiwan central unworried by cash-driven stock rise.

TAIPEI 1996-12-07

Taiwan's central bank said on Saturday it had no plans to adjust its stable-to-loose monetary policy despite a recent surge in stock prices driven in part by loose liquidity.  

"The central bank has been adopting a stable-to-loose monetary policy so the (bullish) stock market performance has been expected," central bank vice governor Hsu Chia-tung said.

"The market has risen some 30 percent this year which looks a bit high," he told reporters. "But that is because of the comparatively low base in 1995."

The stock market's weighted index has risen 32 percent in 1996 and has mounted a minor recent rally that has added more than 200 points or 3.3 percent since mid-November.

The index lost 27.2 points or 0.4 percent to 6,779.61 in Saturday's session, apparently unaffected by Hsu's comments.  

The November rally is widely believed to have been sparked by political buying by government funds and sustained by relatively loose liquidity in Taiwan's money markets.

Hsu reiterated the central bank's oft-stated view that loose liquidity was no economic cure-all, citing the inability of the stock index to break through resistance despite the relatively easy money in Taiwan's market.

"The index has tried but failed to break the 7,000 point level," he said. "That means the ability of liquidity to drive the market higher is limited."  

For this reason, he said, the central bank has no plans to adjust monetary policy unless a liquidity-driven stock rally begins to affect the Taiwan dollar exchange rate or triggers inflation.

"Unless the stock market affects (the stability of) the foreign exchange market or consumer prices, the central bank will not take action," Hsu said.

The local dollar has been rock solid against the U.S. dollar since a short-lived depreciation at mid-year. The consumer price index has been stable at just above 3 percent since bad weather pushed prices temporarily higher in July and August.  

Hsu's comments were the first by Taiwan's central bank since comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan sent stock prices tumbling on major world markets on Friday.

Greenspan had said in a speech in the United States on Thursday night that "irrational exuberance" in the financial markets could damage the U.S. economy.

His cautious comments shook stock and money market traders worldwide, who feared he was suggesting the possibility of higher interest rates.
