Authorities on Saturday retrieved the bodies of seven construction workers and searched for seven others swept away by a mudslide at a mountain village in central Japan near a 1998 Winter Olympics ski site, police said.

More than 1,400 rescue workers used sniffer dogs to search the steep stream bed as workers reinforced embankments to prevent further mudslides at Otari village in Nagano prefecture, 230 km (140 miles) northwest of Tokyo.

A mudslide tore through a steep river valley on Friday morning after rains melted heavy snow that had accumulated upstream last week.

The torrent of mud and rocks washed away a bridge and blocked access to a hamlet of about 30 people, police said. Eight persons were injured, one critically.

Dumptrucks, a crane and cars were mixed with the boulders and thick mud that surged down a fast-moving stream and dragged the workers in their path.

The missing and dead workers, which include three women, were among a crew of about 50 who were restoring an embankment that had been damaged in a 1995 landslide, police said.

Of 20 workers caught in the landslide, six were rescued.

The accident occurred in a ski resort and hot spring spa area, a region of steep, rugged mountains prone to landslides.

Otari is 10 km (six miles) from one of the main ski slopes to be used in the 1998 Winter Olympics at Nagano.

The landslide closed a road linking the area with Japan's west coast, the second time in 14 months the route was cut off.

The highway restoration project was not connected with preparations for the Winter Games, police said.
