Taiwan had a trade surplus of US$1.294 billion in November, down 9.1 percent compared to November 1995, the finance ministry said on Saturday.  

The following is a table of trade figures in millions of U.S. dollars:

			 November 1996   November 1995  change (pct)

 Exports			10,290	     9,950	    +3.4

 Imports			 8,997	     8,528	    +5.5

 Trade balance		 1,294	     1,423	    -9.1

The ministry attributed both the export and import growth to improved exports to Hong Kong and Europe, and rising imports from United States, Europe and southeast Asia.

Exports to Hong Kong and Europe rose an annual 10.1 and 5.1 percent, respectively, after declining in October, indicating improving exports, the ministry said in a statement.

In November, imports of capital equipment and consumption goods continued to rise, gaining 10.8 percent and 10.7 percent year-on-year, respectively, it said.  

"November's agricultural and industrial raw material imports also showed a 3.3 percent rise, the first gain since February 1996, indicating a gradual expansion of domestic demand," the statement said.

"With easing Taiwan-China tensions and gradually recovery in the domestic economy, (the ministry) expects our exports and imports to resume upward momentum in the future," it said.

Exports to Hong Kong reached $2.58 billion, accounting for 25.1 percent of the island's total exports, surpassing the United States to become Taiwan's top export target.  

Exports to the United States fell 2.4 percent from a year earlier to $2.24 billion.

Japan was the top source of Taiwan imports, accounting for $2.44 billion or 27.1 percent of the total, followed by the United States at $1.85 billion and Europe at $1.53 billion.
