<p>Taiwan had a trade surplus of US$1.294 billion in November, down 9.1 percent compared to November 1995, the finance ministry said on Saturday.  </p>
<p>The following is a table of trade figures in millions of U.S. dollars:</p>
<p>			 November 1996   November 1995  change (pct)</p>
<p> Exports			10,290	     9,950	    +3.4</p>
<p> Imports			 8,997	     8,528	    +5.5</p>
<p> Trade balance		 1,294	     1,423	    -9.1</p>
<p>The ministry attributed both the export and import growth to improved exports to Hong Kong and Europe, and rising imports from United States, Europe and southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Exports to Hong Kong and Europe rose an annual 10.1 and 5.1 percent, respectively, after declining in October, indicating improving exports, the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>In November, imports of capital equipment and consumption goods continued to rise, gaining 10.8 percent and 10.7 percent year-on-year, respectively, it said.  </p>
<p>&quot;November's agricultural and industrial raw material imports also showed a 3.3 percent rise, the first gain since February 1996, indicating a gradual expansion of domestic demand,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;With easing Taiwan-China tensions and gradually recovery in the domestic economy, (the ministry) expects our exports and imports to resume upward momentum in the future,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Exports to Hong Kong reached $2.58 billion, accounting for 25.1 percent of the island's total exports, surpassing the United States to become Taiwan's top export target.  </p>
<p>Exports to the United States fell 2.4 percent from a year earlier to $2.24 billion.</p>
<p>Japan was the top source of Taiwan imports, accounting for $2.44 billion or 27.1 percent of the total, followed by the United States at $1.85 billion and Europe at $1.53 billion.</p>
<p>Taiwan's biggest bilateral surplus in November was with Hong Kong at $2.42 billion, up 11.5 percent from a year ago. Its surplus with the United States was $385 million, down 33 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p>The surplus with Europe was $6.6 million, compared to a deficit of $36 million a year earlier.  </p>
<p>Taiwan had a trade deficit with Japan at $1.28 billion, down 3.3 percent from a year ago.</p>
