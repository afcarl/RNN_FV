<title>SOUTH KOREA: S.Korea's second largest labour union plans strike.</title>
<headline>S.Korea's second largest labour union plans strike.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1996-12-07</dateline>

<p>South Korea's second largest union group, joining the country's biggest labour group, decided on Saturday to hold two strikes over the next 10 days to protest government plans to revise decades-old labour laws.</p>
<p>An official of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions said workers would go on a partial strike on December 13 and a full strike three days later.</p>
<p>&quot;We have decided on a partial strike on December 13 for four hours unless the government withdraws the labour reform plan,&quot; the official told reporters. &quot;Then we'll have an all-out strike on December 16.&quot;</p>
<p>The official said his group was also considering coordinating industrial action with the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, the nation's largest union organisation, which has already announced it plans a one-hour strike on December 16 and a longer work stoppage on December 19.</p>
<p>If the two groups decide to synchronise their strikes, the action was likely to bring South Korean business to a stop on whatever days were finally chosen over the next two weeks.</p>
<p>The smaller confederation represents major workplaces, including Hyundai Motor Co, the country's largest carmaker, Kia Motors Corp, Hyundai Heavy Industries Co and Daewoo Heavy Industries Co.</p>
<p>The larger federation represents workers at most other major businesses.</p>
<p>Since the labour reform plans, the first in 43 years, were announced on Tuesday, unions have complained the emphasis is on helping business and making it more competitive, not protecting workers' rights.</p>
<p>Unions object in particular to articles that open the way to worker layoffs and the introduction of flexible working hours that would hit seasonal workers and overstaffed industries.</p>
<p>The reform plan is expected to be put to parliament and passed before it goes into recess on December 19.</p>
<p>The threat of industrial action was a key factor contributing to a steady fall in the South Korean stock market last week to its lowest level in more than three years.</p>
<p>&quot;The spectre of violent labour strife seems to be reviving. It's scaring investors away from the market,&quot; said Choo Hee-yup, a broker at Dongwon Securities last week.</p>
<p>Brokers said the banking industry, long regarded as overstaffed, may be the most vulnerable to labour unrest in the near term because under the reforms companies can lay off workers for economic reasons.</p>
