Hizbollah guerrillas killed one Israeli soldier and wounded two on Saturday in the bloodiest attack on Israeli forces in south Lebanon in nearly a month, pro-Israeli militia sources said.

Israeli gunners responded by firing internationally banned anti-personnel shells at a village in the area, wounding six civilians, security sources said.

The guerrillas set off a road-side bomb as an Israeli patrol was passing and fired Sagger missiles at the soldiers and a nearby post at Arnoun on the edge of Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone, sources with the Israeli-armed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia said.

They said one Israeli soldier was killed and two were wounded -- bringing to 25 the number of Israeli soldiers killed in south Lebanon so far this year, two more than last year's total.

It was the bloodiest assault on Israeli forces occupying the 15-km (nine-miles)-deep south Lebanon zone since November 9 when Hizbollah fighters also killed one soldier and wounded two in an attack on their post.

In Beirut, the Shi'ite Moslem group Hizbollah claimed responsibility for the Arnoun attack.

It said in a statement that one of its units "set off a bomb at 2:45 p.m. (12:45 GMT) in a mechanised Zionist patrol with seven foot soldiers in the lead...causing the death or wounding of at least five soldiers".

The Iranian-backed group is opposed to Arab-Israeli peace talks and leads a guerrilla war on 1,000 Israeli troops and the 3,000-strong SLA to drive them from the south Lebanon zone set up in 1985 to stop raids on northern Israel.

"The Islamic Resistance asserts that it will continue in the road of jihad (holy war) and liberation until the enemy is evicted from our land," Hizbollah's statement added.

Lebanese security sources said the six civilians were lightly wounded when an anti-personnel flechette (dart) shell slammed inside the village of Kfar Tibnit, facing the area of Saturday's attack.

"The Israeli shelling was concentrated around the village of Kfar Tibnit, on the Yohmor-Arnoun road (on the zone's edge). The six were wounded when a flechette shell exploded near the mosque where they were standing," one security source said.

A Reuters reporter saw one of the six wounded, a woman, with a dart stuck in her back. U.N. officials say flechette shells are banned internationally.

A U.S.-brokered ceasefire that ended a 17-day Israeli blitz on south Lebanon in April bars the targeting of civilian areas by Israeli forces or Hizbollah. Some 200 people, mainly civilians, were killed in that Israeli air, land and sea military campaign against Hizbollah.
