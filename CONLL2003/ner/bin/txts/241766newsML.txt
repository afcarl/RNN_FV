Arafat holds talks in Egypt with Mubarak.

CAIRO 1996-12-07

Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak held talks on Saturday in Cairo on the Middle East peace process, officials said.

They said Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa was also present. Arafat arrived in the Egyptian capital on Saturday.

Egyptian television said Arafat would discuss Moussa's talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week in Lisbon.

PLO negotiators had said on Friday they were hoping that Netanyahu would join Arafat and Mubarak this weekend in Cairo, but these hopes were dashed.

Both Arafat and Netanyahu have expressed willingness to meet. They last met in Washington after clashes in September that killed 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis. The violence was spurred by Israel's opening an entrance to a tunnel near Moslem sites in Jerusalem.

Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) negotiators said the last two weeks of talks with Israel on implementing the long-delayed handover of most of the West Bank town of Hebron to PLO rule had been "meaningless".
