Guerrillas kill Israeli soldier in south Lebanon.

MARJAYOUN, Lebanon 1996-12-07

Guerrillas killed one Israeli soldier and wounded two in an attack on an Israeli army patrol in south Lebanon on Saturday, pro-Israeli militia sources said.

Israeli gunners responded by firing internationally banned anti-personnel shells at a village in the area, wounding six civilians, security sources said.

The guerrillas set off a road-side bomb as an Israeli patrol was passing and fired Sagger missiles at the soldiers and a nearby post at Arnoun on the edge of Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone, the sources with the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia said.

The sources said one Israeli soldier was killed and two were wounded in the assault.

In Beirut, the pro-Iranian Hizbollah claimed responsibility for the Arnoun attack, saying it caused a number of Israeli casualties.

Lebanese security sources said the six civilians were lightly wounded when an anti-personnel flechette (dart) shell slammed inside the village of Kfar Tibnit, facing the area of the attack.

"The Israeli shelling was concentrated around the village of Kfar Tibnit, on the Yohmor-Arnoun road (on zone's edge). The six were wounded when a flechette shell exploded near the mosque where they were standing," one security source said.

A Reuters reporter saw one of the six wounded, a woman, with a dart stuck in her back. U.N. officials say flechette shells are banned internationally.

Hizbollah (Party of God) leads a guerrilla war against 1,000 Israeli troops and the 3,000-strong SLA in a bid to oust them from the south Lebanon zone set up in 1985 to stop cross-border raids on northern Israel.
