<title>LEBANON: Guerrillas kill Israeli soldier in south Lebanon.</title>

<p>Guerrillas killed one Israeli soldier and wounded two in an attack on an Israeli army patrol in south Lebanon on Saturday, pro-Israeli militia sources said.</p>
<p>Israeli gunners responded by firing internationally banned anti-personnel shells at a village in the area, wounding six civilians, security sources said.</p>
<p>The guerrillas set off a road-side bomb as an Israeli patrol was passing and fired Sagger missiles at the soldiers and a nearby post at Arnoun on the edge of Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone, the sources with the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia said.</p>
<p>The sources said one Israeli soldier was killed and two were wounded in the assault.</p>
<p>In Beirut, the pro-Iranian Hizbollah claimed responsibility for the Arnoun attack, saying it caused a number of Israeli casualties.</p>
<p>Lebanese security sources said the six civilians were lightly wounded when an anti-personnel flechette (dart) shell slammed inside the village of Kfar Tibnit, facing the area of the attack.</p>
<p>&quot;The Israeli shelling was concentrated around the village of Kfar Tibnit, on the Yohmor-Arnoun road (on zone's edge). The six were wounded when a flechette shell exploded near the mosque where they were standing,&quot; one security source said.</p>
<p>A Reuters reporter saw one of the six wounded, a woman, with a dart stuck in her back. U.N. officials say flechette shells are banned internationally.</p>
<p>Hizbollah (Party of God) leads a guerrilla war against 1,000 Israeli troops and the 3,000-strong SLA in a bid to oust them from the south Lebanon zone set up in 1985 to stop cross-border raids on northern Israel.</p>
