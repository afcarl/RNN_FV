Gulf Arab leaders gathered in Doha on Saturday for their annual summit but Bahrain boycotted the event because of an espionage row and a long-standing territorial dispute with hosts Qatar.

Only three heads of state -- from Kuwait, Oman and Qatar -- are attending the meeting of the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and the emir of the United Arab Emirates, both in ill health, sent deputies.

An official source in Manama said Bahrain would not attend the summit and would also boycott lower-level GCC meetings to be held in future in Qatar, the new rotating head of the economic and political alliance.

It was the first time a GCC member had boycotted a GCC summit since the group was formed in 1981 in response to worries over the perceived threat from Iran after the outbreak of its war with Iraq, the Gulf Arabs' ally at that time.

The dispute between Bahrain and neighbouring Qatar over a cluster of reefs, sandbanks and islands led to a military skirmish in 1986.

Relations between the GCC's two smallest members worsened this week when Bahrain put a Qatari man and woman on trial on charges of spying. Qatar denied the allegation and accused Bahrain of torturing the man to obtain a confession.

Qatar's delegation walked out of the final session of last year's summit in Oman to protest against the appointment of a Saudi as GCC secretary-general.

Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah said on arrival in Doha that he regretted the "aggression against our Palestinian brothers on the beloved land of Palestine".

"Does this world does not see that peace is not achieved by force and seizure of legitimate rghts?" he said.

He said the Middle East peace process had been dealt repeated blows. "Only God knows the extent of the dangers" which would follow the collapse of the process, he said.

Political unity, economic integration and military coordination between the six Gulf Arab oil states were on the agenda for the three-day meeting due to start at 1700 GMT.

Despite a public display of unity and accord on most issues, Western and Arab diplomats said many differences, such as border and other disputes, had blocked the group's ambitious plans to form a common market and unify custom tariffs to facilitate trade with such groups as the European Union.

"They have not achieved any real and concrete integration in any of the key fields like the economy and defence," said an Arab diplomat. "I think this meeting could be yet another ceremonial gathering," he added.
