<p>King Hussein of Jordan arrived in the United Arab Emirates on Saturday on his first visit since relations soured over the 1990 Gulf crisis, officials said.</p>
<p>UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan, ministers and officials welcomed the monarch after he arrived at Abu Dhabi airport, crowning a gradual reconciliation in ties.</p>
<p>The two leaders, who had their first encounter in six years in Geneva in July, inspected honour guards before heading to the palace for an official lunch, the officials added.</p>
<p>&quot;The visit will give both leaders a chance to exchange views on Iraq, especially after its acceptance of U.N. terms for the oil-for-food deal, the overall situation in the Gulf and Middle East peace,&quot; a Jordanian official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Jordan angered its Gulf Arab allies by refusing to join the U.S.-led military coalition which recaptured Kuwait from Iraqi forces in February 1991.</p>
<p>But its turn against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein after top Baghdad defections in August 1995 helped it mend fences with most Gulf Arab states, except Kuwait, where anti-Jordanian sentiment remains strong.</p>
<p>Both Jordan and the UAE have made gestures towards Iraq and have publicly called for an easing of the suffering of the Iraqi people under U.N. sanctions imposed for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.</p>
<p>Jordan has stepped up efforts to mend ties with Iraq since Baghdad last month accepted United Nations terms allowing it to sell oil worth $2 billion to buy food and medicine. Jordan's business community wants to resume trade with Iraq.</p>
<p>Sheikh Zaid, worried by Iraq's international isolation and the growing power of Iran, recently renewed a call on fellow Gulf Arab states to heal the scars caused by the Gulf War.</p>
<p>But the move sharpened differences with Kuwait, which has rejected such calls and is still bitter over Iraq's lightning invasion that shocked militarily vulnerable Gulf Arab states.</p>
<p>King Hussein met Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf on Friday -- the first such high-level meeting since Amman turned against Baghdad and allowed an Iraqi opposition group to open an office in Amman.</p>
