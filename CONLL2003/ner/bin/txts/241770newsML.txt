Gulf leaders gather in Qatar without Bahrain.

Gulf Arab leaders began arriving in Qatar on Saturday for their annual summit but Bahrain appeared determined to boycott the event.

Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah was the first arrival in Doha among leaders of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), whose members together control almost half the world's proven oil reserves.

Bahrain, locked in a territorial dispute with host Qatar, said it would not come to Doha although organisers still held out hope of a last-minute mediation effort to persuade Manama to send a delegation.

Bahraini flags and posters of its Emir, Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, were put up in the Qatari capital along with those of other GCC states.

It would be the first time a GCC member state has boycotted the event from the start since the group was formed in 1981 as a response to Gulf Arab worries over the Iran-Iraq war.

Bahrain and neighbouring Qatar are in dispute over a cluster of reefs, sandbanks and islands, a source of ill-feeling which led to a brief military clash in 1986.

Relations between the GCC's two smallest members worsened this week when Bahrain put a Qatari man and woman on trial on charges of alleged espionage. Qatar denied the allegation and accused Bahrain of torturing the man to obtain a confession.

Ironically, Qatar itself was the first state to boycott part of a summit when its delegation walked out of last year's final session in Oman to protest against the appointment of a Saudi as GCC secretary-general.

This year's three-day summit was due to open later on Saturday.

King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, the GCC's dominant power, is sending Crown Prince Abdullah in his place. The king also missed last year's meeting after suffering a stroke.

The President of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan, will also be absent. He is recuperating from surgery in September and is sending the UAE Prime Minister, Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid al-Maktoum.

Political unity, economic integration and military coordination between the six Gulf Arab oil states -- Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar -- were on the agenda.

Despite a public display of unity and accord on most issues, Western and Arab diplomats said many differences such as border and other disputes had blocked the group's ambitious plans to form a common market and unify custom tariffs to facilitate trade with such major blocks as the European Union.

"I think the problem is also that we did not have mature state institutions when the GCC was formed to facilitate cooperation and integration among institutions in other member states," said a senior GCC delegate.

"We were still in the process of building our own institutions."

"They have not achieved any real and concrete integration in any of the key fields like the economy and defence," said an Arab diplomat. "I think this meeting could be yet another ceremonial gathering."
