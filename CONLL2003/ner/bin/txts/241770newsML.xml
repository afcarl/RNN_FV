<p>Gulf Arab leaders began arriving in Qatar on Saturday for their annual summit but Bahrain appeared determined to boycott the event.</p>
<p>Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah was the first arrival in Doha among leaders of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), whose members together control almost half the world's proven oil reserves.</p>
<p>Bahrain, locked in a territorial dispute with host Qatar, said it would not come to Doha although organisers still held out hope of a last-minute mediation effort to persuade Manama to send a delegation.</p>
<p>Bahraini flags and posters of its Emir, Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, were put up in the Qatari capital along with those of other GCC states.</p>
<p>It would be the first time a GCC member state has boycotted the event from the start since the group was formed in 1981 as a response to Gulf Arab worries over the Iran-Iraq war.</p>
<p>Bahrain and neighbouring Qatar are in dispute over a cluster of reefs, sandbanks and islands, a source of ill-feeling which led to a brief military clash in 1986.</p>
<p>Relations between the GCC's two smallest members worsened this week when Bahrain put a Qatari man and woman on trial on charges of alleged espionage. Qatar denied the allegation and accused Bahrain of torturing the man to obtain a confession.</p>
<p>Ironically, Qatar itself was the first state to boycott part of a summit when its delegation walked out of last year's final session in Oman to protest against the appointment of a Saudi as GCC secretary-general.</p>
<p>This year's three-day summit was due to open later on Saturday.</p>
<p>King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, the GCC's dominant power, is sending Crown Prince Abdullah in his place. The king also missed last year's meeting after suffering a stroke.</p>
<p>The President of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan, will also be absent. He is recuperating from surgery in September and is sending the UAE Prime Minister, Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid al-Maktoum.</p>
<p>Political unity, economic integration and military coordination between the six Gulf Arab oil states -- Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar -- were on the agenda.</p>
<p>Despite a public display of unity and accord on most issues, Western and Arab diplomats said many differences such as border and other disputes had blocked the group's ambitious plans to form a common market and unify custom tariffs to facilitate trade with such major blocks as the European Union.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the problem is also that we did not have mature state institutions when the GCC was formed to facilitate cooperation and integration among institutions in other member states,&quot; said a senior GCC delegate.</p>
<p>&quot;We were still in the process of building our own institutions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They have not achieved any real and concrete integration in any of the key fields like the economy and defence,&quot; said an Arab diplomat. &quot;I think this meeting could be yet another ceremonial gathering.&quot;</p>
