<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa has said the Middle East peace process, described by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as in real danger, must be &quot;saved and protected&quot;.</p>
<p>Moussa spoke to reporters late on Saturday after separate meetings in Cairo with Arafat and the European Union's Middle East envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos.</p>
<p>The foreign minister said he briefed Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak about his talks last week in Lisbon with Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a long discussion about the situation in order to save the peace process and push it forward,&quot; Moussa said. &quot;There are a lot of points that have to be tackled...The important thing is that the peace process has to be saved and protected.</p>
<p>Peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians have run into problems, mainly over the issue of Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron, the last town in the occupied West Bank to be handed over to Palestinian rule.</p>
<p>Israel wants to renegotiate some of the terms of the handover out of security concerns, while the Palestinians want to implement the accord as they signed it.</p>
<p>Palestinian negotiators said the last two weeks of talks with Israel on the handover of most of Hebron had been &quot;meaningless&quot;.</p>
<p>Both Arafat and Netanyahu have expressed willingness to meet, but Moussa said: &quot;That is up to them. But we haven't discussed this point, at least for the time being.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu and Arafat last met in Washington after clashes in September that killed 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis, spurred by Israel opening a tunnel near Moslem holy sites in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Arafat was quoted by the Al-Hayat newspaper as saying last week that the peace process was in &quot;real danger&quot; and he expected a military confrontration between Israel and Syria.</p>
<p>Syria told the EU's Moratinos it wanted to resume peace talks with Israel, but insisted Netanyahu should honour the outcome of talks held with his assassinated predecessor Yitzhak Rabin, officials said in Damascus.</p>
<p>Moratinos, speaking to reporters after his talks on Saturday with Moussa in Cairo after his arrival from Damascus, said: &quot;I think there's still some great concern about the situation, but there's some hope that certain issues can be solved with not a long delay.&quot;</p>
<p>The EU envoy, who is also Spain's ambassador to Israel, is due to meet Mubarak on Sunday. He held talks with Arafat and Israeli officials before his visit to Cairo.</p>
<p>&quot;In the meeting with President Arafat, the Israelis and now Foreign Minister Moussa, (it) gave me a little more hope that the Hebron issue could be solved in two days, three days probably,&quot; Moratinos said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know the way, but probably they will meet. I think they are advancing, they are making progress,&quot; he said. &quot;But still there are some issues that have to be solved.&quot;</p>
