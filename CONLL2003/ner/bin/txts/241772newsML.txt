Qatar calls for Gulf Arab integration, open market.

Gulf Arab leaders, whose summit has been marred by a Bahraini boycott, will tackle on Sunday some of the many obstacles that have blocked integration and the formation of a common market among their oil-rich states.

In his opening address on Saturday, Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani called on Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states to grant the private sector a larger role in running the economy and put an end to protectionist measures.

GCC members Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Oman are all attending the December 7-9 summit, but Bahrain boycotted the annual event due to bitter differences with host Qatar over a territorial dispute.

Another bone of contention was the start of a trial on Wednesday in Manama of two Qataris charged with spying.

"All were upset that Bahrain boycotted, even Bahrain's close friends wanted it to come despite the rows," said one delegate.

But the leaders are going ahead with the summit agenda while ministers are holding talks on the sidelines to try to narrow differences blocking real integration, such as customs tariffs unification.

Sheikh Hamad, the head of the GCC for the next year, urged members on Saturday night "to redouble efforts...to achieve integration" at a time when other blocks "are moving fast to put an end to all restrictions and barriers...

"This entails the necessity of removing all existing restrictions and reconsideration of the protectionist policies followed by some countries to subsidise their national economy. We have to take, in the policies we adopt, all these matters into consideration," he added.

But despite his remarks, GCC delegates and diplomats say this summit could once again fail to announce clear steps towards integration in various fields.

"We are all frustrated with what is not happening...This summit could be yet another gathering for picture-taking and ceremonies," said one senior delegate.

But the finance and economy ministers of the alliance held late night talks on Saturday to try to resolve differences blocking the unification of customs tariffs, a key and long-delayed step to reach a free trade accord with other blocs and form a GCC common market.

The UAE, a major regional trading and re-export hub, is reluctant to raise its tariffs beyond the four to six percent level which is imposed on most goods while Saudi Arabia, which has tariffs of 20 percent on some items, is in favour of a GCC unified level of 8-12 percent for most goods.

"This is too high at a time when we are seeking an accord with the EU (European Union) and GCC integration into the World Trade (Organisation)," said a delegate.

EU-GCC talks on the issue have been going on for more than 10 years and the foreign ministers of the two blocs agreed in April on a timeframe of no more than two years to complete the crucial free trade accord.

Such an accord could open European markets to petrochemicals from GCC states which have spent billions of dollars over the past 15 years developing an impressive industry.
