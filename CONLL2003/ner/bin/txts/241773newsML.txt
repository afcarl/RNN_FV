Israel confirms Israeli soldier killed in Lebanon.

JERUSALEM 1996-12-07

The Israeli army confirmed that an Israeli soldier had been killed on Saturday in an attack by Hizbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon.

Another soldier was wounded in the incident in which the pro-Iranian guerrillas set off a road-side bomb and fired Sagger missiles at an Israeli patrol in the "security zone" declared by Israel, it said.

The army had delayed announcement of the soldier's death, first reported by pro-Israeli militia sources in south Lebanon, so that his family could be notified.
