<p>Gulf Arab states held talks on Saturday to try to resolve differences blocking the unification of custom tariffs, a key step before they can reach free trade accords with major trading blocs, delegates said.</p>
<p>Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) ministers of finance and economy were holding talks late into the night on the sidelines of the annual GCC summit in Qatar.</p>
<p>&quot;The main problem in this issue is between Saudi Arabia and the (United Arab) Emirates,&quot; a senior delegate said.</p>
<p>The UAE, a major regional trading and re-export hub, is reluctant to raise its tariffs beyond the four to six percent level which is imposed on most goods while Saudi Arabia, which has tariffs of 20 percent on some items, is in favour of a unified GCC level of 8-12 percent for most goods.</p>
<p>&quot;This is too high at a time when we are seeking an accord with the EU (European Union) and GCC integration into the World Trade Organisation,&quot; said a delegate.</p>
<p>The ministers held a round of talks earlier on Saturday ahead of the official start of the three-day summit to discuss a Saudi Arabian proposal on the issue. Any agreement they might reach should be reviewed by GCC foreign ministers before it is presented to the summit.</p>
<p>EU-GCC talks on issue have been going on for more than 10 years and the foreign ministers of the two blocs agreed in April on a time frame of no more than two years to complete the crucial free trade accord.</p>
<p>Such an accord could open European markets to cheap petrochemicals from Gulf Arab states which have spent billion of dollars over the past 15 years developing an impressive petrochemical industry.</p>
<p>A final GCC accord on tariffs has been postponed several times and some officials were expecting one at the last GCC summit in Oman a year ago. The GCC's six members control almost half of the world's proven oil reserves.</p>
<p>A year after Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain formed the GCC in 1981, member states ratified the Unified Economic Agreement with impelemenation of steps starting the following year.</p>
<p>Many GCC and foreign businessmen complain of slow progress with no real steps taken towards forming a common GCC market.</p>
<p>But in a television interview on Saturday, GCC Secretary General Jameel al-Hujilan defended the group's &quot;many achievements&quot; in the economic field.</p>
<p>He said GCC states did not impose tariffs on goods made in a fellow GCC state, Gulf Arab citizens could work without a permit and apply for loans in any of the six countries and had the right to trade on GCC stock markets.</p>
