<p>A Lebanese military prosecutor on Saturday ordered the arrest of a policeman for the murder of a Palestinian accused of involvement in a multi-million dollar fraud, judicial sources said.</p>
<p>They said corporal Eala Ra'ad was charged with killing Farid Mousalli, one of six men accused of forging revenue stamps and selling genuine stamps from the finance ministry. Police had said last month Mousalli died in an exchange of fire with police trying to arrest him.</p>
<p>Reports of the amount of money involved range from 15 billion Lebanese pounds to 3.8 billion ($9.7 million to $2.5 million). The case has caused a sensation in Lebanon.</p>
<p>The military prosecutor also ordered the arrest of Colonel Jean Michel for entering Mousalli's apartment after the shooting &quot;in contravention of military instructions&quot;.</p>
<p>If convicted, Ra'ad could face the death penalty while Michel faces up to three years jail. Both men, members of the police State Security organ, have been under interrogation since Mousalli's killing.</p>
<p>On Friday, judicial sources said Mousalli and two gang members in custody, had murdered Ra'afat Sleiman, a junior finance ministry official accused of being party to the scheme.</p>
<p>Sleiman disappeared in September and his body was found on Saturday buried near a north Lebanon village, the sources said.</p>
