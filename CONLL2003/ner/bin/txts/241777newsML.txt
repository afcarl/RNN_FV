Western Iranian cities calm after riots.

TEHRAN 1996-12-07

The Kurdish-populated cities of Kermanshah, Paveh and Javanrud in western Iran were calm on Saturday after several days of riots in which at least one police officer was killed, residents and journalists said.

"Police cars are patrolling the streets but there has been no unrest or clashes in the last two days," a journalist told Reuters by telephone from Kermanshah.

Riots erupted in the three cities after word spread that Molla Mohammad Rabi'i, a popular Sunni Moslem cleric who was found dead on Monday, had been assassinated.

The clashes in Kermanshah, a provincial capital of more than 600,000 people some 525 km (325 miles) west of Tehran, centred around the Shafei mosque, where the 64-year-old Kurdish prayer leader's body was found next to his car.

Newspapers on Saturday carried statements by the cleric's son saying his father had died of a heart attack.

Sunni clerics in Paveh and Javanrud said during Friday prayers that Rabi'i's death was due to natural causes and urged their followers to ignore rumours.

The Islamic republic is predominantly Shi'ite Moslem, with a large minority of Sunnis spread thoughout the country.

Iran's state-run television said earlier a number of people had been arrested in Kermanshah.

A journalist in Kermanshah told Reuters on Thursday that a police colonel was killed during clashes on Wednesday.
