<p>Israel on Saturday condemned a Lebanese death sentence in absentia against the commander of a pro-Israeli militia in south Lebanon as an attempt to prevent peace.</p>
<p>A Lebanese military court on Friday convicted General Antoine Lahd, head of the South Lebanon Army (SLA), of collaborating with Israel by helping enforce its occupation of Lebanese territory.</p>
<p>Calling Lahd a &quot;Lebanese patriot&quot;, a spokesman for Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said the sentence was &quot;a provocation meant to sabotage the chances&quot; of an Israeli-Lebanese peace agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;The sentence will be thrown onto the rubbish heap of history,&quot; the spokesman said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;(It) shows without a doubt that Lebanon has no national will of its own...To our regret, it is incapable in the current situation of being a legitimate and serious partner for negotiations with us.&quot;</p>
<p>Lahd, a 69-year-old former Lebanese army major-general, heads the 3,000-strong SLA militia which helps Israel hold a border zone in south Lebanon to prevent guerrilla raids on northern Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;Defence Minister Mordechai said we will continue to offer all possible aid to General Lahd, the SLA, the population of the 'security zone' and all those taking part in daily activities against terror originating in Lebanon,&quot; the Israeli statement said.</p>
<p>After the trial began on February 16, Lahd said Lebanese authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Ladh was charged with: forming a hostile army, carrying weapons on Israel's side, helping Israel strip off a part of Lebanese territory by violence, forming an armed gang, killing or trying to kill Lebanese civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping Lebanese citizens for long periods.</p>
<p>Shortly before his trial, a Beirut military prosecutor charged another 89 former Lebanese soldiers with collaboration. No date has been set for the trial of the men, all members of the SLA living in the Israeli-held zone in south Lebanon.</p>
<p>Israel and Lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the SLA -- a mixed Christian-Shi'ite Moslem force -- which the Jewish states regards as loyal allies. Israel has said the Lebanese army must incorporate the SLA fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace.</p>
<p>Lebanese political analysts have said that would be out of the question and Lebanese authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against Lahd.</p>
