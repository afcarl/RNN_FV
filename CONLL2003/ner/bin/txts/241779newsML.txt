Syria's Shara holds talks with Jordanian officials.

AMMAN 1996-12-07

Syria's Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara held talks on Saturday with Jordanian officials during a brief stopover in Amman, Jordanian official said.

Shara refused to talk to reporters on his arrival at Amman's Queen Alia airport where he was met by Acting Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour. Shara was on his way to Indonesia to attend a foreign ministers' meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC).

Talks covered the impasse in Arab-Israeli peace talks and bilateral ties, a Jordanian official said.

Jordanian-Syrian ties improved after talks between King Hussein and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in Damascus last August. Syria had accused Jordan of weakening Arab ranks by signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
