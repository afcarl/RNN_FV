Gulf Arab leaders on Saturday started summit talks in Qatar whose government expressed regret for Bahrain's boycott of the annual event.

Bahrain stayed away because of differences with Qatar which include a long-standing territorial dispute and the trial of two alleged Qatari spies in Bahrain which started on Wednesday. It was the first time a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) had boycotted a summit since the group was formed in 1981.

"I would like to express our deep regret (for Bahrain's boycott) and the absence of my dear brother His Highness (Bahraini Emir) Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa," Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani told the opening session.

The GCC also groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. The six members between them control almost half of the world's proven oil reserves.

Bahrain's seat at the summit table remained empty.

The Qatari emir said: "We wish we could have the pleasure of having with us...(Saudi Arabian) King Fahd and (UAE President) Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan." The two leaders missed the summit due to health reasons.

The heads of state of Qatar, Oman and Kuwait are attending the three-day summit while the UAE and Saudi Arabian delegations are headed by Vice-President Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid al-Maktoum and Crown Prince Abdullah respectively.

Earlier in the day GCC finance and economy ministers discussed a proposal by Saudi Arabia, the group's dominant power and largest economy, on unifying custom tariffs, a target which has eluded the alliance for years.

The official Qatar News Agency did not give details of the Saudi proposal but delegates earlier said that there were some differences blocking such a move which is crucial for forging a free trade accord with major blocs such as the European Union.

The GCC and EU have been discussing for years a trade accord which could open lucrative European markets to cheap GCC petrochemicals.

Delegates earlier said UAE member Dubai, the region's leading trade and re-export hub, was opposed to raising its tariffs beyond six percent until other members dropped their rates closer to the 8-10 percent level.

The GCC summit also due to discuss political violence and militant Moslem fundamentalism in the region, ties with Iraq and Iran, and the Middle East peace process.
