<p>Gulf Arab leaders on Saturday started summit talks in Qatar whose government expressed regret for Bahrain's boycott of the annual event.</p>
<p>Bahrain stayed away because of differences with Qatar which include a long-standing territorial dispute and the trial of two alleged Qatari spies in Bahrain which started on Wednesday. It was the first time a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) had boycotted a summit since the group was formed in 1981.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to express our deep regret (for Bahrain's boycott) and the absence of my dear brother His Highness (Bahraini Emir) Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa,&quot; Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani told the opening session.</p>
<p>The GCC also groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. The six members between them control almost half of the world's proven oil reserves.</p>
<p>Bahrain's seat at the summit table remained empty.</p>
<p>The Qatari emir said: &quot;We wish we could have the pleasure of having with us...(Saudi Arabian) King Fahd and (UAE President) Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan.&quot; The two leaders missed the summit due to health reasons.</p>
<p>The heads of state of Qatar, Oman and Kuwait are attending the three-day summit while the UAE and Saudi Arabian delegations are headed by Vice-President Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid al-Maktoum and Crown Prince Abdullah respectively.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day GCC finance and economy ministers discussed a proposal by Saudi Arabia, the group's dominant power and largest economy, on unifying custom tariffs, a target which has eluded the alliance for years.</p>
<p>The official Qatar News Agency did not give details of the Saudi proposal but delegates earlier said that there were some differences blocking such a move which is crucial for forging a free trade accord with major blocs such as the European Union.</p>
<p>The GCC and EU have been discussing for years a trade accord which could open lucrative European markets to cheap GCC petrochemicals.</p>
<p>Delegates earlier said UAE member Dubai, the region's leading trade and re-export hub, was opposed to raising its tariffs beyond six percent until other members dropped their rates closer to the 8-10 percent level.</p>
<p>The GCC summit also due to discuss political violence and militant Moslem fundamentalism in the region, ties with Iraq and Iran, and the Middle East peace process.</p>
