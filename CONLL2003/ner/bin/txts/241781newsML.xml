<p>Egypt's parliament on Saturday agreed to increase penalties against unauthorised mosque preachers to prevent the spread of &quot;deviant&quot; ideas, parliamentary sources said.</p>
<p>They said the changes, which must be signed by President Hosni Mubarak, would provide for fines of 100 to 300 pounds ($29 to $88), up to a month in jail, or both. The present penalty is a five pound fine.</p>
<p>For years the government has tried to keep radical Islamist opponents out of the mosques by controlling mosque finances and appointing prayer leaders favourable to its interpretation of Islam.</p>
<p>&quot;Some societies still allow people not capable to do the job to give the sermons in the mosques, which negatively affects activities of Islamic propagation and gives people with deviant thoughts a chance to use mosques as a forum and spread the wrong concepts of Islam,&quot; said an explanation accompanying the decision.</p>
<p>Egypt announced in October a series of measures to control privately run mosques, the recruiting platform for Islamist opposition groups.</p>
<p>Under that plan the Ministry of Awqaf (religious endowments) will take over 30,000 non-governmental mosques in the next five years, at 6,000 a year.</p>
<p>Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif said in October the state would appoint 6,500 graduates from al-Azhar Islamic university to run mosques. State-run al-Azhar is the bastion of Sunni Moslem orthodoxy.</p>
