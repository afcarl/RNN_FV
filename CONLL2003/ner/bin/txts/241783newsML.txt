Jordan shares hit 11-months high on Iraq sentiment.

AMMAN 1996-12-07

Jordanian stocks rallied at start of weekly trade on Saturday to 11-month highs after new Jordanian overtures towards Iraq bolstered investor sentiment, dealers said.

The Amman Financial Market 60-share index rose 0.91 percent to 155.11 points, its highest level since late February, in one of the year's heaviest trading days with a turnover worth 2.12 million dinars ($3 million).

Brokers said investor morale was boosted after King Hussein's surprise meeting on Friday with Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf -- the first such high-level meeting since Amman turned against Baghdad and allowed an Iraqi opposition group to open an office in Amman.

The market has been steadily reversing its 1996 declines since news broke out last month of Iraq's near implemetation of its oil-for food deal which the business community hopes could activate stagnant industrial sectors and improve next year's performance of blue-chip firms exporting to Iraq.

Brokers said the market was led by key industrials that stand to benefit from exporting to Iraq under the deal. Drug firms that are widely believed to have a competitive advantage were a particular focus of investor attention.

Amongst firms that were underpinned by investor expectations of Iraq-related performance are Intermediate Petrochemicals which rose 0.06 dinars to 1.19 dinars and Universal Modern Industries which gained 0.09 dinars to 1.79 dinars.

The market's improved performance pulled in its trial other speculative stock such as Livestock and Poultry which rose 0.03 dinars, with 292,200 stocks exchanging hands.

Amongst the busiest traded were two bluechip drug firms, Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Arab Pharmaceutical Chemicals, with a 180 fils rise to 3.82 dinars in high 252,977 dinars turnover and a 0.08 dinars gain to 1.62 dinars in 129,020 dinars turnover respectively.

In across the board advances, 42 stocks rose while only 2 declined. Another 10 traded but closed unchanged.
