<p>Jordanian stocks rallied at start of weekly trade on Saturday to 11-month highs after new Jordanian overtures towards Iraq bolstered investor sentiment, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Amman Financial Market 60-share index rose 0.91 percent to 155.11 points, its highest level since late February, in one of the year's heaviest trading days with a turnover worth 2.12 million dinars ($3 million).</p>
<p>Brokers said investor morale was boosted after King Hussein's surprise meeting on Friday with Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf -- the first such high-level meeting since Amman turned against Baghdad and allowed an Iraqi opposition group to open an office in Amman.</p>
<p>The market has been steadily reversing its 1996 declines since news broke out last month of Iraq's near implemetation of its oil-for food deal which the business community hopes could activate stagnant industrial sectors and improve next year's performance of blue-chip firms exporting to Iraq.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was led by key industrials that stand to benefit from exporting to Iraq under the deal. Drug firms that are widely believed to have a competitive advantage were a particular focus of investor attention.</p>
<p>Amongst firms that were underpinned by investor expectations of Iraq-related performance are Intermediate Petrochemicals which rose 0.06 dinars to 1.19 dinars and Universal Modern Industries which gained 0.09 dinars to 1.79 dinars.</p>
<p>The market's improved performance pulled in its trial other speculative stock such as Livestock and Poultry which rose 0.03 dinars, with 292,200 stocks exchanging hands.</p>
<p>Amongst the busiest traded were two bluechip drug firms, Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Arab Pharmaceutical Chemicals, with a 180 fils rise to 3.82 dinars in high 252,977 dinars turnover and a 0.08 dinars gain to 1.62 dinars in 129,020 dinars turnover respectively.</p>
<p>In across the board advances, 42 stocks rose while only 2 declined. Another 10 traded but closed unchanged.</p>
