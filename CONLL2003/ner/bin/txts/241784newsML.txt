Gulf Arab leaders start summit, Bahrain boycotts.

DOHA 1996-12-07

Gulf Arab leaders on Saturday started their annual summit with Bahrain carrying out a threat to boycott the December 7-9 meeting due to a border dispute and spy row with Qatar.

The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) was formed in 1981 by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar as a political and economic alliance which controls almost half of the world's proven oil reserves.
