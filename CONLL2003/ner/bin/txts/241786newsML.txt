EU envoy arrives in Cairo.

CAIRO 1996-12-07

The European Union's Middle East envoy arrived in Cairo on Saturday for talks with Egyptian officials as part of a regional tour to discuss the peace process.

Airport sources reported the arrival of Miguel Angel Moratinos, who is also Spain's ambassador to Israel. Egyptian newspapers reported that the Spanish envoy would hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Sunday.

He is also due to meet Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.

Moratinos was in Damascus on Saturday, where officials said Syria wanted to resume peace talks with Israel but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should honour the outcome of talks held with his predecessor.

Israel's new prime minister angered Arabs by rejecting the land-for-peace formula which was the basis of the U.S.-brokered peace talks.

Moratinos had talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli officials before his visit to Syria.

The EU appointed Moratinos in October to rescue the faltering Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
