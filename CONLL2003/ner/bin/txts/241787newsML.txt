Bahrain denies Qatar's torture report.

MANAMA 1996-12-07

Bahrain on Saturday denied that two Qataris arrested on spy charges had been tortured and said they were being well treated.

"Both defendants are well treated and have reiterated that before the court when they were asked in the first session," an official source at the office of Bahrain's prosecutor general was quoted by the official Gulf News Agency as saying.

The official said the two defendants -- Fahad Hamad Abdullah al-Baker and Salwa Jassim Mohammed Fakhri -- had chosen their two lawyers to defend them.

Qatar on Friday accused Bahrain of torturing al-Baker and said the trial of the Qatari suspects "set a dangerous precedent in Gulf ties." It said any verdicts by the court would be considered void.

Bahrain's State Security Court on Wednesday adjourned the trial of the Qataris to December 14.

The charges have raised tensions between Bahrain and Qatar, already at loggerheads over small islands in the Gulf controlled by Bahrain since the 1930's.

Bahrain boycotted a Gulf Arab summit due to open in the Qatari capital Doha on Saturday.
