<text>
<p>Bahrain on Saturday denied that two Qataris arrested on spy charges had been tortured and said they were being well treated.</p>
<p>&quot;Both defendants are well treated and have reiterated that before the court when they were asked in the first session,&quot; an official source at the office of Bahrain's prosecutor general was quoted by the official Gulf News Agency as saying.</p>
<p>The official said the two defendants -- Fahad Hamad Abdullah al-Baker and Salwa Jassim Mohammed Fakhri -- had chosen their two lawyers to defend them.</p>
<p>Qatar on Friday accused Bahrain of torturing al-Baker and said the trial of the Qatari suspects &quot;set a dangerous precedent in Gulf ties.&quot; It said any verdicts by the court would be considered void.</p>
<p>Bahrain's State Security Court on Wednesday adjourned the trial of the Qataris to December 14.</p>
<p>The charges have raised tensions between Bahrain and Qatar, already at loggerheads over small islands in the Gulf controlled by Bahrain since the 1930's.</p>
<p>Bahrain boycotted a Gulf Arab summit due to open in the Qatari capital Doha on Saturday.</p>
