Yemen formally asks to join GCC - official.

SANAA 1996-12-07

Yemen on Saturday formally asked to join the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a regional political and economic alliance grouping six Gulf states, a Yemeni official said.

President Ali Abdullah Saleh included the request in a letter handed to Qatar's Crown Prince, Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, hours before the GCC was to open its annual summit in Doha, he added.

Yemen's Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Abdullah Ahmad Ghanem gave him the letter, he said.

"Yemen is part and parcel of the Gulf area and this is dictated by the logic of history and geography. Hence this necessitates Yemen joining the bloc," said the official.

"What affects our brethren in the Gulf affects us and reflects on us, whether positively or negatively".

Yemeni officials have in recent years repeatedly expressed interest in joining the GCC which groups Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain.

Impoverished Yemen's ties with GCC states, especially Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, were damaged because of Sanaa's perceived sympathy with Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

Relations with Saudi Arabia, currently engaged in talks with Yemen to settle a 60-year-old border row, have gradually improved since then, but strains persist with Kuwait.

Yemeni sources said last month their country's bid to join the GCC had received encouraging responses from Qatar, the UAE and Oman.

Yemen joined Jordan, Egypt and Iraq in a short-lived Arab Cooperation Council, an economic and political alliance which ended in acrimony after the Gulf crisis.
