<p>Yemen on Saturday formally asked to join the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a regional political and economic alliance grouping six Gulf states, a Yemeni official said.</p>
<p>President Ali Abdullah Saleh included the request in a letter handed to Qatar's Crown Prince, Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, hours before the GCC was to open its annual summit in Doha, he added.</p>
<p>Yemen's Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Abdullah Ahmad Ghanem gave him the letter, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yemen is part and parcel of the Gulf area and this is dictated by the logic of history and geography. Hence this necessitates Yemen joining the bloc,&quot; said the official.</p>
<p>&quot;What affects our brethren in the Gulf affects us and reflects on us, whether positively or negatively&quot;.</p>
<p>Yemeni officials have in recent years repeatedly expressed interest in joining the GCC which groups Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain.</p>
<p>Impoverished Yemen's ties with GCC states, especially Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, were damaged because of Sanaa's perceived sympathy with Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.</p>
<p>Relations with Saudi Arabia, currently engaged in talks with Yemen to settle a 60-year-old border row, have gradually improved since then, but strains persist with Kuwait.</p>
<p>Yemeni sources said last month their country's bid to join the GCC had received encouraging responses from Qatar, the UAE and Oman.</p>
<p>Yemen joined Jordan, Egypt and Iraq in a short-lived Arab Cooperation Council, an economic and political alliance which ended in acrimony after the Gulf crisis.</p>
