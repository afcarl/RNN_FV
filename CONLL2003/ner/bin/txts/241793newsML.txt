Tunisian workers called to give one-day salary.

TUNIS 1996-12-07

A Tunisian trade union organisation on Saturday called on the country's workers to donate a one-day salary to a national solidarity fund sponsored by Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.

The fund, also called "26/26", was set up at the end of 1992 to finance the introduction of water supply, health, electricity and schools in the poorest areas and help their inhabitants develop businesses.

The General Union of Tunisian Workers (UGTT) made the appeal to contribute to the fund at the end of a special meeting of its executive committee.

Between 1993 and 1995, the fund's expenditures amounted to 118.7 million dinars, 90 million of which were from state budget resources and 28.7 million dinars from private donations.
