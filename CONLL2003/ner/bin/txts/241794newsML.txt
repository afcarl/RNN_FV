Israeli firms will set up stall next week at a Jordanian arms show selling high-tech weapons to special forces in the Middle East, organisers said on Saturday.

Three Israeli companies will join exhibitors from 20 countries to offer Arab and Israeli security forces help with fighting insurgence and organised crime.

"It is the first time there has been a military exhibition in the Kingdom of Jordan," said Julian Winkley, spokesman for the exhibition, which opens on Monday. "We are expecting a very large turnout."

Israeli participation in the military show touches a raw nerve in Jordan, where opposition groups are already loudly protesting plans for an Israeli trade fair next month.

But Winkley said Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 ending a 46-year state of war, welcomed participation from the Jewish state.

"It's part of the peace process," he told reporters.

One of the Israeli companies exhibiting at the show makes leather goods including holsters, belts and webbing. The others are part of a weapons training company, specialising in anti-terrorist action.

Exhibitors from Israel's former Arab foes include a firm from the Gulf state of Qatar, showing off a weapons system mount, and one from the United Arab Emirates, selling U.S. vehicles made under licence in Dubai.

Winkley said the exhibition was aimed at providing the latest equipment "that would be of use to special forces in under-pressure situations such as border control, counter-insurgency and anti-terrorist operations."

On offer next week will be personal and vehicle armour, "self-protection equipment, rapid reaction transport vehicles, specialised tools for anti-terrorist and anti-drug work and specialised weaponry."

Weapons up to the size of a light machine gun will be on offer and a small firing range had been set up by the exhibition hall for interested customers, he said.

"This part of the world has shown itself to be very violent in the past," Winkley said. "(The exhibition) is about protecting society."

Exhibition revenue will go towards Jordan's Special Operations Command to help it stock up on equipment, he added.
