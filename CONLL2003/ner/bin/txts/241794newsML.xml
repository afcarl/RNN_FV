<p>Israeli firms will set up stall next week at a Jordanian arms show selling high-tech weapons to special forces in the Middle East, organisers said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Three Israeli companies will join exhibitors from 20 countries to offer Arab and Israeli security forces help with fighting insurgence and organised crime.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the first time there has been a military exhibition in the Kingdom of Jordan,&quot; said Julian Winkley, spokesman for the exhibition, which opens on Monday. &quot;We are expecting a very large turnout.&quot;</p>
<p>Israeli participation in the military show touches a raw nerve in Jordan, where opposition groups are already loudly protesting plans for an Israeli trade fair next month.</p>
<p>But Winkley said Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 ending a 46-year state of war, welcomed participation from the Jewish state.</p>
<p>&quot;It's part of the peace process,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>One of the Israeli companies exhibiting at the show makes leather goods including holsters, belts and webbing. The others are part of a weapons training company, specialising in anti-terrorist action.</p>
<p>Exhibitors from Israel's former Arab foes include a firm from the Gulf state of Qatar, showing off a weapons system mount, and one from the United Arab Emirates, selling U.S. vehicles made under licence in Dubai.</p>
<p>Winkley said the exhibition was aimed at providing the latest equipment &quot;that would be of use to special forces in under-pressure situations such as border control, counter-insurgency and anti-terrorist operations.&quot;</p>
<p>On offer next week will be personal and vehicle armour, &quot;self-protection equipment, rapid reaction transport vehicles, specialised tools for anti-terrorist and anti-drug work and specialised weaponry.&quot;</p>
<p>Weapons up to the size of a light machine gun will be on offer and a small firing range had been set up by the exhibition hall for interested customers, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This part of the world has shown itself to be very violent in the past,&quot; Winkley said. &quot;(The exhibition) is about protecting society.&quot;</p>
<p>Exhibition revenue will go towards Jordan's Special Operations Command to help it stock up on equipment, he added.</p>
