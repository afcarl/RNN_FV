Lebanon former warlord's fourth trial opened.

BEIRUT 1996-12-07

Former Lebanese Christian warlord Samir Geagea has gone on trial on charges of ordering a 1991 attempt to assassinate a government minister, justice officials said.

Geagea, already serving two life sentences for previous murder convictions, faced Lebanon's highest court, the Judicial Council, for five hours on Friday for the car-bomb attempt on then defence minister Michel el-Murr.

The trial was adjourned to December 13.

Prosecutors have demanded the death penalty for Geagea, who headed the strongest Christian civil war militia, the Lebanese Forces (LF), and 11 followers, of whom only one is in custody.

The car bomb exploded as Murr's motorcade passed in an east Beirut suburb, killing eight people and slightly wounding Murr, who is now deputy prime minister and interior minister.

Geagea, the first of the 1975-90 civil war chieftains to stand trial, is serving life sentences for the 1990 murders of Christian political leader Dany Chamoun and his family and the murder in the same year of one of the LF's founders.

But Geagea was acquitted in the case of a 1994 church bombing that killed 11 people.

In August, Geagea was charged with ordering the 1987 murder of then prime minister Rashid Karami by a remote-controlled bomb in his helicopter. No date has been set for that trial.

The government ordered a general amnesty when the civil war ended but postwar crimes and certain high-profile killings like the Karami killing which had been already referred to the Judicial Council were excluded.
