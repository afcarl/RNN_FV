Bahrain arrests five, frees others detainees.

MANAMA 1996-12-07

Bahrain has freed several people detained in connection with anti-governemnt protests under a pardon ahead of the Gulf Arab state's independence silver jubilee, residents said on Saturday.

The releases were part of a pardon by the Emir Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa before the December 16 national celebration, they said. They gave no details.

Residents also said police seized at least five people in Manama on Thursday in an attempt to foil a planned demonstration to mark the second anniversary of unrest which erupted among members of its Shi'ite Moslem community demanding political and economic reforms in December 1994.

The Interior Ministry said on Friday four masked people set fire to a cold store last Sunday in Sitra, a small island linked with Manama by a three km (two mile) causeway, causing damage but no casualties.

"...They set the store on fire after pouring petrol inside it. They ran away and fire destroyed part of the building and everthing inside," the ministry said.

It was not immediately clear whether the incident was linked to the unrest.

At least 25 people, including three policemen, have been killed in the dissent.

The authorities responded to disturbances with mass arrests and by setting up state security courts to ensure speedy punishment ranging from one-year jail sentences to execution.

Bahrain has announced the execution of one person.
