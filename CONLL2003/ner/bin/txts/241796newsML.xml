<text>
<p>Bahrain has freed several people detained in connection with anti-governemnt protests under a pardon ahead of the Gulf Arab state's independence silver jubilee, residents said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The releases were part of a pardon by the Emir Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa before the December 16 national celebration, they said. They gave no details.</p>
<p>Residents also said police seized at least five people in Manama on Thursday in an attempt to foil a planned demonstration to mark the second anniversary of unrest which erupted among members of its Shi'ite Moslem community demanding political and economic reforms in December 1994.</p>
<p>The Interior Ministry said on Friday four masked people set fire to a cold store last Sunday in Sitra, a small island linked with Manama by a three km (two mile) causeway, causing damage but no casualties.</p>
<p>&quot;...They set the store on fire after pouring petrol inside it. They ran away and fire destroyed part of the building and everthing inside,&quot; the ministry said.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether the incident was linked to the unrest.</p>
<p>At least 25 people, including three policemen, have been killed in the dissent.</p>
<p>The authorities responded to disturbances with mass arrests and by setting up state security courts to ensure speedy punishment ranging from one-year jail sentences to execution.</p>
<p>Bahrain has announced the execution of one person.</p>
