Societe Tunisienne de Reassurance (Tunis-Re) plans to offer 700,000 shares at 10 dinars each as part of its plans to raise capital.

Existing shareholders can subscribe at the rate of seven new shares for 15 old shares, from December 9 to 23. The remaining shares will be offered to the public starting January 2.

The operation will raise Tunis-Re's capital to 22 million dinars from 15 million dinars and the company said it has plans to further raise its capital to 35 million dinars.

Tunis-Re was launched in 1981 with the government owning 10 percent, Tunisian insurance companies 42 percent and Tunisian banks 48 percent.

It said earlier that in parallel to the capital raising, it would issue negotiable investment certificates. No date has yet been announced.

The firm is one of the five off-shore reinsurance firms established in Tunisia. ($=one dinar) Tunis newsroom -- 2161-787538
