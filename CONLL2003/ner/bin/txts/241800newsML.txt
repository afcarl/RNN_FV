Arafat challenges Kuwait to prove PLO pro-Iraqi.

DUBAI 1996-12-07

Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, in remarks published on Saturday, challenged Kuwait to prove its assertion that the PLO supported Iraq during the 1990-91 Gulf conflict.

"I challenge them (the Kuwaitis) to prove that I stood by Iraq and supported the invasion of Kuwait," he told the London-based al-Hayat newspaper in an interview during a visit to Saudi Arabia this week.

Asked to comment on Kuwaiti claims that the Palestinian community in Kuwait supported the Iraqi army during the invasion, he said:  "I challenge that this talk is true, I challenge anyone who can prove that."

Kuwait, a member of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, was angered by Arafat's perceived sympathy for Baghdad during Iraq's seven-month occupation of Kuwait and severed ties with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).

It has rejected all PLO calls over the last several years to put aside differences and take back Palestinians expelled from Kuwait in the crisis.

The PLO, like Jordan, Yemen and Sudan refused to back a U.S.-led western military alliance that liberated Kuwait. Instead, they advocated an Arab solution to the crisis and demanded Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.

"I supported the Arab solution. We were, I believe, the only one to offer a proposal on August 30, 1990...The first article of it asked the Iraqi forces to withdraw from Kuwait".

Asked whether he was willing to apologise to Kuwait, a key demand to improving ties with the Gulf Arab state, Arafat said:

"Should I apologise for the humiliation the Palestinians suffered or should I apologise for the expulsion of 440,000 Palestinians from Kuwait."

Palestinians in Kuwait say over 300,000 compatriots, many carrying Jordanian passports, were forced to flee Kuwait because of the crisis.

Arafat, who maintains cordial ties with Baghdad, also said he helped free 33 Kuwaiti prisoners of war held in Iraqi jails in an attempt to improve ties with Kuwait.

Kuwait says Baghdad is still holding about 600 Kuwaitis and people of other nationalities missing since the conflict. Iraq officially denies it.
