<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, in remarks published on Saturday, challenged Kuwait to prove its assertion that the PLO supported Iraq during the 1990-91 Gulf conflict.</p>
<p>&quot;I challenge them (the Kuwaitis) to prove that I stood by Iraq and supported the invasion of Kuwait,&quot; he told the London-based al-Hayat newspaper in an interview during a visit to Saudi Arabia this week.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on Kuwaiti claims that the Palestinian community in Kuwait supported the Iraqi army during the invasion, he said:  &quot;I challenge that this talk is true, I challenge anyone who can prove that.&quot;</p>
<p>Kuwait, a member of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, was angered by Arafat's perceived sympathy for Baghdad during Iraq's seven-month occupation of Kuwait and severed ties with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).</p>
<p>It has rejected all PLO calls over the last several years to put aside differences and take back Palestinians expelled from Kuwait in the crisis.</p>
<p>The PLO, like Jordan, Yemen and Sudan refused to back a U.S.-led western military alliance that liberated Kuwait. Instead, they advocated an Arab solution to the crisis and demanded Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.</p>
<p>&quot;I supported the Arab solution. We were, I believe, the only one to offer a proposal on August 30, 1990...The first article of it asked the Iraqi forces to withdraw from Kuwait&quot;.</p>
<p>Asked whether he was willing to apologise to Kuwait, a key demand to improving ties with the Gulf Arab state, Arafat said:</p>
<p>&quot;Should I apologise for the humiliation the Palestinians suffered or should I apologise for the expulsion of 440,000 Palestinians from Kuwait.&quot;</p>
<p>Palestinians in Kuwait say over 300,000 compatriots, many carrying Jordanian passports, were forced to flee Kuwait because of the crisis.</p>
<p>Arafat, who maintains cordial ties with Baghdad, also said he helped free 33 Kuwaiti prisoners of war held in Iraqi jails in an attempt to improve ties with Kuwait.</p>
<p>Kuwait says Baghdad is still holding about 600 Kuwaitis and people of other nationalities missing since the conflict. Iraq officially denies it.</p>
