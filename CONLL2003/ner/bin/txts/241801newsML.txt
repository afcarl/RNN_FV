Arafat arrives in Cairo for talks with Mubarak.

CAIRO 1996-12-07

Palestinian President Yasser Arafat arrived in Cairo on Saturday for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the Middle East peace process.

Airport sources reported Arafat's arrival. Egyptian television said Arafat would also meet Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa during his short visit to discuss Moussa's talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week in Lisbon.

Both Arafat and Netanyahu have expressed willingness to meet. They last met in Washington after clashes in September that killed 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis. The violence was spurred by Israel's opening an entrance to a tunnel near Moslem sites in Jerusalem.

Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) negotiators said the last two weeks of talks with Israel on implementing the long-delayed handover of most of Hebron to PLO rule had been "meaningless".
