BAGHDAD 1996-12-07

A Russian minister is in Baghdad to examine the humanitarian situation in Iraq and assess the impact of U.N. trade sanctions on the Iraqi people.

Sources at the Russian embassy said that Sergei Shoigu, Russia's minister of civil defence and emergencies, had with him three truckloads of medicial supplies which he presented to Iraq's health ministry on Saturday.

Speaking to reporters, Shoigu said: "I have come to Iraq to see for myself the emergency and humanitarian situation particularly in the medical field."

Shoigu met Iraq's Health Minister Umeed Medhat Mubarak and is expected to see other senior Iraqi officials before winding up his visit on Saturday.

He said he was carrying a "verbal message to Iraqi leadership" from the Russian government. He did not elaborate.

Iraq has agreed to U.N. conditions allowing it partial oil exports of $2 billion every six months to buy food and medicine for its sanctions-hit population.
