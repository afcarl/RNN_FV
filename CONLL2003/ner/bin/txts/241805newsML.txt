Some 400 businessmen from 25 European and Mediterranean countries called on the World Trade Organisation to set up a multilateral code for investments.

The "Second Euro-Mediteranean summit of businessmen", which wound up in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh on Friday, said in a final statement:

"Aware of the essential role of trade exchange and private investment to strengthen the Euro-Mediterranean economic relations, delegates...urgently call on the first ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Singapore to implement the (GATT) commitments of Marrakesh and set up a multilateral code of investments."

The WTO conference, expected to meet in Singapore next week, will discuss issues pending since the meeting of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs in Marrakesh in 1994.

The businessmen's meeting said it aimed to create conditions for establishing a zone of prosperity, stability and cooperation among the countries bordering the Mediterranean.

It also called for:

- Regular contacts between the associations of Euro- Mediterranean business managers and the European Commission,

- Close collaboration between employers' organisations of Europe and those on the southern Mediterranean bank.

The Marrakesh meeting decided to set up a North African business federation linking businessmen from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt. It will include Mauritania later.

The next Euro-Mediterranean businessmen's conference will be held in Greece in 1997, officials said.
