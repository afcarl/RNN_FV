Gulf Arab leaders meeting in Qatar on Saturday are expected to discuss growing concern in the region over Iran's arms programme and policies, diplomats said.

The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states "would never be first in voicing enmity towards Iran...but they see Iran as the coming danger and that there could be a problem sooner or later," said a senior Arab diplomat.

The GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Oman and Qatar -- are due to begin their annual summit in Doha at 1700 GMT.

Although a few GCC states such as Oman have good ties with non-Arab Iran across the Gulf waterway, others have difficult relations with Tehran and are suspicious of its intentions, Arab and Western diplomats said.

The UAE and Iran are locked in a territorial dispute over three Gulf islands.

GCC sources told Reuters that U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry shared with some Gulf Arab states intelligence on Iran's arms programme during a regional tour last week.

"You can say the tour was not only to discuss Iraq...He (Perry) wanted to come here to fill us in on Iran and the latest intelligence," said a Gulf Arab official.

Perry accused Iran and Kuwait's former occupier Iraq of seeking to control the region's oil, about 70 percent of world reserves.

In Riyadh Perry's talks covered possible links between Iran and last November's bombing in eastern Saudi Arabia which killed 19 U.S. airmen. Iran has denied any connection.

"It seems all the evidence available so far is circumstantial and there is no hard and concrete evidence to directly link Iran to the attack," said a Gulf Arab official.

Diplomatic sources in the region say Saudi Arabia had arrested about 40 suspects, some believed to be Moslem militants, in connection with the bombing.

"The (Saudi) investigation is not over. We have to wait and see the final outcome," the official said.
