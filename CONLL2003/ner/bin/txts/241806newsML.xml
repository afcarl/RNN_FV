<p>Gulf Arab leaders meeting in Qatar on Saturday are expected to discuss growing concern in the region over Iran's arms programme and policies, diplomats said.</p>
<p>The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states &quot;would never be first in voicing enmity towards Iran...but they see Iran as the coming danger and that there could be a problem sooner or later,&quot; said a senior Arab diplomat.</p>
<p>The GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Oman and Qatar -- are due to begin their annual summit in Doha at 1700 GMT.</p>
<p>Although a few GCC states such as Oman have good ties with non-Arab Iran across the Gulf waterway, others have difficult relations with Tehran and are suspicious of its intentions, Arab and Western diplomats said.</p>
<p>The UAE and Iran are locked in a territorial dispute over three Gulf islands.</p>
<p>GCC sources told Reuters that U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry shared with some Gulf Arab states intelligence on Iran's arms programme during a regional tour last week.</p>
<p>&quot;You can say the tour was not only to discuss Iraq...He (Perry) wanted to come here to fill us in on Iran and the latest intelligence,&quot; said a Gulf Arab official.</p>
<p>Perry accused Iran and Kuwait's former occupier Iraq of seeking to control the region's oil, about 70 percent of world reserves.</p>
<p>In Riyadh Perry's talks covered possible links between Iran and last November's bombing in eastern Saudi Arabia which killed 19 U.S. airmen. Iran has denied any connection.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems all the evidence available so far is circumstantial and there is no hard and concrete evidence to directly link Iran to the attack,&quot; said a Gulf Arab official.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources in the region say Saudi Arabia had arrested about 40 suspects, some believed to be Moslem militants, in connection with the bombing.</p>
<p>&quot;The (Saudi) investigation is not over. We have to wait and see the final outcome,&quot; the official said.</p>
