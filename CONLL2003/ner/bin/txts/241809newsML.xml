<p>Syria has told the European Union's Middle East envoy it wants to resume peace talks with Israel but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should honour the outcome of talks held with his predecessor, officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>They said Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara told Miguel Angel Moratinos during talks in Damascus on Friday night Syria was keen to reach a just and comprehensive peace with Israel on the basis of U.N. resolutions and the land-for-peace principle.</p>
<p>&quot;The minister affirmed that talks should resume from the point where they ended with the previous Israeli government,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>Israel's new prime minister angered Arabs by rejecting the land-for-peace formula which was the basis of the U.S.-brokered peace talks.</p>
<p>Syria said the former Labour-led government which was defeated by Netanyahu in May elections had agreed to withdraw fully from the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967. Israel denied that.</p>
<p>Syria has held sporadic peace talks with israel since 1991 but the negotiations were stalled over the fate of the Golan. The former Israeli government said publicly it was ready for territorial concessions in the Golan in return for full peace.</p>
<p>No talks were held between Syria and Israel since Netanyahu took office in June. Israel's previous government broke off the negotiations in March following a wave of Islamic suicide bombings in which 59 people were killed in Israel.</p>
<p>Moratinos, Spain's ambassador to Israel, left Damascus on Saturday after a short visit to Syria. He had talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli officials before coming to Syria.</p>
<p>The EU appointed Moratinos in October to rescue the faltering Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.</p>
<p>The envoy told Reuters in Damascus on Friday that Israel wanted to resume talks with Damascus as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Last week in Spain Netanyahu was vague on the possibility of territorial compromise with Syria over the Golan Heights which Israel captured from Damascus in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>&quot;I have not ruled out a territorial discussion,&quot; Netanyahu told reporters in Madrid.</p>
<p>But Syria's official media resumed its attacks on Netanyahu on Saturday and urged Arabs to sever ties with his government.</p>
<p>Ameed Khouli of the official daily al-Thawra said Netanyahu was driving the region to the verge of war because of what he called the Israeli premier's extreme policies.</p>
