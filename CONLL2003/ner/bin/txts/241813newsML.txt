Saudi media hopes Albright will help Mideast peace.

DUBAI 1996-12-07

Saudi Arabian newspapers said on Saturday they hoped Madeleine Albright, nominated as the new U.S. Secretary of State, would direct Washington's policy in line with Arab-Israeli peace accords.

"What concerns us in the Middle East is to have the U.S. continue efforts to push forward Arab-Israeli peace talks in light of U.S. President Bill Clinton's continued commitment to realising peace in this region," wrote the Ukaz daily.

"Albright, in view of her past position (U.S. envoy to the United Nations), knows what running away from implementing agreements and following international law means," added the Arabic daily. "In her new post, she has all means to pressure parties who do not want to stick to international law."

Another newspaper, al-Bilad, said selection of the outspoken Albright could signal tougher policies to come "based on the reasoning that leaving all these world issues without a solution would some day bounce back on the United States".

Saudi Arabia, like most Arab states, wants Washington to intensify efforts to revive the Middle East peace process.
