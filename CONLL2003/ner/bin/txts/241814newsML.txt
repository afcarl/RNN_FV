Iran launches exercises for ground forces.

DUBAI 1996-12-07

Iran's ground forces have begun a week-long military exercise in southeast Iran, the official Iranian news agency IRNA said late on Friday.

Some 6,000 troops from the 88th Armoured Army Division of Sistan and Baluchestan province, backed by airborne divisions, tanks and artillery, are taking part in "tactical and operational" wargames codenamed Fath (victory), it added.

The exercise aims at "maintaining and increasing the combat capability, coordination, proficiency and skill of the participating forces", IRNA added.

It comes days after Iran concluded 10 days of manoeuvres in the Gulf involving 40 planes, helicopters and some 100 ships, as well as Iran's two Russian-built submarines.

The exercise raised concern inside and outside the oil-rich region.

Iran's navy commander last month condemned the Western military presence in the Gulf as "a kind of occupation" but said Iran's exercise "does not challenge anyone and does not signal any tension".
