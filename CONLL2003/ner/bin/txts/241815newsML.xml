<p>President Clinton enjoyed the colourful hoopla of the 97th Army-Navy football game on Saturday maintaining a strict neutrality between the two rival service academies.</p>
<p>The annual contest between the Army Cadets and the Navy Midshipmen, always the biggest game of the season for the two teams, was particularly important this year because the winner goes to the Independence Bowl. Not since 1963 had both Army (9-1) and Navy (8-2) entered the game with winning records.</p>
<p>Army hung on to defeat Navy 28-24 in a driving rain and a soaked Clinton presented the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy to Army coach Bob Sutton and his jubilant players.</p>
<p>The game telecast was beamed by satellite to sevice personnel abroad.</p>
<p>Clinton was the first president to attend the game since Gerald Ford in 1974. He followed a protocol that required him to sit on the home team side during the first half -- in this case Navy -- then move to the visitor side -- Army -- for the second half.</p>
<p>Sitting on Navy side, Clinton helped the Midshipmen sail to a 21-13 halftime lead.</p>
<p>But when he crossed over to Army, the cadets took control.</p>
<p>In keeping with a neutral stance he wore a button with a purple  border on it to symbolise the armed services' philosophy of &quot;jointness,&quot; purple being the colour arrived at by mixing Army green and Navy blue. Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff representing all the armed services, wore a purple button as well.</p>
<p>Clinton fended off an attempt by Navy officials to coerce him into wearing a Navy ball cap. They handed him the cap soon after his arrival at Veterans Stadium, saying it would protect him from a steady drizzle, but he told them he planned to wear the brown, wide-brimmed hat he bought during a recent trip to Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;He could tell he was being set up,&quot; a White House spokesman, Army Col. Jim Fettig, told reporters.</p>
<p>Admiral Charles Larson, superintendent of the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, hailed Clinton for his &quot;sense of fairness.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Clinton told the group of senior Navy and Army officials who greeted him on arrival that he had been invited to the big game every year and was glad he could make it this year.</p>
<p>Army Secretary Togo West tossed in a partisan comment, telling the president, &quot;This was the right year to come,&quot; since Army -- the United States Military Academy of West Point, New York -- was favoured to win the game.</p>
<p>But once he was situated in his seat, a large presidential seal in front of him, Clinton donned a Navy dress cap briefly and saluted for the cameras.</p>
<p>Cannon blasts punctuated the various important moments of the game, shaking the foundation of the sold-out stadium, and the rival crowds cheered wildly.</p>
