President Bill Clinton on Saturday said his four-year effort to "end welfare as we know it" has paid off with big declines in welfare rolls, saying there were 2.1 million fewer people receiving it than when he first took office.

However, in his weekly radio address, the president made no reference to plans he had for changing the landmark welfare reform law he signed last August.

"We were determined to move millions from welfare to work, and our strategy has worked," Clinton said. "I am pleased to announce today that there are now 2.1 million fewer people on welfare than on the day I took the oath of office."

Figures provided by the White House showed that the number of people receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children declined 12 million in September from 14.1 million in January 1993, a decline of 15 percent.

The number of families receiving welfare fell 13 percent to 4.3 million from 4.9 million over the same time period.

Clinton defended the welfare law, which requires recipients to begin working two years after receiving welfare and mandates that 50 percent of single-parent families work 30 hours a week by 2002.

Clinton raised the ire of some Democrats when he signed the Republican-backed legislation. But he pledged to fix what he called "serious flaws." He singled out in particular cuts in food stamps and the curtailment of assistance to many legal immigrants.

While saying in his address that there was still much to do, he did not mention ways he might seek to amend the law.

Last month a New York Times story saying the administration might seek to press changes to welfare as part of budget talks with Congress.

White House spokesman Mike McCurry confirmed officials were studying changes but he offered no specifics and stressed that top-level budget talks have not yet begun.

In Saturday's address, Clinton said the next step was for states to implement the new law. The administration has certified welfare reform plans for four new states -- California, Nebraska, South Dakota and Alabama -- bringing the total number of states with certified plans to 18, he said.

He pledged to protect guarantees of health care, nutrition and child care, and to stiffen child support enforcement.

Clinton also urged business executives to help create one million jobs and hire people off welfare.

"Together we can make the permanent underclass a thing of the past," he said. "Every organisation which employs people should consider hiring someone off welfare, and every state ought to give those organisations the incentives to do so."

During his re-election campaign, Clinton proposed initiatives to give employers $3.43 billion in tax credits for making welfare hires and give states and local authorities $3 billion to work with the private sector and non-profit agencies to create job opportunities.

In the Republican response to Clinton's radio address, Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana called for greater efforts at bipartisanship on priorities such as a balanced, tax reform and improving education.

He said Clinton's re-election on themes of smaller government, family values and strengthening communities gave reasons for hope. "These are fine, noble ideas. In fact, they traditionally have been Republican ideas. And if the president chooses to govern as he campaigned, he will find a cooperative Congress."

The Republican Senator encouraged Clinton to help push for one initiative that Coats himself has proposed, called the Charity Tax Credit, which would allow Americans to direct $500 of what they owe in taxes toward a poverty-fighting charity.

"Think for a moment," Coats said. "Would you rather give your tax dollars to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, or to Habitat for Humanity? To big government, or to Big Brothers/Big Sisters?"
