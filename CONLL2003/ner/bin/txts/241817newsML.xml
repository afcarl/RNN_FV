<p>President Bill Clinton on Saturday said his four-year effort to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot; has paid off with big declines in welfare rolls, saying there were 2.1 million fewer people receiving it than when he first took office.</p>
<p>However, in his weekly radio address, the president made no reference to plans he had for changing the landmark welfare reform law he signed last August.</p>
<p>&quot;We were determined to move millions from welfare to work, and our strategy has worked,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;I am pleased to announce today that there are now 2.1 million fewer people on welfare than on the day I took the oath of office.&quot;</p>
<p>Figures provided by the White House showed that the number of people receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children declined 12 million in September from 14.1 million in January 1993, a decline of 15 percent.</p>
<p>The number of families receiving welfare fell 13 percent to 4.3 million from 4.9 million over the same time period.</p>
<p>Clinton defended the welfare law, which requires recipients to begin working two years after receiving welfare and mandates that 50 percent of single-parent families work 30 hours a week by 2002.</p>
<p>Clinton raised the ire of some Democrats when he signed the Republican-backed legislation. But he pledged to fix what he called &quot;serious flaws.&quot; He singled out in particular cuts in food stamps and the curtailment of assistance to many legal immigrants.</p>
<p>While saying in his address that there was still much to do, he did not mention ways he might seek to amend the law.</p>
<p>Last month a New York Times story saying the administration might seek to press changes to welfare as part of budget talks with Congress.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry confirmed officials were studying changes but he offered no specifics and stressed that top-level budget talks have not yet begun.</p>
<p>In Saturday's address, Clinton said the next step was for states to implement the new law. The administration has certified welfare reform plans for four new states -- California, Nebraska, South Dakota and Alabama -- bringing the total number of states with certified plans to 18, he said.</p>
<p>He pledged to protect guarantees of health care, nutrition and child care, and to stiffen child support enforcement.</p>
<p>Clinton also urged business executives to help create one million jobs and hire people off welfare.</p>
<p>&quot;Together we can make the permanent underclass a thing of the past,&quot; he said. &quot;Every organisation which employs people should consider hiring someone off welfare, and every state ought to give those organisations the incentives to do so.&quot;</p>
<p>During his re-election campaign, Clinton proposed initiatives to give employers $3.43 billion in tax credits for making welfare hires and give states and local authorities $3 billion to work with the private sector and non-profit agencies to create job opportunities.</p>
<p>In the Republican response to Clinton's radio address, Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana called for greater efforts at bipartisanship on priorities such as a balanced, tax reform and improving education.</p>
<p>He said Clinton's re-election on themes of smaller government, family values and strengthening communities gave reasons for hope. &quot;These are fine, noble ideas. In fact, they traditionally have been Republican ideas. And if the president chooses to govern as he campaigned, he will find a cooperative Congress.&quot;</p>
<p>The Republican Senator encouraged Clinton to help push for one initiative that Coats himself has proposed, called the Charity Tax Credit, which would allow Americans to direct $500 of what they owe in taxes toward a poverty-fighting charity.</p>
<p>&quot;Think for a moment,&quot; Coats said. &quot;Would you rather give your tax dollars to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, or to Habitat for Humanity? To big government, or to Big Brothers/Big Sisters?&quot;</p>
