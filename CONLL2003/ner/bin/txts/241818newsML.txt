U.S. shuttle ends record-breaking mission.

The space shuttle Columbia glided to a dawn landing in Florida on Saturday, ending a recording-breaking 18-day mission that was marred by the cancellation of two space walks.

The $2 billion spaceship touched down at the Kennedy Space Centre in the first rays of the morning sun at 6:49 a.m. EST (1149 GMT), just a short distance from the launch pad it blasted off from on Nov. 19.

"It was a fantastic mission," shuttle commander Ken Cockrell said as the shuttle came to a stop on the three-mile (4.8 km) long runway.

Bad weather had delayed the shuttle's return to Earth by two days and propelled the mission into the record books as the longest in the 15-year shuttle programme. Columbia, the oldest of NASA's four shuttles, had set the previous record of 17 days last July.

For veteran astronaut Story Musgrave the landing marked the end of his space flying career. At 61 he was the oldest person to fly in space. After a record-breaking six shuttle flights, NASA has told him not to expect any more.

Also aboard Columbia were pilot Kent Rominger and mission specialists Tom Jones and Tammy Jernigan.

What was to have been a routine 16-day science mission was punctuated by a series of dramas.

Two spacewalks to practice space station assembly were cancelled when the hatch that leads from the shuttle's airlock to the cargo bay refused to open. Astronauts Jernigan and Jones, wearing bulky space suits in the cramped airlock, struggled with the jammed door for two hours without success.

It was the first time in the 15-year shuttle programme that astronauts have encountered problems with the hatch. Technicians will investigate the problem on Tuesday when they gain access to the shuttle's cargo bay.

The deployment of the Wake Shield Facility, a prototype computer chip factory, nearly went awry when the saucer-shaped spacecraft sailed close to the shuttle's cabin.

Cockrell would have fired the shuttle's manoeuvring jets had a collison looked imminent, but the rocket exhaust could have ruined the Wake Shield's work.

The stainless-steel saucer came within 10 feet (3 metres) of the shuttle's cockpit and, although no evasive action was necessary, Cockrell said his heart was in his throat.

The Wake Shield orbited along with a U.S.-German space telescope called Orfeus-Spas, which was released from Columbia eight hours after blastoff.

It was the first time the shuttle had flown in formation with two free-flying spacecraft. Flight director Al Pennington had warned before the flight that it would be "tricky" and he was proved right.

The Astro-Spas began closing in on the Wake Shield and at one point mission control considered ordering the astronauts to pick up the semiconductor factory a day early. It was concerned that Columbia would not have adequate clearance to swoop between the two spacecraft and pick up the Wake Shield.

In the end, the Wake Shield and Orfeus-Spas never came closer than 15 miles (24 km) to each other and the retrieval took place successfully, just a few hours earlier than planned.

Despite its problems, Columbia returned with a bounty of scientific results, NASA officals said.

The Wake Shield, which had not worked properly on its first two flights, appeared to have successfully manufactured ultra-pure semiconductors for the electronics industry.

Astronomers said the Orfeus-Spas telescope had obtained a wealth of new information about the life cycles of stars and the mysterious interstellar matter that lies between them.
