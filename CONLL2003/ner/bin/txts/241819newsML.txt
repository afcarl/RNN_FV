U.S. shuttle crew head home.

The U.S space shuttle Columbia was headed for a Florida homecoming on Saturday to end a record-breaking 18-day mission.

Flying backwards over the Indian Ocean, shuttle commander Ken Cockrell fired the shuttle's twin braking rockets at 5:46 a.m. (1056 GMT) to drop the $2 billion spaceship out of orbit.

The shuttle's hour-long descent through the atmosphere was to end with a touchdown on the Kennedy Space Center's three-mile-long runway at 6:49 a.m. EST (1150 GMT) on its third attempt to land in as many days.

NASA had cancelled the shuttle's landing on Friday because dense fog had blanketed the Kennedy Space Centre and high winds were gusting at the California landing strip. The day before cloudy skies at the Florida spaceport were the problem.

It was only the third time that a shuttle's landing had been postponed for two consecutive days, NASA officials said.

Mission control woke the astronauts on Saturday night with a recording of Sawyer Brown's "Please Come Home For Christmas".

"Good morning, Columbia, and we really do want to have you home for Christmas," mission control's Marc Garneu radioed. "We're all set up to try again today."

The shuttle's extra day in space propelled the mission into the record books as the longest ever in the 15-year shuttle programme.

Columbia's marathon 18-day mission, which began on Nov. 19, was marred by a jammed airlock hatch that forced NASA to cancel a pair of space walks. Astronauts Tammy Jernigan and Tom Jones had spent months training for the space walks, which had been intended to test construction tools for a planned permanent space station.

During the mission, the astronauts released and later retrieved two science satellites. A U.S.-German telescope studied the life cycles of stars and a prototype computer chip factory manufactured ultra-pure semiconductors for the electronics industry.
