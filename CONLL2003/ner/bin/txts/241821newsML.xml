<p>Opponents of a California measure abolishing affirmative action won a legal victory Friday when a federal judge temporarily barred the giant University of California from implementing it.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson granted a request by a number of labour, education and women's business groups and minority organisations to issue a temporary restraining order barring the nine-campus university from implementing Proposition 209, passed by California voters Nov. 5.</p>
<p>The university is bound by the order at least until Dec. 16 when Henderson has scheduled a court hearing to decide whether to issue a preliminary order blocking the state from implementing Proposition 209 until a trial is held on its constitutionality.</p>
<p>In his five-page ruling, Henderson noted the university intended to make undergraduate admissions decisions for the spring term of 1997 before Dec. 16 and also planned to make a number of financial aid awards to graduate students. Both are affected by Proposition 209 since the university would not be able to take race or sex into consideration.</p>
<p>Henderson said he had concluded that plaintiffs &quot;face the prospect of irreparable harm&quot; before Dec. 16 and that a temporary restraining order was appropriate to preserve the status quo until then.</p>
<p>Proposition 209 bars discrimination and preferential treatment based on race or sex in public employment, education and contracting in California, effectively outlawing public affirmative action programmes used since the 1960s to broaden opportunities for minorities and women.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other civil rights groups sued on behalf of the labour, education and business groups a day after the Nov. 5 election, arguing that Proposition 209 was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Proposition 209 had an instant impact on the University of California, which ordered that race and sex be dropped immediately as factors in deciding which students won admission or were awarded financial aid.</p>
<p>University of California spokesman Terry Lightfoot said Friday the university was complying with Henderson's order by advising campuses not to make any admissions or financial aid decisions until the Dec. 16 hearing, which will decide the near-term fate of Proposition 209.</p>
<p>The ACLU praised Henderson's ruling but California Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican and Proposition 209 supporter, slammed it, saying: &quot;We are witnessing a world turned upside down when court decisions such as this not only seek to protect preferential treatment, but thwart the will of the majority of California voters.&quot;</p>
<p>Henderson issued a temporary restraining order last week barring Wilson and state Attorney General Dan Lungren from implementing Proposition 209 at least until Dec. 16, saying there was a strong probability it would be found unconstitutional. But that order technically did not bind state agencies or the University of California.</p>
<p>The university decided last year to scrap race or sex as factors in undergraduate admissions from the spring of 1998, but was forced to move up that timetable by Proposition 209.</p>
