<p>Weeping and glaring at O.J. Simpson, Nicole Brown Simpson's mother testified on Friday that the former football star told her &quot;it's gonna hurt&quot; after a failed reconciliation attempt with his ex-wife.</p>
<p>As Juditha Brown recalled the last time she saw her daughter alive, her husband Lou and another daughter Denise, also cried openly as they sat in the public gallery at Simpson's civil trial.</p>
<p>She said that after a family meal at a restaurant on the evening of June 12, 1994, her daughter Nicole left with her two children and another little girl to get some ice cream.</p>
<p>&quot;They were going across the street. I stopped for some reason and I looked back at her again. I was thinking, 'What a gorgeous girl, what great legs.' Those were my thoughts. That's the last time I saw her alive.&quot;</p>
<p>Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman, were killed later that night by a knife-wielding assailant. Simpson, a former football star turned actor, was acquitted of the murders by a criminal court jury in October, 1995. He is being sued for wrongful death by the families of the victims.</p>
<p>Juditha Brown said the previous month, following a failed reconciliation between Simpson and his ex-wife, Simpson called her and said: &quot;She (Nicole) may not love me any more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I said, 'Well then, go on with your life,'&quot; Juditha Brown told the court. Simpson replied, &quot;I told you the first time she left me I took the blame, it was my fault. The second time it's gonna hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>She said that at her daughter's wake on June 15, three days after the murders, she was standing by the open coffin when Simpson came up and said, &quot;Could you move, could you move? I want to be alone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I heard him say, 'I'm so sorry Nic, I'm so sorry,' and he kissed her on the lips,&quot; Brown recounted.</p>
<p>She said she then confronted him asking, &quot;'Did you have anything to do with this?' and he said, 'I loved your daughter' and that was the end.&quot;</p>
<p>Attorneys for the plaintiffs had planned to end their case on Friday, but as testimony took longer than expected, they said they would wrap it up on Monday with testimony from Goldman's father, Fred.</p>
<p>Juditha Brown said Simpson appeared to be &quot;very angry&quot; on the evening of June 12, 1994, when he attended a dance recital by his daughter, Sydney, with other members of the family.</p>
<p>She said when Simpson approached her at the recital, &quot;he put his hands on his hips and he looked at me and he didn't say a word and he looked through me and I started to feel very uncomfortable and I said 'What's happening?' and he sat down.&quot;</p>
<p>Shown a photo of her daughter from June 8, when Simpson's son, Justin, had graduated from pre-school, Juditha Brown broke down and said, &quot;It was the last picture I ever took.&quot;</p>
<p>She identified the backless, halter-style black dress seen in the photograph as the same one Nicole Brown Simpson was wearing when she was murdered.</p>
<p>Asked if the dress was ever returned to the family, Brown said, &quot;It's still with the D.A.'s (district attorney's) office. It's still bloody, wrapped up.&quot;</p>
<p>The German-born Brown frequently glared at Simpson during her tearful testimony. She said that on the way to her Orange County home following the June 12 recital, &quot;a terrible depression came over me, something I had never experienced before or after. My whole body got heavy. It never happened to me before and never again.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown said she had lost her eyeglasses at the restaurant and called to see if they had been found when she got home. On learning that they had been, she telephoned her daughter and asked her to pick them up.</p>
<p>Nicole Brown Simpson said she would have a friend, Goldman, who worked at the restaurant, deliver them to her. &quot;Then she said, 'Goodnight, I love you,' and I said, 'I love you,' and those were the last words,&quot; Brown said, sobbing.</p>
<p>Brown broke down again when she recalled the call early on June 13. &quot;I was in a deep sleep for some reason and a phone call woke me up and Arnelle (Simpson's eldest daughter by a previous marriage) was on the phone and she was sobbing.</p>
<p>&quot;I knew something had happened to Nicole and then I think it was (detective) Tom Lange who came to the phone and he said, 'Your daughter is dead.'&quot;</p>
