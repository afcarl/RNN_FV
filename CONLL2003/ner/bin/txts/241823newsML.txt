Gasoline truck explodes at California Toyota plant.

FREMONT, Calif 1996-12-06

A gasoline truck exploded and burst into flames Friday as it was delivering fuel to a Toyota Motor Co facility in northern California, fire officials said.

The tanker truck and trailer containing about 9,000 gallons (34,068 litres) of fuel exploded at the Toyota logistics services facility next to the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc (NUMMI) manufacturing plant in Fremont, Fremont fire department spokesman Dennis Satariano said.

The fire sent flames shooting high into the air, witnesses said.

Firefighters sprayed water on three nearby gasoline storage tanks, each containing about 2,000 gallons (7,570 litres) of gasoline, to keep them cool and managed to keep the fire from spreading to the tanks, Satariano said.

It took more than two hours for firefighters, backed by nine fire engines, to put out the fire, he said. The truck was destroyed and two other vehicles damaged, he said.

The tanker truck was offloading gasoline when a hose broke for an unknown reason and gasoline fumes ignited, Satariano said. There was an explosion and fierce fire.

Satariano said the tanker truck driver ran away just before the explosion and no-one was injured.

The Toyota facility adjoins the NUMMI plant, a joint venture between General Motors Corp and Toyota which produces Toyota Corolla and Chevrolet Geo Prizm cars and Toyota Tacoma pickup trucks. It makes about 1,500 vehicles a day.

About 4,700 workers are employed at the NUMMI plant, about 40 miles (70 kms) southeast of San Francisco.

The Toyota logistics facility prepares newly-built Toyota vehicles for delivery.

Bob Wade, a spokesman for Toyota Motor Sales, said the fuel that spilled from the broken hose was apparently ignited by the tanker's engine. Employees of the Toyota facility were immediately evacuated without any reported injuries, he said.

NUMMI spokeswoman Debbie Girard said the fire was not on NUMMI property but did affect production at the plant. "It has affected our production. How much we don't know at this point," she said.
