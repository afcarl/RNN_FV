<p>Seeking to clear up any confusion arising from U.S.-Cuban talks this week, the White House said on Friday U.S. policy was not to send back to Cuba any refugees who entered the United States legally.</p>
<p>But at the same time, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said any Cuban refugee who entered or tried to enter the United States in violation of its immigration law &quot;is subject to exclusion and return&quot; to Cuba.</p>
<p>According to reports from Havana after U.S.-Cuba talks there Wednesday and Thursday, the two countries agreed to work toward an accord under which Washington would repatriate Cubans arriving illegally in the United States, not just those intercepted trying to do so.</p>
<p>But McCurry and State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns --  who called the reports &quot;histrionic&quot; -- sought to clear up what they said was confusion coming out of the talks.</p>
<p>While Washington wants to deter future illegal immigration, McCurry said, it &quot;does not contemplate the repatriation of Cuban nationals who are presently within our borders,&quot; other than those accused of criminal offences and called &quot;excludables.&quot;</p>
<p>Burns said the new element emerging from the talks was that the Cubans indicated &quot;they might be willing to talk about it (the issue of excludables), but they haven't made any firm decisions.&quot;</p>
<p>Since the early 1980s, Washington has talked to Havana about the so-called &quot;excludables...Cubans...who have come to the United States unbeknownst to us with a violent, criminal past -- murderers, rapists -- or Cubans who are in the United States, who have become violent criminals in the United States,&quot; Burns said.</p>
<p>Since 1982, the United States has returned 1,300 of these people to Cuba. But Havana has disputed who constitutes an exludable and often has not wanted to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>Burns said in this week's talks, there was a brief discussion about U.S. interest &quot;in continuing to have a discussion with the Cubans about this issue, and continuing to have this process operate so that violent offenders of our law do not stay here. And that's all that happened.&quot;</p>
<p>Under a bilateral migration accord in May 1995, Washington agreed to send back to Cuba those illegal migrants whom it intercepted trying to get to the United States, whether by boat over the Strait of Florida or by crossing to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay on the southeast tip of Cuba.</p>
<p>Under that agreement, more than 480 illegal Cuban migrants have been sent home by U.S. authorities.</p>
<p>But Cuba has been concerned that those illegal migrants who manage to reach the United States are not returned home. A U.S. official at the Havana talks said Cuba calculated there were more than 100 cases of such Cubans.</p>
<p>McCurry said the United States would require Cuba to give guarantees that it will not punish those Cubans who are sent home for entering the United States illegally or without a valid claim of asylum.</p>
<p>&quot;We seek, and will require, guarantees that no action would be taken against such individuals as a result of their departure from Cuba, and arrangements to monitor their treatment upon return, as is the case with those returned after interception at sea,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The May 1995 accord followed an earlier Cuba-U.S. agreement on migration in September 1994. Both were aimed at halting illegal migration by Cubans to the United States, following the so-called rafter crisis of August and September 1994 in which more than 30,000 Cubans left for Florida on rafts and other flimsy vessels.</p>
<p>The Havana talks were the first official public contact between the two countries -- which do not have diplomatic ties -- since President Clinton was re-elected last month.</p>
