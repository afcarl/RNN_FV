U.S. climate change plan too slow, green groups say.

The United States next week will propose making 2010 the first deadline to meet targets in cutting industrial emissions, which environmentalists Friday blasted as a sluggish response to global warming.

At meetings in Geneva, the United States also will suggest using a system of trading, banking and borrowing of emissions allowances to give countries flexibility to meet targets of reducing carbon emissions that come mainly from burning fossil fuels.

A paper the Clinton administration will offer in negotiations next week said trying to set shorter-term targets "would be unnecessarily burdensome to national and global economic growth and development. (That) could mean that few, if any, countries would ratify the agreement."

The administration, which in July called for an international pact with binding commitments for countries to reduce pollution that is changing the world's climate, also called for countries to continue work on longer term goals 50 to 100 years off.

It also urged negotiators to consider a system of letting countries "borrow" against their targets to let them emit more in a current period and, similarly, to "bank" emissions that were below targets in one period to be used to offset higher emissions later.

Environmental groups said such a borrowing system, coupled with the 2010 startup, could undermine a treaty.

"The proposal would delay the beginning of any legal requirements to reduce greenhouse pollution until at least 2010, and even then emissions could be 'borrowed' from the period after 2020," the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) said in a statement.

"Rather than detailing commitments to protect our children, the staff paper proposes literally borrowing pollution allowances from our children and thereby putting the burden on them," Dan Lashof, NRDC senior scientist, said.

But an industry coalition opposed to a binding treaty said it was pleased the administration "highlighted the growing attention to the economic costs" of measures to fight global warming.

"It is encouraging that the administration apparently shares our concerns regarding impacts on the U.S. economy from poorly developed or premature policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," John Shlaes, executive director of the Global Climate Coalition, said in a statement.

Michael Oppenheimer, the Environmental Defense Fund's chief scientist, said delaying the emissions reductions will only make the process more expensive and complained that the administration did not offer numerical targets and timetables.

A State Department official involved in the negotiations said numerical targets will be proposed later. This paper is to help negotiators next week develop a document on which to base further talks, she said.

The negotiations are scheduled to conclude next December in Kyoto, Japan.

The United States' position calls for a system of trading emissions allowances among countries that were parties to the treaty, and for parties to the treaty to get credit for projects that lower emissions from developing countries not bound by targets.

While industrialized countries are expected to assume most of the burden of reducing emissions, the U.S. position suggested that rapidly developing countries such as South Korea and Mexico should have more responsiblities than countries with less mature economies.
