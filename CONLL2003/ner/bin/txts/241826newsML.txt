NY precious metals end lower, early gains eroded.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06

New York precious metals futures ended lower Friday, after giving back good early gains resulting from sharp falls in world stock and bond markets.

"If it hadn't been for the weak U.S. employment data which tempered the falls in U.S. bonds and stocks, gold may have done better and continued its recovery from last month's slide," said John Brimelow, New York director of international equities for German bank BV Capital.

"But gold lease rates falling back in the last few days, sugggesting short speculative interest may be easing," he said.

U.S. November non-farm payrolls rose only 118,000 against expectations for a 179,000 rise, tempering inflation fears and allowing the U.S. bond market to recover.

"But the Hong Kong tael premium has been up over a $1.00 for the past seven days also, suggesting some revival in physical demand may be occurring in Asia," he said.

COMEX February gold ended down $2.20 an ounce at $370.80 an ounce, but not before jumping overnight to a five day high at $376.10, on comments from U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Greenspans warning about asset price inflation.

Spot gold ended $368.70/369.20, compared to the London Friday afternoon fix at $370.25, but spot gold had fixed at $373.00 Friday morning, up $4.00 from the Thursday afternoon fix at $369.00.

COMEX March silver closed down 8.7 cents at $4.805, after seeing a session high at $4.930 early.

"Gold stocks in the equities markets look undervalued right now also," said Thomas Dorsey president of Dorsey Associates of Virginia and a consultant to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange on their gold and silver stocks index (.XAU) and related and options.

The XAU index was little changed around 121.32 near the close Friday, after recovering in the past few days from four week lows around 114.

Spot gold prices have been recovering in the past two days from a three year low seen Tuesday at $366.00 an ounce, and on the daily charts popular momentum indicators continued to recover, analysts noted.

Short covering by funds with record net short positions in COMEX gold futures may yet carry the correction higher, traders said.

But fears of European central bank gold sales continue to weigh on the market, even though central banks in Portugal and Belgium denied any sales earlier this week.

NYMEX January platinum ended down $2.60 an ounce at $372.70, a new life-of-contract low.

Fears of Russian sales of platinum in the spot market were feared while that country's budget problems delay talks on a 1997 contract price with Japan, analysts said.

NYMEX March palladium ended down just 25 cents at $117.75 an ounce.
