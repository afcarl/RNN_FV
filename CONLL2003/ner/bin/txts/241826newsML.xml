<headline>NY precious metals end lower, early gains eroded.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>New York precious metals futures ended lower Friday, after giving back good early gains resulting from sharp falls in world stock and bond markets.</p>
<p>&quot;If it hadn't been for the weak U.S. employment data which tempered the falls in U.S. bonds and stocks, gold may have done better and continued its recovery from last month's slide,&quot; said John Brimelow, New York director of international equities for German bank BV Capital.</p>
<p>&quot;But gold lease rates falling back in the last few days, sugggesting short speculative interest may be easing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>U.S. November non-farm payrolls rose only 118,000 against expectations for a 179,000 rise, tempering inflation fears and allowing the U.S. bond market to recover.</p>
<p>&quot;But the Hong Kong tael premium has been up over a $1.00 for the past seven days also, suggesting some revival in physical demand may be occurring in Asia,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>COMEX February gold ended down $2.20 an ounce at $370.80 an ounce, but not before jumping overnight to a five day high at $376.10, on comments from U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Greenspans warning about asset price inflation.</p>
<p>Spot gold ended $368.70/369.20, compared to the London Friday afternoon fix at $370.25, but spot gold had fixed at $373.00 Friday morning, up $4.00 from the Thursday afternoon fix at $369.00.</p>
<p>COMEX March silver closed down 8.7 cents at $4.805, after seeing a session high at $4.930 early.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold stocks in the equities markets look undervalued right now also,&quot; said Thomas Dorsey president of Dorsey Associates of Virginia and a consultant to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange on their gold and silver stocks index (.XAU) and related and options.</p>
<p>The XAU index was little changed around 121.32 near the close Friday, after recovering in the past few days from four week lows around 114.</p>
<p>Spot gold prices have been recovering in the past two days from a three year low seen Tuesday at $366.00 an ounce, and on the daily charts popular momentum indicators continued to recover, analysts noted.</p>
<p>Short covering by funds with record net short positions in COMEX gold futures may yet carry the correction higher, traders said.</p>
<p>But fears of European central bank gold sales continue to weigh on the market, even though central banks in Portugal and Belgium denied any sales earlier this week.</p>
<p>NYMEX January platinum ended down $2.60 an ounce at $372.70, a new life-of-contract low.</p>
<p>Fears of Russian sales of platinum in the spot market were feared while that country's budget problems delay talks on a 1997 contract price with Japan, analysts said.</p>
<p>NYMEX March palladium ended down just 25 cents at $117.75 an ounce.</p>
