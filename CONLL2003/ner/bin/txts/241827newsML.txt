McTeer says early U.S. inflation signs reassuring.

U.S. inflation signs in recent months have been reassuring despite tight labor markets that appear to have put some upward pressure on unit labor costs, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said Friday.

Dallas Fed chief Robert McTeer pointed out at a jobs conference here that experiences in the past in which such labor market conditions have led to price rises have caused a number of economists to predict an "imminent inflation breakout."  

"On the other hand, more direct, early indicators of inflation and measures of inflation in the pipeline have been more reassuring in recent months," McTeer said.

The Fed official noted that the overall Consumer Price Index is running at around 3.0 percent this year, up slightly from 2.5 percent last year.

However, he added, "the core CPI has actually improved as have several other measures of inflation."

The U.S. Labor Department early Friday reported that nonfarm payrolls gained 118,000 in November after a rise of 224,000 in October.  

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent in November from 5.2 percent.

McTeer termed the increase in payrolls as "broad-based."

In describing the conditions of the labor market as the jobless rate edged downward this year, he said: "As the slack in the labor force has been used up over the past year, labor markets have become very tight with labor shortages here and there beginning to put upward pressure on wages."

He added, "With wage growth beginning to outstrip gains in labor productivity (it has) put upward pressure on unit labor costs."
