Nixon urged audits of Jewish contributors - report.

SAN FRANCISCO 1996-12-07

Newly-released tapes show President Richard Nixon pushed for tax audits of wealthy Jewish contributors to his Democratic rivals, the San Francisco Examiner reported in its Sunday editions.

The Examiner said the revelation was contained in more than 200 hours of recently-released Nixon White House tapes.

Nixon, who resigned in 1974 after being implicated in a cover-up of a break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate Building, had a hidden system installed to record his conversations.

The conversations took place in September 1971 when Nixon was worried about his re-election prospects, the Examiner said in a copyright story.

In a Sept. 8, 1971, meeting with domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman, the Examiner quoted Nixon as saying: "John, we have the power. Are we using it now to investigate contributors to (defeated 1968 Democratic candidate) Hubert Humphrey, contributors to (then Democratic presidential contender Edmund) Muskie -- the Jews, you know, that are stealing in every direction?"

"Are we going after their tax returns? ...I can only hope that we are, frankly, doing a little persecuting," he said.

Five days later, during a meeting with Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman, Nixon said: "Now here's the point, Bob, please get me the names of the Jews. You know, the big Jewish contributors to the Democrats," he said. Using an expletive to refer to the contributors, he asked to have some of them investigated.

A day later, meeting with Haldeman and political aide Charles Colson, Nixon is quoted as asking: "What about the rich Jews? The IRS is full of Jews, Bob." Later, he added: "Go after 'em like a son of a bitch!"

The Examiner said it could not be determined whether any Jewish Democratic contributors were audited as a result of Nixon's conversations with his aides.

Reacting to the tapes, Robert Strauss, a prominent Democratic fundraiser and a Jew, told the Examiner that "this language coming out of the mouth of a president of the United States is more than I can really comprehend. It's sickening." Strauss was treasurer of the Democratic National Committee in 1971.
