<p>Newly-released tapes show President Richard Nixon pushed for tax audits of wealthy Jewish contributors to his Democratic rivals, the San Francisco Examiner reported in its Sunday editions.</p>
<p>The Examiner said the revelation was contained in more than 200 hours of recently-released Nixon White House tapes.</p>
<p>Nixon, who resigned in 1974 after being implicated in a cover-up of a break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate Building, had a hidden system installed to record his conversations.</p>
<p>The conversations took place in September 1971 when Nixon was worried about his re-election prospects, the Examiner said in a copyright story.</p>
<p>In a Sept. 8, 1971, meeting with domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman, the Examiner quoted Nixon as saying: &quot;John, we have the power. Are we using it now to investigate contributors to (defeated 1968 Democratic candidate) Hubert Humphrey, contributors to (then Democratic presidential contender Edmund) Muskie -- the Jews, you know, that are stealing in every direction?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are we going after their tax returns? ...I can only hope that we are, frankly, doing a little persecuting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Five days later, during a meeting with Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman, Nixon said: &quot;Now here's the point, Bob, please get me the names of the Jews. You know, the big Jewish contributors to the Democrats,&quot; he said. Using an expletive to refer to the contributors, he asked to have some of them investigated.</p>
<p>A day later, meeting with Haldeman and political aide Charles Colson, Nixon is quoted as asking: &quot;What about the rich Jews? The IRS is full of Jews, Bob.&quot; Later, he added: &quot;Go after 'em like a son of a bitch!&quot;</p>
<p>The Examiner said it could not be determined whether any Jewish Democratic contributors were audited as a result of Nixon's conversations with his aides.</p>
<p>Reacting to the tapes, Robert Strauss, a prominent Democratic fundraiser and a Jew, told the Examiner that &quot;this language coming out of the mouth of a president of the United States is more than I can really comprehend. It's sickening.&quot; Strauss was treasurer of the Democratic National Committee in 1971.</p>
