Deadly hotel fire remembered 50 years later.

The deadliest hotel fire in U.S. history was remembered in a memorial service Saturday marking the 50th anniversary of a pre-dawn blaze that killed 119 of 280 guests at the Winecoff Hotel.

The Winecoff was full on Dec. 7, 1946, when a fire began on the third floor and rushed upwards through an open inside stairway adjacent to the elevators.

Many victims jumped from the burning 15-story building because the city's only wooden fire truck ladder reached no higher than the seventh floor.

The hotel, built in 1913, promoted itself as "absolutely fireproof" even though it had no fire escapes, fire walls or sprinkler system. The Winecoff fire prompted cities across the nation to adopt stricter fire regulations for high-rise buildings.

"We hopefully will never again have to face a tragedy of this magnitude in the city of Atlanta or anywhere else in the United States," Deputy Atlanta Fire Chief Joe Tolbert told about 50 people who gathered for the commemoration.

Among those present was Arnold Hardy, a Georgia Tech student who was returning home from a late-night date when he took a Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of a woman jumping to the ground from one of the hotel's upper floors.

"This is a happy day," said Allen Goodwin, co-author of the book "The Winecoff Fire." "We've made it 50 years without a repeat of this."

The downtown hotel, on Peachtree Street, reopened under another name five years after the 1946 fire. The building still stands, but has been vacant since 1981 when it was a residence for the elderly.

Sam Heys, the other co-author of the Winecoff book, said the hotel was filled in 1946 with "out-of-town Christmas shoppers, excited teenagers, and soldiers who had survived the war."

An extra edition of the Atlanta Journal newspaper on the day of the fire described a horrific scene: "Bodies hurtled from upper windows. Dim outlines of trapped guests were seen gesturing wildly in silhouettes in the upper windows. Screams pierced the pre-dawn air as the trapped victims sought wildly to escape."

A hotel fire on Dec. 25, 1971, in Seoul, South Korea, that killed 162 people is believed to be have been the world's deadliest hotel fire.
