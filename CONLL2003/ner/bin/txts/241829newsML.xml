<p>The deadliest hotel fire in U.S. history was remembered in a memorial service Saturday marking the 50th anniversary of a pre-dawn blaze that killed 119 of 280 guests at the Winecoff Hotel.</p>
<p>The Winecoff was full on Dec. 7, 1946, when a fire began on the third floor and rushed upwards through an open inside stairway adjacent to the elevators.</p>
<p>Many victims jumped from the burning 15-story building because the city's only wooden fire truck ladder reached no higher than the seventh floor.</p>
<p>The hotel, built in 1913, promoted itself as &quot;absolutely fireproof&quot; even though it had no fire escapes, fire walls or sprinkler system. The Winecoff fire prompted cities across the nation to adopt stricter fire regulations for high-rise buildings.</p>
<p>&quot;We hopefully will never again have to face a tragedy of this magnitude in the city of Atlanta or anywhere else in the United States,&quot; Deputy Atlanta Fire Chief Joe Tolbert told about 50 people who gathered for the commemoration.</p>
<p>Among those present was Arnold Hardy, a Georgia Tech student who was returning home from a late-night date when he took a Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of a woman jumping to the ground from one of the hotel's upper floors.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a happy day,&quot; said Allen Goodwin, co-author of the book &quot;The Winecoff Fire.&quot; &quot;We've made it 50 years without a repeat of this.&quot;</p>
<p>The downtown hotel, on Peachtree Street, reopened under another name five years after the 1946 fire. The building still stands, but has been vacant since 1981 when it was a residence for the elderly.</p>
<p>Sam Heys, the other co-author of the Winecoff book, said the hotel was filled in 1946 with &quot;out-of-town Christmas shoppers, excited teenagers, and soldiers who had survived the war.&quot;</p>
<p>An extra edition of the Atlanta Journal newspaper on the day of the fire described a horrific scene: &quot;Bodies hurtled from upper windows. Dim outlines of trapped guests were seen gesturing wildly in silhouettes in the upper windows. Screams pierced the pre-dawn air as the trapped victims sought wildly to escape.&quot;</p>
<p>A hotel fire on Dec. 25, 1971, in Seoul, South Korea, that killed 162 people is believed to be have been the world's deadliest hotel fire.</p>
