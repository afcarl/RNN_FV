US Air Force removes commander of Portuguese base.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-07

The Air Force on Saturday said a commander at a U.S. base in Portugal was relieved of his duties pending an investigation but it did not say what the colonel was accused of.

In a statement the Air Force said Col. Melvin Reeves was relieved of his duties as commander of the Lajes Field base on the Azores Islands by Lt. General Phillip Ford.

"Gen. Ford took the action because he lost confidence in Reeves' ability and fitness to command," the statement said, emphasising that the removal did not result from any action toward Portuguese citizens.

A Portuguese newspaper, Diario de Noticias, reported the colonel's removal involved charges of sexual harassment.

An Air Force spokeswoman said she could discuss the nature of the charges, citing a pending investigation which she said is expected to be completed on Dec. 17. In the meantime she said Reeves is serving as a special assistant and retains his title as colonel.

On Friday, in a scandal involving the U.S. Army, three career soldiers were arraigned at a base in Aberdeen, Maryland, on charges involving sexual misconduct toward women under their command, including two men who were accused of rape.
