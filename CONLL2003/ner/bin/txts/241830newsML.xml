<headline>US Air Force removes commander of Portuguese base.</headline>

<text>
<p>The Air Force on Saturday said a commander at a U.S. base in Portugal was relieved of his duties pending an investigation but it did not say what the colonel was accused of.</p>
<p>In a statement the Air Force said Col. Melvin Reeves was relieved of his duties as commander of the Lajes Field base on the Azores Islands by Lt. General Phillip Ford.</p>
<p>&quot;Gen. Ford took the action because he lost confidence in Reeves' ability and fitness to command,&quot; the statement said, emphasising that the removal did not result from any action toward Portuguese citizens.</p>
<p>A Portuguese newspaper, Diario de Noticias, reported the colonel's removal involved charges of sexual harassment.</p>
<p>An Air Force spokeswoman said she could discuss the nature of the charges, citing a pending investigation which she said is expected to be completed on Dec. 17. In the meantime she said Reeves is serving as a special assistant and retains his title as colonel.</p>
<p>On Friday, in a scandal involving the U.S. Army, three career soldiers were arraigned at a base in Aberdeen, Maryland, on charges involving sexual misconduct toward women under their command, including two men who were accused of rape.</p>
