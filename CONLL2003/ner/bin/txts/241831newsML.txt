University to pay millions over murders - report.

MIAMI 1996-12-07

The University of Miami has agreed to pay more than $1 million each to the families of a university football player and a friend who were murdered in his campus apartment in April, the Miami Herald reported Saturday.

The university did not disclose the amount of the settlement, which the newspaper attributed to unnamed sources. It said only that a settlement was reached with the families of Marlin Barnes and Timwanika Lumpkins and that the money would be paid by its liability insurance.

Barnes and Lumpkins were found bludgeoned to death in what was believed to be the university's first on-campus murders.

Lumpkins' former boyfriend, Labrant "Anthony" Dennis, has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the killings.

The settlement avoids public proceedings over whether the university bore any responsibility for the deaths, such as inadequate security, the newspaper said.
