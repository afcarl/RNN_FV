<text>
<p>The University of Miami has agreed to pay more than $1 million each to the families of a university football player and a friend who were murdered in his campus apartment in April, the Miami Herald reported Saturday.</p>
<p>The university did not disclose the amount of the settlement, which the newspaper attributed to unnamed sources. It said only that a settlement was reached with the families of Marlin Barnes and Timwanika Lumpkins and that the money would be paid by its liability insurance.</p>
<p>Barnes and Lumpkins were found bludgeoned to death in what was believed to be the university's first on-campus murders.</p>
<p>Lumpkins' former boyfriend, Labrant &quot;Anthony&quot; Dennis, has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the killings.</p>
<p>The settlement avoids public proceedings over whether the university bore any responsibility for the deaths, such as inadequate security, the newspaper said.</p>
