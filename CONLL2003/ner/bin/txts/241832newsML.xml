<p>What started as a role-playing game for a group of teenagers turned into a cult of self-proclaimed &quot;vampires,&quot; who cut their bodies, drank blood and now face charges of murdering one members' parents.</p>
<p>The five teens, aged 15 to 19, have been extradited to Florida from Louisiana for the slaying of a Eustis couple bludgeoned to death in their home last month.</p>
<p>The mother of the accused ringleader of the group told on Saturday of how she played a &quot;vampire&quot; game with her son and how she thought it was just fun and make-believe.</p>
<p>But police say Sondra Gibson's son Roderick Ferrell, 16, became lost in a delusional world of &quot;vampire&quot; rituals and conspiracies that led to the horrific double murder of Richard and Ruth Wendorf on Nov. 25.</p>
<p>Police believe the murder weapon was either an axe or claw hammer and that the deadly blows were inflicted by at least three different people.</p>
<p>The Wendorf's daughter Heather, 15, was among the group. She, Ferrell, and three others -- 19-year-old Dana Lynn Cooper, Howard Scott Anderson, 16, and Charity Keesee, 16 -- were arrested on Nov. 28 in the murdered couple's car while checking into a Baton Rouge motel.</p>
<p>All the teens except Wendorf are residents of rural Murray, Kentucky, a small, predominantly Baptist town where Ferrell's interest in a role-playing board game, &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade,&quot; turned into an obsession, according to police.</p>
<p>Ferrell had recruited Wendorf, his girlfriend, into the game, his mother said.</p>
<p>&quot;There didn't seem to be anything wrong with it,&quot; Gibson told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>&quot;I played it with him. It's hard enough to find something you can do with your kids today, and the game was fun. It was something, anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>Ferrell moved to Murray from Florida in 1995 to live with his mother and her boyfriend, Kile Newton, a tattoo artist who changed his name to &quot;Kile,&quot; a word self-styled vampires are said to use to describe someone who &quot;crossed over&quot; to become &quot;one of the undead.&quot;</p>
<p>The game is similar to the better-known Dungeon &amp; Dragons in which players adapt character names and are led through a series of adventures by a game leader, or storyteller.</p>
<p>Ferrell and Gibson met other Vampire players, most of them teens, after moving to Murray. Over time, a group of about 30 youths began trying to live out vampire identities.</p>
<p>Gibson said the game had remained a fantasy. &quot;It was a thrill, sure. But it was still role playing. People pretended to do stuff, but didn't really do it,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Gibson faces misdemeanor charges of trying to seduce a 14-year-old boy as part of a vampire ritual.</p>
<p>Calloway County, Kentucky, prosecutors have released a letter in which she writes, &quot;I long to be near you ... to become a Vampire, a part of the family immortal and truly yours forever.&quot;</p>
<p>Gibson scoffed. &quot;All part of the game,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Ferrell began wearing black shirts, black trousers, a long black jacket and black cowboy boots. He died his blond hair black and painted his fingernails black. He began to call himself Vesago, after a character in a novel by Ann Rice, an author known for her books about vampires.</p>
<p>In September, Ferrell was suspended from school, after which, Gibson said, he did not go back, sleeping all day and going out at night with his vampire friends.</p>
<p>Calloway County authorites said Ferrell and the other would-be vampires gathered at a ruined building painted with messages like, &quot;Please deposit dead bodies here,&quot; but also littered with empty liquor bottles and signs of drug use.</p>
<p>&quot;It's pretty easy to tell who's been a vampire for any length of time,&quot; said Calloway County Sheriff Stan Scott. &quot;Most of them are going to have self-inflicted razor cuts or knife cuts. They like to drink each other's blood.&quot;</p>
<p>In October, Ferrell and Anderson were charged with breaking into the county humane society, beating 40 dogs and mutilating two puppies. One dog's hind legs were torn off.</p>
<p>Greg Fountain, an executive with White Wolf, of Clarkson, Georgia, which markets &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot;, said the game could get intense, but that it was not a cult.</p>
<p>&quot;It can be quite intense,&quot; he said. &quot;The core premise is personal exploration.&quot;</p>
