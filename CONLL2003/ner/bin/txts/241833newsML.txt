NEW YORK 1996-12-07

A 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death and his girlfriend was seriously injured in an attack at a New York subway station, police said on Saturday.

The victims were attacked at about 8 p.m. EST on Friday as they were about to board a Manhattan-bound train from their home in the borough of Queens, police said.

Hang Chen, 17, was pronounced dead at the scene, and his 16-year-old girlfriend was in serious condition at a local hospital. Police did not released her name.

Two suspects were caught as they attempted to flee the station, and one of them had a knife which they believe was used in the attack, police said.

Police have charged Jian Ting Gao, 18, and Sheng Liang Lin, 16, with second-degree murder and attempted murder.

According to police, Chen had a previous argument with the suspects earlier in the day. "We believe the argument involved a lover's triangle," a police spokeswoman said.

Police said that the two suspects confronted Chen on the subway platform and stabbed him repeatedly. "During the confrontation, Chen's girlfriend went to his aide and was stabbed," the spokeswoman said.
