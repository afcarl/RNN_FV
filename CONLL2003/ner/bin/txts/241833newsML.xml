<p>A 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death and his girlfriend was seriously injured in an attack at a New York subway station, police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The victims were attacked at about 8 p.m. EST on Friday as they were about to board a Manhattan-bound train from their home in the borough of Queens, police said.</p>
<p>Hang Chen, 17, was pronounced dead at the scene, and his 16-year-old girlfriend was in serious condition at a local hospital. Police did not released her name.</p>
<p>Two suspects were caught as they attempted to flee the station, and one of them had a knife which they believe was used in the attack, police said.</p>
<p>Police have charged Jian Ting Gao, 18, and Sheng Liang Lin, 16, with second-degree murder and attempted murder.</p>
<p>According to police, Chen had a previous argument with the suspects earlier in the day. &quot;We believe the argument involved a lover's triangle,&quot; a police spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Police said that the two suspects confronted Chen on the subway platform and stabbed him repeatedly. &quot;During the confrontation, Chen's girlfriend went to his aide and was stabbed,&quot; the spokeswoman said.</p>
