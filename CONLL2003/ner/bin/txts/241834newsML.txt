Industrial accident closes Philadelphia bridge.

PHILADELPHIA 1996-12-07

The Walt Whitman Bridge was closed for two hours on Saturday morning while a hazardous materials team from the city fire department dealt with a chemical leak at a nearby factory.

Four tolltakers at the bridge, one of four spanning the Delaware River in the city, were taken to a hospital for observation after complaining of headaches and difficulty breathing. No other injuries were reported.

The incident began at 7 a.m. EST when fumes were released by a chemical reaction in a mixing vat at Ashland Chemical Co., a subsidiary of the Ashland oil company.

Firefighters brought the reaction under control by cooling the vat, according to fire chief George DelRossi, who described the fumes as non-toxic.
