<title>USA: U.S. shuttle lands in Florida.</title>
<headline>U.S. shuttle lands in Florida.</headline>
<dateline>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida 1996-12-07</dateline>

<p>The U.S. space shuttle Columbia glided to a dawn touchdown in Florida on Saturday, ending a record-breaking 18-day mission marred by the cancellation of two space walks.</p>
<p>The $2 billion spaceship landed on the three-mile (4.8 km) long runway at Kennedy Space Centre at 6:49 a.m. EST (1149 GMT), just a short distance from the launch pad it blasted off from on Nov. 19.  </p>
<p>It was NASA's third attempt to land the shuttle. Dense fog in Florida and high winds at the backup landing strip in California had cancelled the shuttle's landing on Friday. The day before cloudy skies at the Florida spaceport were the problem.</p>
<p>The shuttle's extended stay in space propelled the mission into the record books as the longest ever in the 15-year shuttle program. Columbia, the oldest of NASA's four shuttles, had set the previous record of 17 days last July.</p>
<p>The marathon mission was marred by a jammed airlock hatch that forced NASA to cancel a pair of space walks. Astronauts Tammy Jernigan and Tom Jones had spent months training for the space walks, which had been intended to test construction tools for a planned permanent space station.</p>
<p>During the mission, the astronauts released and later retrieved two science satellites. A U.S.-German telescope studied the life cycles of stars and a prototype computer chip factory manufactured ultra-pure semiconductors for the electronics industry.</p>
