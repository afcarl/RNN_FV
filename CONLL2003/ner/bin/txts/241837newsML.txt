Rating agency dealt blow in Orange County suit.

SANTA ANA, Calif. 1996-12-06

A federal judge dealt a blow to credit rating agency Standard & Poor's Corp. in its heated legal battle with Orange County, Calif., challenging S&P's claim to First Amendment protection.

In an opinion released in Santa Ana on Friday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Ryan concluded that S&P's "broad-based argument for dismissal of the complaint based on alleged First Amendment protections is without merit."

An S&P spokesman said the firm "will be renewing our motion to dismiss the important First Amendment and related issues before the federal District Court in the near future."

Orange County sued McGraw-Hill Cos Inc.'s S&P in June in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for $500 million for its alleged involvement in the county's investment crisis. The suit has since been moved from bankruptcy to district court.

The county sued the rating agency for breach of contract, professional negligence and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty. According to the suit, S&P's ratings assured the county and the public that former county Treasurer Robert Citron was "conservatively and safely" managing county funds.

Had S&P met its "contractual obligations" and "exercised professional due care," the county claimed it would have taken steps to reduce its exposure to risk "in time to avoid more than $500 million in losses that the county later suffered."

Orange County filed for protection under Chapter 9 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code on Dec. 6, 1994, after sustaining investment losses of more than $1.6 billion. It was the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. The county emerged from bankruptcy in June.

In its legal battle with the county, S&P argued that it was entitled to certain First Amendment protections as a financial publisher. The rating agency said the county must plead that S&P acted with "actual malice" -- that S&P either knowingly published false information or published this information with reckless disregard for the truth.

The county, in response, argued that the First Amendment does not protect publishers from liability for breach of contract. Under the terms of S&P's contract with the county, the rating agency was required to issue bond ratings and investment services that were "competent, honest and not deceptive," the county said.

"Clearly, the publication of security ratings provides a public service to the investment community and is a matter of public interest," Ryan wrote in his 37-page opinion. "However, First Amendment protection is not without limits."

Judge Ryan said he agreed with the county that "S&P's publisher status does not provide First Amendment protection as to all S&P's activities. Under the circumstances here, the county does not have to plead actual malice in order to maintain its claims."

He concluded that S&P was not entitled to dismissal of the county's lawsuit based on the First Amendment. He also found that the county had "successfully" argued both breach of contract and professional negligence against S&P and denied the rating agency's motion to dismiss the two claims.

In S&P's favor, Ryan said the county's claim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty must be dismissed because the rating agency does not have an independent fiduciary duty to the county.

County attorneys said Ryan's opinion was a major victory for Orange County, and could make it easier for other municipilities that sue the rating agencies.
