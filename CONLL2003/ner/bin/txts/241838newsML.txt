Freeh shown bombing confessions of six Saudis - ABC.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

Saudi officials have shown FBI Director Louis Freeh the videotaped confessions of six Saudis accused of involvement in last June's bombing of the U.S. military complex in Dhahran, ABC-TV reported on Friday.

The network said that in the edited videotape, the six accused Saudi men provided information about links between Iran and a network of extremists who carried out the June 25 truck bombing, which killed 19 U.S. servicemen.

ABC quoted U.S. officials as saying many details could not be independently verified, but the confessions supported growing U.S. suspicion that Iran was a major player in organising, funding and executing the attack on the Khobar Tower housing complex.

An FBI spokesman declined to comment on the report.

Freeh travelled to Saudi Arabia last month for meetings with Saudi leaders and discussions about the investigation into the bombing, at the invitation of the Saudi government.

FBI officials previously had complained about a lack of cooperation from Saudi authorities in the investigation. They said FBI agents were not allowed to question Saudi citizens and were not told about any arrests, ABC said.

In their confessions, the six men said they were recruited by an Iranian intelligence agent while at a Shiite religious celebration in Damascus, Syria. They said they received "religious training" over the next year and a half in Iran's holy city of Gom, and spent time at two Hezbollah guerrilla training camps in Syria and Lebanon, according to the ABC report.

A handful of U.S. agents remain in Saudi Arabia working on the investigation, down from more than 70 agents who initially had been sent to help examine evidence and investigate suspects.
