<headline>Freeh shown bombing confessions of six Saudis - ABC.</headline>

<p>Saudi officials have shown FBI Director Louis Freeh the videotaped confessions of six Saudis accused of involvement in last June's bombing of the U.S. military complex in Dhahran, ABC-TV reported on Friday.</p>
<p>The network said that in the edited videotape, the six accused Saudi men provided information about links between Iran and a network of extremists who carried out the June 25 truck bombing, which killed 19 U.S. servicemen.</p>
<p>ABC quoted U.S. officials as saying many details could not be independently verified, but the confessions supported growing U.S. suspicion that Iran was a major player in organising, funding and executing the attack on the Khobar Tower housing complex.</p>
<p>An FBI spokesman declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p>Freeh travelled to Saudi Arabia last month for meetings with Saudi leaders and discussions about the investigation into the bombing, at the invitation of the Saudi government.</p>
<p>FBI officials previously had complained about a lack of cooperation from Saudi authorities in the investigation. They said FBI agents were not allowed to question Saudi citizens and were not told about any arrests, ABC said.</p>
<p>In their confessions, the six men said they were recruited by an Iranian intelligence agent while at a Shiite religious celebration in Damascus, Syria. They said they received &quot;religious training&quot; over the next year and a half in Iran's holy city of Gom, and spent time at two Hezbollah guerrilla training camps in Syria and Lebanon, according to the ABC report.</p>
<p>A handful of U.S. agents remain in Saudi Arabia working on the investigation, down from more than 70 agents who initially had been sent to help examine evidence and investigate suspects.</p>
