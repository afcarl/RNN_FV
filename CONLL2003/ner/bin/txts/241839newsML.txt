LOS ANGELES 1996-12-06

U.S. West Coast light crudes rebounded to the previous session's levels late Friday, as concerns about supply shortness in the WTI market and technical bullishness offset the morning's weak tone.

Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude edged back up with WTI amid flat diffs. Outright prices for ANS ended $23.75/23.95 a barrel, even with Thursday.

Offers for Alaskan crude stayed $1.65 under WTI while buyers kept bids at $2.00 under.

Friday spot trade for ANS thinned as traders left the market early ahead of the weekend.  

Dealers said a tender of Argentine Rincon crude closed Thursday, with Unocal rumored to have won the shipments.

Diffs for Line 63 remained unchanged at $3.20/3.00 under WTI.

Discounts for Kern River heavy crude remained 10 cents under postings to even with postings, traders said. Outright prices increased 30 cents to $17.90/18.00 a barrel after more oil companies reported posted price increases Friday.

Wilmington premiums stagnated at 55 to 65 cents over postings, but outright prices rose 40 cents on the increased postings.
