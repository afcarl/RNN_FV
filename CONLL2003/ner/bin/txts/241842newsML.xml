<p>Richard Holbrooke, who negotiated the Bosnia peace deal and was a runner-up contender for U.S. secretary of state, is a leading candidate to become the next American ambassador to the United Nations, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>Some sources said they believed Holbrooke could have the envoy's job if he wanted it but that he was undecided. Others insisted the selection process was &quot;not that far along&quot; and that at least one other candidate, U.S. Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat, was also under consideration.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry told Reuters that &quot;no one's been offered the job and no decision has been made.&quot;</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton &quot;has enormous high regard and affection for Dick Holbrooke and because of that the White House declines to put him through any unneccessry speculation at this point,&quot; McCurry said.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview with Reuters on Thursday, Holbrooke refused to comment on speculation he might be named to the U.N. post, which is being vacated by Madeleine Albright, whom Clinton appointed the next secretary of state.</p>
<p>Not long ago, it was accepted wisdom among some U.S. officials that Holbrooke would take up the U.N. post in New York if Albright were named secretary of state. But insiders say National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, whom Clinton appointed his next Director of Central Intelligence, has worked against Holbrooke, a controversial figure.</p>
<p>Holbrooke, a former assistant secretary of state who was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize this year because of his work on Bosnia, said Clinton called him in advance on Thursday to inform him Albright would be named secretary of state.</p>
<p>In the week before the announcement, some felt Holbrooke had the edge for the job.</p>
<p>&quot;I told him I was touched by the call and that I was honoured to have been part of the Clinton administration and as always will do whatever the president asks me to do at any time,&quot; said Holbrooke, who twice undertook special missions to Bosnia after leaving government service earlier this year.</p>
<p>Holbrooke praised the selection of Albright -- the first woman named to the post in more than 200 years of U.S. history -- as a &quot;terrific statement to the women of the world.&quot;</p>
