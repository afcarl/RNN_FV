Senate probe of Democrats' election finances set.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-06

Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott set in motion Friday a planned Senate investigation of questionable fund-raising by President Clinton's election campaign.

Lott said the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee would proceed with the investigation "immediately upon the swearing in of the 105th Congress on January 7, 1977."

The inquiry will be headed, as expected, by the committee's incoming chairman, Sen Fred Thompson, R-Tennessee, who was the Republican counsel on the Senate Watergate Committee that investigated wrongdoing in the Richard Nixon administration.

Other investigations into the affair that has embarrassed the White House are getting under way in the House of Representatives.

Meanwhile Friday a U.S. District Couurt judge in Washington ordered the impoundment of four Commerce Department computers in a court case brought by lawyers seeking to find if department trade missions were used improperly to solicit political contributions.

Included was the computer of former Commerce Department official John Huang, whose later fund-raising for the Democratic National Committee became a major issue towards the end of the presidential election campaign. About $1.5 million in campaign funds raised by Huang has been returned.

Judge Royce Lamberth issued the order at the request of Judicial Watch after hearing testimony that former Commerce Department employee Melinda Yee had thrown away her notes on a trade mission before she left the department.

The other computers to be taken into custody by the department's inspector general were those of Lee, former official Ira Sockowitz and current employee Dalia Traynham.

The judge ordered that officials responding to Judicial Watch's Freedom of Information requests have supervised access to the computers "in order to conduct a search for appropriate documents."
