<p>Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott set in motion Friday a planned Senate investigation of questionable fund-raising by President Clinton's election campaign.</p>
<p>Lott said the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee would proceed with the investigation &quot;immediately upon the swearing in of the 105th Congress on January 7, 1977.&quot;</p>
<p>The inquiry will be headed, as expected, by the committee's incoming chairman, Sen Fred Thompson, R-Tennessee, who was the Republican counsel on the Senate Watergate Committee that investigated wrongdoing in the Richard Nixon administration.</p>
<p>Other investigations into the affair that has embarrassed the White House are getting under way in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Friday a U.S. District Couurt judge in Washington ordered the impoundment of four Commerce Department computers in a court case brought by lawyers seeking to find if department trade missions were used improperly to solicit political contributions.</p>
<p>Included was the computer of former Commerce Department official John Huang, whose later fund-raising for the Democratic National Committee became a major issue towards the end of the presidential election campaign. About $1.5 million in campaign funds raised by Huang has been returned.</p>
<p>Judge Royce Lamberth issued the order at the request of Judicial Watch after hearing testimony that former Commerce Department employee Melinda Yee had thrown away her notes on a trade mission before she left the department.</p>
<p>The other computers to be taken into custody by the department's inspector general were those of Lee, former official Ira Sockowitz and current employee Dalia Traynham.</p>
<p>The judge ordered that officials responding to Judicial Watch's Freedom of Information requests have supervised access to the computers &quot;in order to conduct a search for appropriate documents.&quot;</p>
