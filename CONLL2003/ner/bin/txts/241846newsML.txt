AIKEN, S.C. 1996-12-06

A South Carolina woman, two of her children, a grandchild and another child were killed Friday when the car she was driving collided head-on with a school bus near Wagner, about 25 miles east of here.

Police identified the driver as Linda Tindal, 41, of Wagner and said she was intoxicated and driving at a high rate of speed.

"It will be ruled an alcohol-related accident," said South Carolina Highway Patrol Corporal Jones Gamble, citing a preliminary toxicology report from the coroner. He declined to disclose her blood-alcohol level.

Also killed were her children, Nicki, 10 and Christine, 8; her 4-year-old granddaughter, Brittney; and a fourth child whose name was withheld until a relative has been notified.

No children were on the school bus and the driver was not injured.
