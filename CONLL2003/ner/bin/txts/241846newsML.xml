<p>A South Carolina woman, two of her children, a grandchild and another child were killed Friday when the car she was driving collided head-on with a school bus near Wagner, about 25 miles east of here.</p>
<p>Police identified the driver as Linda Tindal, 41, of Wagner and said she was intoxicated and driving at a high rate of speed.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be ruled an alcohol-related accident,&quot; said South Carolina Highway Patrol Corporal Jones Gamble, citing a preliminary toxicology report from the coroner. He declined to disclose her blood-alcohol level.</p>
<p>Also killed were her children, Nicki, 10 and Christine, 8; her 4-year-old granddaughter, Brittney; and a fourth child whose name was withheld until a relative has been notified.</p>
<p>No children were on the school bus and the driver was not injured.</p>
