<p>A gasoline truck exploded and burst into flames Friday as it was delivering fuel to a Toyota Motor Co facility in Fremont, California, fire officials said.</p>
<p>The tanker truck containing about 9,000 gallons of fuel exploded at the Toyota logistics services facility next to the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc (NUMMI) manufacturing plant, Fremont fire department spokesman Dennis Satariano said. Firefighters were spraying water on three gasoline storage tanks to keep them cool, he said, adding there were no injuries.  </p>
<p>The tanker truck was offloading gasoline at the Toyota plant when the hose broke and gasoline fumes ignited, Satariano said. There was an explosion and fierce fire, he said.</p>
<p>He said firefighters were trying to keep the blaze from spreading to three nearby storage tanks, each containing about 2,000 gallons of gasoline. &quot;The object is to keep water on them to keep them cool,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nine fire engines were battling the blaze, he said. Several other vehicles had been damaged but there are no buildings or houses in the immediate vicinity, he said.</p>
<p>The Toyota facility adjoins the NUMMI plant, a joint venture between General Motors Corp and Toyota which produces cars and pickup trucks. It prepares for delivery Toyota vehicles produced at the NUMMI plant.</p>
