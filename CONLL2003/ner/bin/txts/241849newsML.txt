CAW says concludes talks with Canadian.

TORONTO 1996-12-06

The union representing 3,700 ticket agents at Canadian Airlines Corp said said on Friday that it has concluded talks with the airline over its restructuring plan.

"The bargaining committee has concluded its discussions with the company on a number of collective bargaining issues," the Canadian Auto Workers said in a statement.

The union is the only one of six unions at Canada's second largest airline which has not accepted a restructuring plan to save the company.

The airline is seeking wage cuts of C$35 million ($26 million) a year from Canadian's 16,400 employees, which it has called crucial to its survival.

The union said it plans to hold a news conference on Saturday morning to announce its decision regarding the federal government's ordered vote on forced wage cuts.

Canadian Labor Minister Alfonso Gagliano on Wednesday invoked a little-used section in the Canadian Labor Code to force the vote, which has been adamantly opposed by CAW leader Buzz Hargrove.
