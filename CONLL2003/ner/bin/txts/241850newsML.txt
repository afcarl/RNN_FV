TORONTO 1996-12-06

Bre-X Minerals Ltd formally denied on Friday a published report that there was a deal with Barrick Gold Corp for rights to Indonesia's Busang gold deposit.

"There's a number of things that have been tabled," Bre-X spokesman Steve McAnulty said in a telephone interview.

"The best thing to say about it is there are still unresolved issues. It would premature for me to comment," McAnulty said.

He said Bre-X and Barrick were still negotiating.
