Arakis deal shows Sudan is isolated - rights group.

The absence of a U.S. participant in a huge Sudanese oil deal announced by Canada's Arakis Energy Corp on Friday shows Sudan has failed to expand relations beyond current allies, an official with a group that opposed U.S. involvement said.  

"The reading on this is that the Sudan government has not broadened its contacts at all. It's had to go back to its friends to do this," said Bill Lowrey of the Sudan Working Group, an organization of humanitarian and multi-denominational religious groups.

"In that sense, Arakis has failed and Sudan has failed to get the support they were looking for -- other than they got the money," he said in a telephone interview from his Washington office.  

Arakis on Friday ended a year of speculation by announcing a consortium to proceed with exploration and development of its oil concession in Sudan, and construction of a 950-mile pipeline to the Red Sea from the Heglig and Unity fields in the country's south.

Partners in the billion-dollar deal include Arakis with 25 percent, China National Petroleum Corp with 40 percent, Malaysia state-owned oil company Petronas Caligali with 30 percent and the Sudan government with five percent.  

Arakis chief executive John McLeod said political tension between Sudan and the United States was the main reason behind the absence of the potential U.S. partner -- widely seen as Occidental Petroleum Corp -- from the final roster.

Analysts said that a U.S. participant would have given the project extra credibility in the eyes of investors.

An executive order signed recently by President Clinton to halt the granting of visas to Sudanese officials wanting to enter the United States came at a crucial time in the intense negotiations, McLeod said.  

U.S. government sources said Friday that they believed the visa move, and news in early November that the United States was sending US$20 million in military aid to neighboring states in what was alleged to be indirect support of Sudanese rebels, convinced the Khartoum government to force Occidental out of the discussions.

The United States has denied the aid was for assisting groups aiming to topple Sudan's Islamic government.

Occidental declined comment on Friday.  

Arakis has often received threats from the Sudan People Liberation Army, a rebel group fighting for greater independence for Sudan's mainly Christian and animist south from the Moslem-dominated north.

Lowrey said Western humantarian groups remain concerned that Khartoum could use revenues to step up the 13-year war against the rebels.

"It will certainly be a serious development if they are able to move forward and if this oil is developed in a way that it is not a resource shared by the people, but is split between foreign investors and the Sudan government, which can use it to fuel the war," he said.

Analysts on Friday said a consortium without U.S. participation may have averted future negative political ramifications amid increasingly tense relations between Sudan and the United States. Earlier this year, Washington placed Sudan on a list of sanctioned nations accused of supporting terrorism. ((Reuters Calgary Bureau (403) 531-1624))
