<p>The absence of a U.S. participant in a huge Sudanese oil deal announced by Canada's Arakis Energy Corp on Friday shows Sudan has failed to expand relations beyond current allies, an official with a group that opposed U.S. involvement said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The reading on this is that the Sudan government has not broadened its contacts at all. It's had to go back to its friends to do this,&quot; said Bill Lowrey of the Sudan Working Group, an organization of humanitarian and multi-denominational religious groups.</p>
<p>&quot;In that sense, Arakis has failed and Sudan has failed to get the support they were looking for -- other than they got the money,&quot; he said in a telephone interview from his Washington office.  </p>
<p>Arakis on Friday ended a year of speculation by announcing a consortium to proceed with exploration and development of its oil concession in Sudan, and construction of a 950-mile pipeline to the Red Sea from the Heglig and Unity fields in the country's south.</p>
<p>Partners in the billion-dollar deal include Arakis with 25 percent, China National Petroleum Corp with 40 percent, Malaysia state-owned oil company Petronas Caligali with 30 percent and the Sudan government with five percent.  </p>
<p>Arakis chief executive John McLeod said political tension between Sudan and the United States was the main reason behind the absence of the potential U.S. partner -- widely seen as Occidental Petroleum Corp -- from the final roster.</p>
<p>Analysts said that a U.S. participant would have given the project extra credibility in the eyes of investors.</p>
<p>An executive order signed recently by President Clinton to halt the granting of visas to Sudanese officials wanting to enter the United States came at a crucial time in the intense negotiations, McLeod said.  </p>
<p>U.S. government sources said Friday that they believed the visa move, and news in early November that the United States was sending US$20 million in military aid to neighboring states in what was alleged to be indirect support of Sudanese rebels, convinced the Khartoum government to force Occidental out of the discussions.</p>
<p>The United States has denied the aid was for assisting groups aiming to topple Sudan's Islamic government.</p>
<p>Occidental declined comment on Friday.  </p>
<p>Arakis has often received threats from the Sudan People Liberation Army, a rebel group fighting for greater independence for Sudan's mainly Christian and animist south from the Moslem-dominated north.</p>
<p>Lowrey said Western humantarian groups remain concerned that Khartoum could use revenues to step up the 13-year war against the rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;It will certainly be a serious development if they are able to move forward and if this oil is developed in a way that it is not a resource shared by the people, but is split between foreign investors and the Sudan government, which can use it to fuel the war,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts on Friday said a consortium without U.S. participation may have averted future negative political ramifications amid increasingly tense relations between Sudan and the United States. Earlier this year, Washington placed Sudan on a list of sanctioned nations accused of supporting terrorism. ((Reuters Calgary Bureau (403) 531-1624))</p>
