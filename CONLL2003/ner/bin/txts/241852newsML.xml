<p>Greek farmers decided on Saturday to widen their protests, ignoring appeals by socialist officials to end the paralysing 10-day-long road and rail blockade.</p>
<p>Farmers' unions from around the country which met in the central Greek town of Larissa, vowed to boost and extend their protest, calling on more farmers to join them.</p>
<p>&quot;We appeal to all those who have not yet participated to come join us now,&quot; said a statement issued after the meeting. &quot;This is a common struggle for all farmers.&quot;</p>
<p>Farmers have brought Greek transport to a near standstill demanding price supports, cheaper fuel, the rescheduling of $1.3 billion in debts and lower Value Added Tax on farming equipment.</p>
<p>Police said they counted more than 90 blockades of roads and rail lines by thousands of tractors. They sent officers to guard the Corinth canal after threats by the farmers that they would barricade its bridge.</p>
<p>Greek socialist Prime Minister Costas Simitis, facing his first big test since winning elections in September, has ordered his deputies to go and talk to the protesters in an effort to stop the blockades.</p>
<p>He has appealed to the farmers to abandon their protest but refused to satisfy their demands, saying Greece could not afford to deviate from European Union convergence targets.</p>
<p>&quot;The price of satisfying the farmers' demands is four billion dollars, equal to the amount which we are desperately trying to secure from new taxes and spending cuts in the budget,&quot; Simitis told parliament on Friday.</p>
<p>Simitis fears that bowing to the farmers would encourage other groups to make demands on a 1997 austerity budget intended to set the economy on an EU convergence course.</p>
<p>Several unions have staged walkouts against the budget, and boisterous protest marches are an almost daily event in Athens. Civil servants have called a nationwide strike for December 17.</p>
<p>Even Greek diplomats went on strike around the world on Friday to protest against taxing their spending money while they serve abroad.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos told Greek reporters in Brussels he had tried but failed to convince the prime minister to leave Greek diplomats, who are among the worst paid in the EU, out of the taxman's net.</p>
<p>&quot;We called on the Greek people to make sacrifices and some block the roads and threaten to destroy this effort. We tell them that we will not endanger the country's future,&quot; Simitis told parliament.</p>
<p>The farmers, unimpressed by his call to stop, boosted their numbers with more tractors arriving at barricades and makeshift campsites springing up close to the highways.</p>
<p>Scuffles have broken out between farmers and international lorry drivers stuck in the blockade.</p>
<p>&quot;We are out of food and cigarettes, we are filthy,&quot; a Greek truck driver blocked near Larissa told television reporters. &quot;There are drivers here from England, Bulgaria, Turkey and we are all at a dead end.&quot;</p>
<p>The first signs of shortages appeared at the food markets of Athens and the northern city of Salonika, while pharmacists warned that they could soon face serious supply problems.</p>
<p>&quot;There isn't a single kilo of meat from Athens today,&quot; the head of the Salonika meat merchants' union, Nikos Adamis, told reporters.</p>
