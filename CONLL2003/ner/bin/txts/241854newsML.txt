France asked it European neighbours for help in tracking down the bombers of a Paris underground train, but there is no evidence any of them live in Germany, a spokesman for the German Interior Ministry said on Saturday.

French authorities distributed a list of 13 suspects across Europe as part of routine procedures, the spokesman said. They have not ruled out the possibility that some of the suspects could have fled abroad.

But he said there was no concrete evidence that any of the 13 suspects, thought to be Algerian, lived in Germany.

A spokeswoman for the Federal Office for Criminal Investigation in Wiesbaden told Reuters French police had asked Germany to be on alert for the suspects who could have fled abroad, but she said there was no active search under way.

She confirmed a report in Saturday's Bild newspaper which said French authorities had asked neighbouring police forces to be on alert.

Three people were killed and 94 treated for injuries after a bomb exploded on a train at the Port Royal station in Paris on Tuesday.

The bomb, concealed in a bulky 13-kg (27-lb) gas canister, was placed under a seat in a bag. Twenty people were still in hospital on Friday.
