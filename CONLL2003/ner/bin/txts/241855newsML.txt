France seeks help in Europe in hunt for bombers.

PARIS 1996-12-07

France has sought help from other European countries in the hunt for bombers who attacked a Paris commuter train on Tuesday, killing three people and injuring 94, the Interior Ministry said on Saturday.

But it refused to confirm or deny a French television report saying France had sent its neighbours a list of 13 people suspected of involvement in the attack.

"We indeed addressed a request for cooperation from German police as well as to police in other European countries," a ministry spokesman told Reuters.

"This move is part of the routine investigations and verifications that we have initiated in the framework of this investigation," he said.

In Bonn, German police confirmed French authorities had asked them to help track down the bombers but added that they were not actively searching for suspects.

A spokeswoman for the Federal Office for Criminal Investigation in Wiesbaden confirmed a report in Saturday's Bild newspaper which said French authorities had asked German police to be on alert as some of the suspects, thought to be Algerian, may have fled to Germany and others to Italy.

French authorities have said in the past that they were uneasy about the activities of Algerian Moslem fundamentalists in Belgium, Britain, Sweden and Germany.

No one has claimed responsibility for Tuesday's blast.

The Algerian Armed Islamic Group (GIA) claimed responsibility for a series of bomb attacks in France in 1995 in which eight people were killed and 160 injured.

French newspapers said investigators believed the bomb used in the Port Royal attack may have weighed up to 20 kg (44 lbs). It was packed in a bulky gas canister placed under a seat in a wheeled bag similar to those used by grocery shoppers.

Police were investigating the theft last last month from a petrol station in an area with a large Algerian immigrant population of around 40 gas canisters of the type used in the attack, newspaper said.

They were also dubious about the authenticity of several telephone calls to Radio Luxembourg claiming responsibility for the bombing in the name of the GIA and saying other attacks would follow unless Moslem militants arrested last year were freed, the papers said.

Police said on Friday that an Algerian man carrying a false passport was detained at the northern French port of Calais on Thursday while trying to board a Channel ferry for Britain.

But investigators concluded after questioning that he had no link to the train bombing, sources close to the probe said.

The man was to be questioned further in Paris, they added.

The French Human Rights League has called on authorities not to make France's three million Arabs scapegoats for the attack.

It asked that police refrain from systematically treating Arabs as suspects and singling them out in crowds for identity checks and body-searches.
