Prosecutor defends big raids against Di Pietro.

A prosecutor on Saturday defended massive police raids on homes and offices of Antonio Di Pietro, the former magistrate whose attack on corruption made him a national folk hero.

"The aim...is to arrive rapidly and completely at acertaining the truth," Brescia chief prosecutor Giancarlo Tarquini told reporters. "If we used this method it means we think it was necessary."

It was Tarquini's office that ordered the raids on Friday in which about 230 revenue police searched for evidence of alleged irregularities by Di Pietro when he ran inquiries that destroyed Italy's political establishment in the early 1990s.

Offices of Di Pietro's business associates and lawyers were also targeted in the raids, comparable in scope and media coverage to those against the Mafia.

The move against the 46-year-old Di Pietro, who resigned as magistrate two years ago and as public works minister last month, left many Italian shocked and puzzled.

In an editorial headlined "The Fallen Idol," Rome's La Repubblica said the raids were a hammer blow to the image of the entire "Clean Hands" anti-corruption team of magistrates in Milan who uncovered widespread political corruption.

"The magistrate who uncovered the rot of Italy and laid bare the corruption of an entire political class is now not only being investigated but has become a direct target of the spectacular rite of colossal-style justice that he personified for years," the newspaper said.

"We are witnessing such a reversal of roles that it is easy to understand why public opinion is so disconcerted," it said.

Turin's La Stampa hoped that "truth and not vendetta" would be the end result of what appears to be a war of wills between various factions among Italy's magistrates. Di Pietro still has the firm backing of his former colleagues in Milan.

Friday's raids were ordered by magistrates in the northern city of Brescia, who began a fresh investigation of Di Pietro last month over suspicions that he may have been involved in extortion and abuse of office, according to media reports.

In his November 14 letter of resignation from Prime Minister Romano Prodi's government, Di Pietro said the probe was "pigeon shoot". He implied it was part of what he has portrayed as a vendetta by defendants he exposed in his corruption probes.

He has not commented yet on the raids but already received popular support. A bed sheet with the words "Di Pietro-Don't Give Up" was hung from a Brescia highway overpass on Saturday.

Di Pietro was the target of an earlier probe by Brescia magistrates into allegations of corruption. All charges against him were dropped in that inquiry in April shortly before he was named to the cabinet.

Last week he wrote to Brescia magistrates about rumours of of possible arrest and was transferring his legal residence so his family would not be disturbed if a warrant was served.

Di Pietro's lawyer, Massimo Dinoia, said agents had seized a number of legal documents -- including some he wanted to use in his defence against the latest accusations -- from Di Pietro's home near Milan. Di Pietro was not present but his wife and two small children had been awakened by police, the lawyer said.

Some of Di Pietro's past targets appeared to be gloating on Saturday, saying he had become a victim of his own methods.

"He didn't worry about my children when he sent police to search my house and arrest me," Giusepe Adamoli, a former Christian Democrat politician who was the target of a Di Pietro investigation in 1992, told La Stampa newspaper.

Di Pietro resigned in December 1994, soon after Milan magistrates placed then-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi under investigation amid rumours that he was forced out. He has never fully explained his decision.
