Algeria's new constitution signed into law.

PARIS 1996-12-07

Algerian President Liamine Zeroual on Saturday signed into law constitutional reforms which ban political parties based on religion or language and aim to help end five years of bloodshed.

The official Algerian news agency APS, quoting a statement from the presidency, said Zeroual signed the decree to promulgate the reforms approved in a referendum last month.

The main changes extend the president's powers, allow political parties but ban those based on religion and language, limit the president to two five-year terms, and confirm Islam as the state religion.

Zeroual acted one day after Algerian security forces said "a group of terrorists" -- Algerian official language for Moslem fundamentalists -- had killed 19 people in a night raid on an isolated community in Blida province, south of the capital.

The attack was the second in two nights, and brought to 29 the number of civilians killed in the latest upsurge of violence. The security forces' terminology indicated the civilians had died by having their throats cut.

About 60,000 people have been killed in Algeria's conflict which erupted after the January 1992 cancellation of a general election in which Islamic fundamentalists had taken a commanding lead.

Zeroual, appointed head of state in January 1994 and elected as president in November 1995 in Algeria's first multi- candidate presidential poll, has promised a general election will be held early next year.

Early this week, Zeroual told judges at the opening of the judicial year:

"In approving the constitutional revision project...the Algerian people have reaffirmed with force their own convictions towards all those who doubt their capacity and determination to overcome the crisis...."

Official results for the referendum showed turnout at 79.78 percent of the 16.4 million registered voters. Some 10.7 million, or 84.60 percent, approved the changed constitution.

Algerian authorities said the referendum, under tight security, was free of violence. Independent newspapers said at least 26 people died in bombings and other attacks.

Since early November, despite tight censorship in Algeria, at least 190 people have been reported killed in the conflict between Algerian security forces and Moslem fundamentalists, according to independent and other sources.

The latest attacks followed a lull in raids on isolated communities since the November 28 referendum.

"Arm us. We cannot defend ourselves with our bare chests," villagers shouted at Solidarity Minister Rabea Mechernene when he visited Ben-Salah village after one November attack.

Algeria's Armed Islamic Group (GIA) is suspected of being responsible for most of the attacks whose ruthlessness has stunned even Algerians inured to violence after five years of conflict in which about 60,000 people have been killed.

The GIA is thought to be behind the latest bomb attack in France this week in which three people were killed and 94 wounded.
