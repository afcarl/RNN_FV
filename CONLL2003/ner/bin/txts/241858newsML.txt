French paper says Chirac to announce reshuffle.

PARIS 1996-12-07

A French newspaper said on Saturday President Jacques Chirac would announce a government reshuffle in a special television appearance this week, but his office declined to confirm or deny the report.

The weekly Le Journal du Dimanche wrote that Chirac would retain unpopular Prime Minister Alain Juppe but would reshuffle other cabinet posts which it did not identity.

"I cannot confirm or deny anything about such an event," a presidency spokesman said.

French newspapers have reported for several weeks that Chirac, whose own stock is also near its lowest since his May 1995 election, was preparing a television appearance to seek to regain his credibility.

Chirac's centre-right government has been buffeted by rising unemployment and mounting dissent on coalition backbenches over austerity policies imposed to qualify France for a single European currency.
