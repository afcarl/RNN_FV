<headline>French paper says Chirac to announce reshuffle.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-12-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>A French newspaper said on Saturday President Jacques Chirac would announce a government reshuffle in a special television appearance this week, but his office declined to confirm or deny the report.</p>
<p>The weekly Le Journal du Dimanche wrote that Chirac would retain unpopular Prime Minister Alain Juppe but would reshuffle other cabinet posts which it did not identity.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot confirm or deny anything about such an event,&quot; a presidency spokesman said.</p>
<p>French newspapers have reported for several weeks that Chirac, whose own stock is also near its lowest since his May 1995 election, was preparing a television appearance to seek to regain his credibility.</p>
<p>Chirac's centre-right government has been buffeted by rising unemployment and mounting dissent on coalition backbenches over austerity policies imposed to qualify France for a single European currency.</p>
