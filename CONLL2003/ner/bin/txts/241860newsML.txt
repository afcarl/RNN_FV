EU's de Silguy sees Dublin summit success.

PARIS 1996-12-07

European Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy said in an newspaper interview appearing on Sunday he did not believe wrangling over a budgetary discipline pact would prevent success at a summit of European Union leaders next week.

"I do not see how it could fail," said de Silguy, who is in charge of economic affairs at the Commission in Brussels.

"As far as the (budget) stability pact is concerned, it's three-quarters sorted out," he told the French Sunday weekly Journal du Dimanche.

EU leaders meet in Dublin next Friday and Saturday.

One of the key issues will be a "stability pact" proposed by Germany to make sure that countries keep their deficits within the three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) laid down in the Mastricht treaty after they create a single euro currency.

But EU states are wrangling over Germany's call for strict numerical evaluation of the circumstances under which a higher deficit could be tolerated without the country concerned being open to fines.

"I do not believe an issue like this could trip up the summit," de Silguy said.
