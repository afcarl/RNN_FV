<title>FRANCE: Zaire force now out of question -- French minister.</title>
<headline>Zaire force now out of question -- French minister.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-12-07</dateline>

<p>The French minister in charge of African affairs said in comments released on Saturday that the international military force for Zaire which France pressed the world to create was no longer viable.</p>
<p>&quot;It's now out of the question (for the force to be deployed),&quot; Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain told the weekly newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche.</p>
<p>French authorities had so far said they still backed the idea of a multinational force commanded by a Canadian general and aimed at deploying in anarchic eastern Zaire to ensure aid reached refugees from neighbouring Rwanda and displaced Zaireans.</p>
<p>But the force has been unable to get off the ground due to opposition from the Kinshasa government and Rwandan-backed rebels, as well as because of apparent lack of enthusiasm by some contributor countries when hundreds of thousands of refugees began heading home.</p>
<p>Godfrain said the priority now was the organisation of a conference of countries from Africa's Great Lakes region to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>Godfrain, who sparked a controversy with the United States over its African policy in October, said Paris wanted Washington to increase financial aid to African states.</p>
<p>&quot;France is now top contributor per inhabitant and the U.S. is only fourth. Moreover they slashed their contributions by 20 percent this year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't fear the U.S. (as competition in Africa). We only fear the U.S. will lower its aid to development even more.</p>
<p>&quot;It's stylish to say the U.S. is gaining influence in Africa and France is on the way out. But like all stylish ideas, it will go out of style itself. France is a friend for good days and bad. We're not there for commercial coups only,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Godfrain sparked anger in the State Department when he said in October the United States administration was only interested in Africa at election-time in order to reap votes from African-Americans.</p>
