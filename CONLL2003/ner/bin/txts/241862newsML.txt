Italy industrialist criticises government.

MILAN 1996-12-07

Giorgio Fossa, head of Italy's influential Confindustria industrialists group, said on Saturday that if the goverment did not do more to help business it would be swept away.

"If the government doesn't change course, the country itself will sweep it away," Fossa told a business convention in Milan.

"We have a government which should make it easier for companies to create new jobs and instead it raises taxes and therefore does not understand the reality of the country," he said.

Leaders of Prime Minister Romano Prodi's centre-left government, which took office last May, criticised Fossa.

"Such a radical statement by a man who holds such an important position in our economy is on the limits of irresponsibility," said Mauro Zani of the ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the largest coalition party.

Members of the opposition centre-right Freedom Alliance welcomed Fossa's comments.
