<p>The German government will not abandon a private agent detained in Colombia on suspicion of paying a ransom to get a German kidnap victim freed, the coordinater of Bonn's intelligence services said.</p>
<p>In a newspaper interview published on Saturday, Bernd Schmidbauer defended the government's role in a case which has outraged Colombia, where authorities have made ransom payments illegal to try to stop money going to rebels.</p>
<p>Schmidbauer told the Welt am Sonntag the fact that he had not been asked to resign by any political party was proof that the government agreed unconventional methods were justified to solve humanitarian cases.</p>
<p>Werner Mauss, who has long-standing experience of kidnapping cases in Colombia and good contacts with the rebels, was arrested with his wife in mid-November as he tried to fly out of the South American country with German kidnap victim Brigitte Schoene.</p>
<p>Mauss and his wife could count on the government not leaving them in the lurch after helping it in so many cases, Schmidbauer said.</p>
<p>Welt am Sonntag said it had information showing the arrest of Mauss and his wife was down to a group of former agents of the American and British secret services, linked to a private group.</p>
<p>The agents are believed to have made deals with the ELN guerrillas and paid ransom money to free foreigners and Mauss would have been one of their competitors, the paper said.</p>
<p>Colombia has accused Mauss of being a member of the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla group.</p>
<p>When asked if Germany would stop helping kidnap victims because of the arrest of Mauss and his wife, Schmidbauer said: &quot;We will have more cases where German citizens are taken hostage. We are duty-bound to help them in such situations.&quot;</p>
