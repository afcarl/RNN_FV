Allianz wants out of BHF-Bank stake - Spiegel.

BONN 1996-12-07

Germany's Allianz Holding is seeking to dispose of its 15.2 percent holding in Frankfurt-based BHF-Bank at a price of 480 million marks, Spiegel magazine said on Saturday in an article from next Monday's edition.

No comment could be obtained from insurer Allianz, which according to Spiegel believes BHF's financial securities skills no longer mesh with its corporate strategy.

BHF has been hit by adverse price movements in some of its most important shareholdings, which have eroded its financial reserves, Spiegel said, adding that Allianz is finding it hard to attract a buyer.
