<p>The supervisory board of utility group Viag has ordered management to pursue a low-risk strategy and seek new partners for its move into the telecommunications business, the Spiegel news weekly reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The magazine, in an article released from next Monday's edition, said that Viag managers had also been cleared to invest six billion marks on its telecoms ventures.</p>
<p>Viag has a telecoms alliance with British Telecom, which is believed to be the only bidder seeking Germany's fourth mobile phone licence. The group was recently rocked after RWE quit to team up with Veba and Cable &amp; Wireless.</p>
<p>A Viag spokesman rejected the Spiegel report of a new company strategy, and said that a recent supervisory board meeting had discussed operations in existing business areas.</p>
<p>The spokesman also said that it was already known that new partners were being sought in the communications area, adding that the planned six billion marks in investment would be split between Viag and BT.</p>
<p>Spiegel also said that Viag was seeking to sell Ameriquest, the U.S. computer retail unit of its Computer 2000 chain. The spokesman said that option was one of many being considered which also included finding a strategic partner.</p>
