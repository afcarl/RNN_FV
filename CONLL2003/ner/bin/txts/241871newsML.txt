Cr Foncier vice-chairman ousted by law.

PARIS 1996-12-07

French Credit Foncier vice-chairman Jean-Pascal Beaufret has quit after France's top constitutional court quashed the presidential decree naming him to the post because of a conflict with his former job as Treasury official.

The property loans group said in a statement he had quit as of December 6.

A shareholder had sought Beaufret's resignation under a law which prohibits civil servants from moving into a private sector job in the same sector they handled during their time in the civil service.

Beaufret was one of the main Credit Foncier directors behind the decision to write huge provisions into the group's 1995 accounts, which resulted in a 10.8 billion franc loss for 1995.

The loss triggered a plan by Finance Minister Jean Arthuis to put the group into "managed wind-down", a move which is being fought by trade unions and some politicians who argue that the provisions were excessive and that the group could be saved.

Credit Foncier has since posted a first half profit in excess of 400 million francs and, according to chairman Jerome Meyssonier, could make a profit of one billion francs this year. --Paris Newsroom +33 1 4221 5452
