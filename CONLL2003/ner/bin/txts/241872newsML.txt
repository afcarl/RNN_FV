Dutch Sport7 channel fails after just four months.

AMSTERDAM 1996-12-07

New Dutch TV channel Sport7 said on Saturday it is to cease broadcasting at Sunday midnight after shareholders decided late Friday night to cut off financial aid.

"Sport7's risk-bearing shareholders...have decided they will no longer make good the losses," the channel said in a statement.

It said that as a result of the decision it would seek court protection from creditors, which it expected to be granted next week.

Sport7, the Netherlands' first sports-only channel, is owned jointly by PTT Nederland, ING, Philips Electronics and Dutch television producers John de Mol and Joop van den Ende, publisher De Telegraaf, Dutch soccer association KNVB and cable firm Telekabel.

In less than four months of operations Sport7's losses have mounted to at least 100 million guilders, undermined by poor viewing figures and protracted wrangling over broadcasting rights for Dutch major league soccer matches.

Dutch soccer association KNVB sold exclusive rights for Dutch league soccer to Sport7 in a seven-year deal worth 140 million guilders a year.

But KNVB's entitlement to do so was later challenged in the courts by Feyenoord Rotterdam, currently riding high in the Dutch first division.

The club initially lost its case, but won an interim judgement on appeal. A final decision is still pending.

"KNVB has been unable to clarify the question of whether and (if so) to what extent the soccer association is entitled to licence the rights of the affiliated clubs," Sport7 said.

"As a result the KNVB has failed more than once to meet its commitments to Sport7 due to a lack of cooperation from KNVB members."

Even now it was still uncertain whether the agreements between the KNVB and its members were valid in law, it said.

The soccer association, which took no part in Friday night's meeting of shareholders, said early Saturday its board of professional football headed by Jos Staatsen had "drawn the consequences from the state of affairs surrounding Sport7" and resigned.

Sport7 said the channel had been further hampered by "political pressure" to sub-licence Dutch public broadcaster NOS.

Under the sub-licencing agreement NOS gained the rights to broadcast match highlights of all first division games, thereby undermining Sport7's exclusivity.

Shareholders' spokesman and former Philips president Jan Timmer said the channel's collapse was a loss for all concerned.

"(The shareholders) deeply regret this decision because they still believe that a sports(-only) channel is in the interests of both sport and viewers," he told reporters after Friday night's meeting.

The broadcasting rights will now revert to the KNVB. Holland Media Group, which operates channels RTL4 and RTL5, has already informed the soccer association it plans to team up with Filmnet and public broadcaster NOS in a possible fresh bid for the rights, ANP news agency said on Saturday. --Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040
