Kvaerner wins Woodside deal - paper.

OSLO 1996-12-07

A Norwegian newspaper said on Saturday that Kvaerner Oil & Gas, a part of Norway's Kvaerner ASA group, has been awarded a 2.7 billion crown contract to build a floating production ship for Woodside Petroleum's Laminaria Field off Australia.

"Kvaerner's Oil & Gas division has landed the contract with the Australian oil company Woodside Petroleum," financial daily Dagens Naeringsliv said in a frontpage report.

"Kvaerner has thus managed to shake off (U.S.) competitor Brown & Root in the final bidding round," it said, quoting "good sources".

London-based Kvaerner has been among the bidders to supply Woodside with a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) oil facility for the Laminaria oil field.

Woodside has been widely expected to make a decision this month on the Laminaria field, but Kvaerner refuses to confirm a deal has now been made, Dagens Naeringsliv said.

The newspaper added, however: "Both parties have now signed everything there is to be signed, except for the official final signature. It is expected that Woodside Petroleum will issue a press release on the contract in the middle of this month."

News reports have said the planned FPSO, with a process capacity of 140-170,000 barrels per day of oil and a storage capacity of 1.4 million barrels of oil, will be the largest in Australia.

The ship is to be completed at the end of 1998, according to Dagens Naeringsliv.
