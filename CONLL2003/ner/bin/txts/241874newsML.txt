German SPD to make wealth tax an election issue.

BONN 1996-12-07

Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD) vowed on Saturday to turn their climbdown over the government's scrapping of wealth taxes into a vote winner when it comes to general elections in 1998.

Party leader Oskar Lafontaine accused Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government of "ice-cold blackmail" in forcing through the abolition of the tax despite the opposition of the SPD majority in the Bundesrat upper house of parliament.

The SPD caved in this week over the wealth tax issue in a months-long wrangle over the 1997 tax bill, which is now likely to pass into law before the end of the year.

Faced with an SPD veto in the Bundesrat, the government had threatened to let the tax bill fail. That would have meant that the wealth tax -- ruled illegal by the constitutional court -- would have been removed next year anyway.

"It is a political scandal. It is not acceptable that millionaires get a tax giveway worth billions of marks, while workers pay ever more taxes," Lafontaine told Cologne's Sunday Express newspaper in an article released ahead of publication.

The row over the wealth tax is a foretaste of the political debate likely to develop as the 1998 elections approach.

The passage of major reforms to the country's labyrinthine tax system in 1998 or 1999 has climbed to the top of the political agenda and will be decisive in determining whether Germany can stay the course within European monetary union.

All parties in Germany agree on the need to cut income tax rates and broaden the revenue base by scrapping tax breaks.

The main proposal favoured by Finance Minister Theo Waigel is to sink the entry rate to around 20 percent from 26 percent now, while cutting the top rate from 53 percent to 35 percent.

Junior coalition partners the Free Democrats (FDP) now say the income tax cuts should go further. FDP chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt called in a magazine interview for the entry rate to fall as low as 10 percent.

That, Gerhardt told Focus magazine's Monday edition, would encourage more Germans to take lower-paid jobs. Unemployment in November hit a post-unification record 4.1 million, seasonally adjusted, data showed this week.

Leaders of Germany's main political parties are also mulling raising value-added tax -- not to finance tax reforms, but to help relieve the burden on the social security system.

Heiner Geissler, social affairs spokesman of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), told Focus hiking VAT to pay for tax cuts would be "socially grotesque".

But, he said, a one-point increase "as soon as possible" could be used to help cut high German labour costs -- seen as a deterrent to hiring workers.

"That would be economically correct and would have an impact on the jobs market," Geissler said.

Waigel is leading a tax commission of Christian Democrats and the FDP on finalising a reform plan. But, Focus said, the commission is struggling to agree a compromise on tax rates and its final report may now be delayed into the new year.
