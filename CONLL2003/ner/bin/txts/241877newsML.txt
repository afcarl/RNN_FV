Russian spy says Kremlin ring in Bonn - weekly.

BONN 1996-12-07

German authorities are examining data handed over by a Russian secret service defector, which contains hundreds of references to Russian spies supposedly operating in German government circles, Focus magazine said.

In an issue released ahead of publication on Monday, the magazine quoted reliable sources as saying a renegade officer of the Russian secret service had given extensive material from the KGB record office to the British secret service. Earlier this year the British handed the files over to Germany.

Focus said the files suggested political parties of all shades, business associations, the judiciary and police authorities had been penetrated by spies.

First insights from the investigation on Moscow's spy ring in Germany, operating under the codename "Weekend", will be released soon by federal prosecutors, Focus said.
