VW still seeks friendly deal over GM secrets charges.

Embattled German carmaker Volkswagen (VW) still hopes it can reach a friendly settlement with General Motors over allegations it stole industrial secrets, a senior VW official said on Saturday.

Walter Leisler Kiep, a member of VW's supervisory board who initiated closed-door talks with GM in September on ending the three-year-long dispute, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper there were "realistic chances of an amicable agreement".

GM is seeking massive compensation in a U.S. civil suit over the alleged stealing of confidential data by Spanish purchasing boss Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who moved from GM's German unit Adam Opel to VW in 1993.

Lopez resigned from VW last week, but has been invited by chief executive Ferdinand Piech to stay on as a consultant and his contract will be honoured through to 1998.

That has not been enough to satisfy the Detroit car giant's demand for a complete severance of ties, a full apology, acceptance of responsibility by VW for the damage to GM's business and the payment of compensation.

Kiep, speaking to Bild am Sonntag in an interview to be published on Sunday, rejected the renewed demands by GM as "completely unacceptable".

He added that neither side had any interest in a legal battle which could stretch on for three or four years and which "could escalate into a battle of unimaginable proportions which exceeds all the bounds of competition.

"It could result in German-American relations suffering long-term damage, because both companies are national symbols".

The head of competing German carmaker Mercedes, Helmut Werner, said on Saturday the VW-GM row was already hitting bilateral relations and damaging German industry.

"The row between VW and General Motors is neither good for German industry nor for German-American relations," Werner told Saturday's edition of the newspaper.

He added there were good chances that VW's Piech would be able "to clear up the situation". Mercedes is a unit of Daimler-Benz AG.

Kiep, a former senior official in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrat party (CDU) and ex-finance minister in Lower Saxony state -- where VW is based -- said he hoped to broker a further meeting between executives of the two companies.

But, he added, the meeting would depend on when German prosecutors open criminal proceedings in a separate case against Lopez over the industrial espionage allegations. That could happen as early as next week, he told Bild am Sonntag.

Separately, Focus magazine quoted legal experts as saying that if VW is required to pay compensation to GM over the espionage claims, the board could also be liable to the company's lenders and shareholders.

The magazine quoted the experts as saying the VW board could be liable for damages if management "grievously violated the duty of care of a proper and conscientious executive".

The experts did not agree on whether shareholders could seek compensation if the value of their VW stock fell as a result of the GM action.
