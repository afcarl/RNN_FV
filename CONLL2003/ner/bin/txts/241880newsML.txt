Algeria privatises stores for $7.1 million.

PARIS 1996-12-07

Algeria's state-run Entreprise des Galeries d'Oran (EDGO) has sold four "supermarket-type shops" to Algerians for a total of 390 million dinars ($7.1 million), the official Algerian news agency APS said on Saturday.

The agency said the four in the western city of Oran had been closed for more than a year because of financial problems. Bids for the shops were between 10 and 30 percent higher than the offer price.

They were among seven offered for sale by EDGO.

Similar state-run enterprises in eight other cities have offered a total of 37 supermarkets for sale, APS said.

"With this operation, Oran appears to have become the pioneer in privatisation," the agency said.

"From 12 tourist hotels in different parts of the country offered for sale in 1994 and 1996 only the Chateauneuf Hotel in Oran has found a buyer."
