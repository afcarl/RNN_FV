France confirms asked for European aid on blast.

PARIS 1996-12-07

France has asked other European countries, including Germany, to help to track down those responsible for a blast on a Paris commuter train last Tuesday in which three people died, the Interior Ministry said on Saturday.

But the ministry refused to confirm or deny a French television report saying Paris had send its neighbours a list of 13 people suspected of involvement in the attack.  

"We indeed addressed a request for cooperation from German police as well as to police in other European countries," a ministry spokesman told Reuters.

"This move is part of the routine investigations and verifications that we have initiated in the framework of this investigation," he said.

In Bonn, German police confirmed French authorities had asked them to help track down the bombers but added that they were not actively searching for suspects.
