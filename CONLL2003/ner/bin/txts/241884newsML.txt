French to continue fishing in Sark Box.

PARIS 1996-12-07

French fishermen will continue to fish in the Sark Box near the British Channel island of Guernsey while talks to solve a dispute over fishing rights there continue, the French Agriculture Ministry said on Saturday.

"After the tension of the past days, this is a first tangible result," the ministry said in a statement.

The statement followed talks between France and Britain on Friday to try to resolve the dispute triggered when Britain unilaterally withdrew from a 1994 agreement granting fishing rights to France in the zone.

French trawlers defied the ban on their fishing in the zone last week but Guernsey officials avoided a confrontation by taking no action.

Talks on the ban will resume in January, the statement added.
