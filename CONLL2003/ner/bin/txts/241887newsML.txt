PARIS 1996-12-07

Algerian President Liamine Zeroual on Saturday signed into law constitutional reforms which will ban political parties based on religion or language, the official Algerian news agency APS said.

The changes, aimed at helping Algeria end five years of violence in which about 60,000 people have died, were approved in a referendum last month.
