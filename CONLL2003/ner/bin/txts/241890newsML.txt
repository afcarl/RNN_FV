U.N. chief says world has to move on slavery.

UNITED NATIONS 1996-12-06

Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali called on governments to pay more than lip service to the abolition of slavery, forced labour and child prostitution.

Addressing the U.N. General Assembly on Friday on the International Day for the Abolition of Slavery, he told member states: "I urge you to address these issues with urgency and a renewed sense of outrage."

While nearly every country in the world had outlawed and condemned slavery, he said it was far from dead. The contemporary form of slavery included debt bondage, forced labour, sexual and physical abuse of servants and the sale of women into prostitution.

"The traffic in in persons is now a highly organised and international trade with links to organised crime," he said.

"It is a trade which mainly affects young women and girls. It can and often does lead to prostitution, forced domestic service and pornography," he said.

"In the late 20th century, this situation is simply unacceptable."

Boutros-Ghali did not name any states, but the world body's international labour organisation recently reported that child slavery and forced bondage was being practiced in South and Southeast Asia and West Africa.

In Asia, it estimated that a million children were victims of the sex trade with Thailand a well-established route for trafficking. But the problem was growing in India, Bangladesh and the Phillipines as well.

In Africa reports have pointed to traditional slavery in Mauritania and forced labour during Sierra Leone's civil war.

In Latin America girls have been sold into prostitution to Europe and the Middle East, particularly the Gulf States. In Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, girls have been sold to Hungary, Poland or Western Europe.

Separate U.N. reports have pointed to abduction of children for forced labour in the Sudan. In Burma, the government is retivalitizing the country's infrastructure though forced labour.

Boutros-Ghali said that physical force and abuse were widespread with victims often misled by promised of honest work in a foreign country.

"Women and girl victims of prostitution face the most appalling exploitation," he said. "They are usually held captive, their passports confiscated and they are frequently subject to physical as well as sexual abuse. This is a truly global problem."
