UN chief, Security Council congratulate Albright.

UNITED NATIONS 1996-12-06

U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali congratulated U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright on her nomination for U.S. Secretary of State, the United Nations said on Friday.

Her Security Council colleagues did the same shortly after Albright attended a council meeting after returning from Washington where President Bill Clinton announced her candidacy on Thursday.

Although Albright is mainly responsible for Washington's opposing Boutros-Ghali's bid for re-election, the secretary-general telephoned her to say "how happy" he was at her appointment, U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said.

"We all know that Ambassador Albright has been a really passionate supporter of the United Nations and this is a good thing for us," she said. "So we are very very happy for her and for the United Nations because now we do have a real advocate there."

In the 15-seat Security Council, its current president, Paolo Fulci of Italy told reporters that "members of the council said that President Clinton could not have picked a stronger, more qualified, energetic and highly talented person to lead American foreign policy into the year 2000."

Travelling by train from Washington, Albright received a jubilant welcome from her staff at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, across the street from U.N. headquarters.

Beaming, she kissed her deputy, Edward Gnehm and hugged many other staff. The 59-year-old Czech-born Albright will become the first woman ever to hold the post.
