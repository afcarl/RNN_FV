Printing giant Donnelley slammed at public forum.

CHICAGO 1996-12-07

More than two dozen people accused printing giant R.R. Donnelley & Sons of racism and age discrimination in a public forum  Saturday organized by Rev. Jesse Jackson and his Rainbow PUSH Action Network.

Present at the hearing, held in the wake of a recent $500 million lawsuit against R.R. Donnelley & Sons alleging race and age discrimination, were several government officials, including the Labor Department's undersecretary for the Employee Standards Administration, Bernard Anderson.

"This is very painful for all of us to hear," Anderson said.

"Be not dismayed," he said. "We're on your side."

Jackson, spearheading a "major drive for fairness for workers in the workplace," urged Donnelley workers and others to remain vocal in their fight against corporate racism and age discrimination.

The lion's share of the grievances came from current and former R.R. Donnelley workers, but a handful of complaints of alleged mistreatment at Ford Motor Company and the U.S. Postal Service were also heard.

R.R. Donnelley is the world's largest commercial printer and publishes phone books, magazines, newspaper inserts, government documents and other material.
