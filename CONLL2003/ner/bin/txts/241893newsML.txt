Mattel says key claim in lawsuit dismissed.

LOS ANGELES 1996-12-07

Mattel Inc said on Saturday a Superior Court judge has dismissed a key claim in a wrongful termination lawsuit filed against it by a former executive.

Mattel spokesman Glenn Bozarth said Judge Stephen O'Neil had dismissed a "whistleblowing" allegation filed by Michelle Greenwald, a former Mattel senior vice president who was fired in July 1995.

"The charges were baseless, and the judge this week confirmed our position," Bozarth said in a telephone interview.

Other wrongful termination charges were still pending in the case. Greenwald has accused Mattel of accounting irregularities and wrongful termination.
