Seagram Co Ltd's MCA Inc and Viacom Inc ended testimony Friday in an embittered court battle over their joint-ownership of USA Networks.

At issue in the case is whether Viacom's launch of "Nick at Nite TV Land" and Viacom's MTV network violate the terms of the partnership, which prohibits either firm from operating or launching entertainment cable networks outside USA Network.

A decision is not expected until April or May, a source close to the case told Reuters.

There were no closing summary arguments, but the final  day of evidence taking ended with testimony by Seagram attorney George Krouse who confirmed Seagram chief executive  Edgar Bronfman's assertion the MTV Networks were not included in the oral agreement between Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone and Bronfman.

Both sides are tentatively scheduled to submit sealed post-trial summaries of their competing lawsuits on January 17 with reply briefs due February 7. Following that, Vice Chancellor Myron Steele of Delaware Chancery Court will schedule a one-day hearing for oral arguments.

MCA claims Viacom's ownership of MTV Networks violates a non-compete provision of the 1981 USA Networks agreement prohibiting the partners from owning any "advertiser-supported basic cable entertainment networks" outside the partnership.

MCA has asked Viacom to either divest its holdings in MTV or be ordered by the court to sell its USA Networks interest.

Viacom has said the partnership is working, that MTV networks were grandfathered into the agreement, and that MCA's attempt to enforce a non-compete provision of the partnership is a violation of anti-trust laws.

Redstone has previously testified Bronfman broke his promise not to sue Viacom over MTV if Redstone would release ousted Viacom chief executive Frank Biondi from a non-compete contract with Viacom.

Redstone complied and Biondi was appointed chief executive of MCA in April.

But according to Bronfman's testimony, his only promise to Redstone was to exempt Viacom's recent launch of Nick-At-Nite's TV Land, not all of the MTV networks.

The 19 day trial began October 15 but was interrupted for scheduling conflicts and settlement negotiations, which proved unsuccessful.

At that time, it was reported that Viacom had agreed to buy out MCA's half of the partnership for about $1.7 billion dollars, but that negotiations broke off when MCA balked at the high tax burden it would have to pay.

MCA has insisted it is no longer interested in selling. Sources at Viacom have indicated to Reuters that Viacom might sell its half of USA Networks if the price were right.

According to a source, the two companies have not resumed talks.
