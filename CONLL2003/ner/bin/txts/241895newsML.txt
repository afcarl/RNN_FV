Thomas & Betts sets final terms with Augat.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. 1996-12-06

Thomas & Betts Corp said on Friday that the exchange ratio for its proposed merger with Augat Inc was set at 0.6356 of a Thomas & Betts common share for each share of Augat.

The exchange ratio is based on the average closing price per share of Thomas & Betts common stock for the 20 trading days ended December 6, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement between Thomas & Betts and Augat on October 7.

Because the $44.40 average closing price of Thomas & Betts common stock for this 20-day trading period was more than $41.50 per share (the maximum price at which an earlier exchange ratio of 0.6800 would apply), the exchange ratio was computed by dividing $28.22 by the average closing price, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement.

The company said that both its shareholders and Augat's shareholders will meet on December 11 to vote on the proposed merger.
