USAir says BA must separate itself from USAir.

ARLINGTON, Va. 1996-12-06

USAir Group Inc said late on Friday that the British government's decision to impose conditions on the British Airways PLC, American Airlines' proposed merger sent a message that BA must separate itself from USAir to allow competition.

"The U.K government has sent a clear message that British Airways must separate itself from USAir so that we can compete in the important U.S.-U.K. marketplace," USAir said in a statement.  

The airline, said, however, that much more had to be done to ensure that sufficient slots and ground facilities existed for new competitors.

It said it will continue to pursue "aggressively" its goal of becoming a full and effective competitor at London's Heathrow Airport.

The British government said on Friday that British Airways and AMR Corp must drop 168 slots a week at London Heathrow airport and reduce services on the London to Dallas Fort Worth route.  BA would also be required to drop a clause in its pact with USAir that prevents USAir from competing on transatlantic routes.
