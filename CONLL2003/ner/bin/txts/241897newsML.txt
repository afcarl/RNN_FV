WOODBURY, N.Y. 1996-12-06

Jennifer Convertibles Inc said on Friday that its independent auditors, Richard A. Eisner & Co LLP, affirmed the company's consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the 1996 fiscal year, but did not express an opinion on the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for fiscal 1995.

The company said the auditors determined that fiscal 1996 statements and balance sheet as of August 31, 1996, were presented fairly and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

The firm also audited the company's balance sheet as of August 26, 1995, and determined that it was fair and conformed to accounting principles, the company said.
