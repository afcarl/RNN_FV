World energy policy weighed with eye on emerging markets.

Oil producing and consuming countries meeting on Saturday weighed ways to meet the world's growing energy needs at prices emerging economies, like host India, can afford.

Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer, reassured consumers world oil supplies are more secure than ever despite prices now nearing six year highs.

But that was little consolation for oil importers in the developing world, who are sweating under the strain put on their trade and budget deficits by rising prices.

Robert Priddle, head of the west's International Energy Agency, warned consumers not to be complacent about expectations of ample oil supplies, adding that cost cutting by oil companies reducing stocks could leave them vulnerable to price shocks.

North Sea Brent crude prices neared a post-Gulf War high of $25.06 per barrel this week, supported by low inventories, which are 67 million barrels less than a year ago.

The world's major oil producers say prices in real terms, that is stripping out inflation, have been too low for too long and they need the money to ensure there is enough oil for the future.

"If the prices are not right the investment will not flow," said Rilwanu Lukman, secretary-general of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

"Ultimately you will end up with very low supplies and high demand and therefore prices will shoot up (to) $30 to $40 a barrel and that will be even worse for countries like India."

He said some studies have shown that 80 percent of the money being invested in oil is going into non-OPEC countries even though they only hold 25 percent of the world's known oil reserves.

"There is an imbalance (of investment in OPEC and non-OPEC countries) which needs to be addressed, that if not taken care of over a period of time could lead to disruption."

The spotlight at the conference has fallen firmly on the huge market potential of developing countries, particularly in Asia.

"The high rates of economic growth of these economies has put them at the centre stage in world economic relations and the world energy map into the next century," said Saudi Arabia's Deputy Minister of Petroleum Affairs Abdulaziz Bin Salman Al Saud.

Developing countries' share of world energy demand should rise to 40 percent by 2010 from 28 percent now, he said.

The dozens of countries attending the International Energy Conference, being held in the India's tourist resort state of Goa, are also discussing massive investments needed by the energy sector to keep pace with the expanding global economy.

Analysts estimate Asia alone needs more than $1 trillion in investment this decade to meet its growing energy needs.

Previous producer-consumer meetings, established after the Gulf War oil price scare in 1991, have done little to narrow the philosophical rift between buyers and sellers.

But each conference has paid lip service to the need for cooperation and agreed price and supply stablity are a must.

This year both Norway and Venezuela have proposed that the conference set up a world body to help formulate global energy policy covering a range of issues for consumption requirements, investment, laws, taxes and environmental issues.

Speakers at the morning session agreed there was also a need to protect the environment while sustaining economic growth.

However, OPEC heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Iran called on industrialised nations to avoid introducing environmental taxes on oil that would have repercussions on investment and prices that would hurt the developing world.

Developing nations should not have to curtail energy demand to meet the growing environmental demands of established industrial nations, the Saudi deputy energy minister said.

Saudi Arabia and Iran also called on governments to make sure trade barriers did not block the huge investments necessary for projects to meet growing oil and gas demand.

Britain's minister of state for trade Lord Fraser said Asian consuming nations can also help themselves by building more oil stockpiles and opening their industries to competition.
