Doctors delay bid to fix Mother Teresa's heartbeat.

Doctors postponed an attempt to correct Mother Teresa's irregular heartbeat on Saturday, saying the 86-year-old nun needed more time to recover from life-saving surgery.

Doctors treating the ailing Roman Catholic missionary at Calcutta's B.M. Birla Medical Research Centre said in a regular medical bulletin that they would consider regulating her heartbeat with drugs or electric shock when she was more stable.

"An attempt for cardioversion will be comtemplated when she is more stable," the bulletin said.

Cardioversion involves the use of drugs or a mild electric shock to remove irregularities in the heartbeat, doctors said.

The 1979 Nobel peace prize winner underwent surgery on November 29 to clear two blocked coronary arteries, her third such operation in five years.

Mother Teresa, who was fitted with a heart pacemaker in 1989, was given a controlled electric shock when she was last in hospital for heart failure in August.

Last week doctors held off performing another cardioversion while she recovered from surgery. As she had gained strength in recent days, doctors had planned to try to correct her heartbeat with drugs on Saturday.

The medical bulletin said Mother Teresa's doctors were satisfied with her progress.

"Even though her improvement is slow and (she is) not out of danger, physicians are pleased so far with her progress," the doctors said.

Mother Teresa has been reluctant to undergo "mechanical" cardioversion, involving a weak electric shock, her doctors said.

Dr Tarun Praharaj said doctors would first try to regulate Mother Teresa's heartbeat with drugs. "We will go first for pharmacological cardioversion," he said. If that failed, they would consider administering a mild shock.

In the last few days Mother Teresa has frequently urged doctors to let her resume her work with the sick and dying that won her the title "Saint of the Gutters".

"I will go home tomorrow," one clinic official quoted her as telling him on Saturday. "She's absolutely alert," he added.

But she was not likely to leave the clinic any time soon, he added.

Praharaj cautioned that Mother Teresa's recovery would be slow, and that she might never be as active as before.
