<p>Police detained several hundred supporters of India's most visible woman politician, Jayaram Jayalalitha, after she was arrested in a corruption case on Saturday, United News of India (UNI) said.</p>
<p>The news agency said some 400 supporters were taken into custody in various parts of the southern state of Tamil Nadu, where Jayalalitha was chief minister until she was toppled in elections in May.</p>
<p>Several leaders of Jayalalitha's All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) party were detained during protests against her arrest, UNI said.</p>
<p>Police said Jayalalitha, a former movie idol, was charged with ordering some 85 million rupees' ($2.4 million) worth of excess spending on 45,302 television sets for villagers while she was Tamil Nadu's chief minister. She denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Since her party was trounced in state elections in May, Jayalalitha, 48, has been charged in seven corruption cases ranging from foreign exchange to income tax violations.</p>
<p>Talking to reporters at the Tamil Nadu police chief's office after her arrest in the state capital Madras, Jayalalitha said: &quot;This is nothing but political victimisation.&quot;</p>
<p>State judge A. Ramamurthy remanded the former movie star to judicial custody until December 21.</p>
<p>Police charged Jayalalitha with overruling state authorities who in 1995 had objected to the purchase price of 14,500 rupees ($400) per colour television set, which they claimed was inflated, news agencies said.</p>
<p>The television sets were provided to villagers as part of a scheme which Jayalalitha's government said aimed to enrich community education and entertainment.</p>
<p>Police alleged that some of the money paid to television set makers was returned to state officials as kickbacks.</p>
<p>Some 40 AIADMK party workers, including the deputy general secretary K. Kalimuthu, were detained in Madurai on Saturday when they blocked a road near the railway station, UNI said.</p>
<p>Jayalalitha supporters threw stones at vehicles in several parts of the state including Madras, it said. Shops in parts of Madras closed their doors for the day, it said.</p>
<p>Jayalalitha quit films in 1982 after a successful acting career to become one of India's most powerful regional politicians.</p>
<p>She took over the AIADMK, a party representing low-caste Hindus and Tamil speakers, from her former co-star, matinee idol M.G. Ramachandran, after his death in 1997.</p>
<p>As chief minister, she built up a personality cult, erecting huge plyboard cutouts of herself around Madras and proclaiming her development successes on giant hoardings during elections.</p>
<p>But disillusionment set in with what many Tamils saw as her extravagant lifestyle and increasingly autocratic manner.</p>
<p>More than half of the 27 members of her former cabinet face criminal or corruption cases.</p>
