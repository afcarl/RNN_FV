Sri Lanka military chiefs safe after air scare.

COLOMBO 1996-12-07

A military helicopter carrying Sri Lanka's deputy defence minister and army chief crash-landed in rebel territory in the country's north on Saturday, but both men are safe, a military official said.

The helicopter, with minister Anuruddha Ratwatte and army commander Lieutenant-General Rohan Daluwatte, came down in country controlled by the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam north of the town of Vavuniya, about 220 km (135 miles) from the capital Colombo.

"It had crash-landed after experiencing mechanical trouble," the official told Reuters.

Airborne troops rushed to the crash-landing site at remote Pompaimadu, ahead of the army's frontline, and brought the minister and his party to Vavunia air force base, military officials said.

Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga is the defence minister, but Ratwatte effectively controls day-to-day operations. He is also Irrigation, Power and Energy Minister.

Ratwatte and Daluwatte are widely credited with the military's recent victories over the Tigers, including last December's recapture of the rebels' strategic northern stronghold of Jaffna.

Ratwatte, popular with the troops, has a reputation for frequent visits to battle zones.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravinatha Ariyasinha told Reuters the men were safe and had returned to Colombo.

"The deputy defence minister's helicopter made an emergency landing. However, he and all on board are safe. They were flown back to Colombo in the afternoon," he said.

No further details were immediately available.

The Sri Lankan government has been embroiled in an ethnic war since 1983 against Tamil Tiger rebels demanding a separate homeland in the north and east of this predominantly Sinhalese Indian Ocean island.

The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the conflict, but the Tigers say the death toll is much higher.

Kumaratunga's government launched a concerted military offensive against the Tigers after peace talks broke down last year and has recaptured key territory.
