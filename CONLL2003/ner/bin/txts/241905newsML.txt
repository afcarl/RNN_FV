Doctors to try to fix Mother Teresa's heartbeat.

Doctors treating Mother Teresa said they would try to correct the 86-year old nun's irregular heartbeat on Saturday with drugs or mild electric shock.

A panel of doctors treating the ailing Roman Catholic missionary at Calcutta's B.M. Birla Medical Research Centre said in a regular medical bulletin that they would carry out cardioversion to try to stabilise her heartbeat.

Doctors had delayed the procedure while Mother Teresa recovered from life-saving heart surgery last week. But she has gained strength in recent days.

"She is cheerful and energetic this morning. Mother Teresa seems to be gradually stabilising. Today she appears stronger," the doctors said in an update on her condition.

"Doctors are very satisfied with her progress."

Mother Teresa has been reluctant to undergo "mechanical" cardioversion, involving a weak electric shock, her doctors said.

She was given a controlled shock in August when she was last in hospital with an irregular heartbeat.

Dr Tarun Praharaj said doctors would first try to regulate Mother Teresa's heartbeat with drugs. "We will go first for pharmacological cardioversion," he said. If that failed, they would consider administering a mild shock.

The 1979 Nobel peace prize winner underwent surgery on November 29 to clear two blocked coronary arteries, her third such operation in five years.

Then longstanding kidney and lung problems, coupled with her irregular heartbeat, complicated her recovery.

In the last few days Mother Teresa has gained strength and frequently urged doctors to let her resume her work with the sick and dying that won her the title "Saint of the Gutters".

"I will go home tomorrow," one clinic official quoted her as telling him on Saturday. "She's absolutely alert," he added.

But there was no likelihood of her leaving the clinic for some time yet, he added.

Doctors would have to monitor Mother Teresa closely for at least 48 hours after the cardioversion procedure, Praharaj said. She could then go safely home.

He warned that Mother Teresa's recovery would be slow, and that she might never be as active as before.
