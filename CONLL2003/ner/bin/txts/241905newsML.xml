<p>Doctors treating Mother Teresa said they would try to correct the 86-year old nun's irregular heartbeat on Saturday with drugs or mild electric shock.</p>
<p>A panel of doctors treating the ailing Roman Catholic missionary at Calcutta's B.M. Birla Medical Research Centre said in a regular medical bulletin that they would carry out cardioversion to try to stabilise her heartbeat.</p>
<p>Doctors had delayed the procedure while Mother Teresa recovered from life-saving heart surgery last week. But she has gained strength in recent days.</p>
<p>&quot;She is cheerful and energetic this morning. Mother Teresa seems to be gradually stabilising. Today she appears stronger,&quot; the doctors said in an update on her condition.</p>
<p>&quot;Doctors are very satisfied with her progress.&quot;</p>
<p>Mother Teresa has been reluctant to undergo &quot;mechanical&quot; cardioversion, involving a weak electric shock, her doctors said.</p>
<p>She was given a controlled shock in August when she was last in hospital with an irregular heartbeat.</p>
<p>Dr Tarun Praharaj said doctors would first try to regulate Mother Teresa's heartbeat with drugs. &quot;We will go first for pharmacological cardioversion,&quot; he said. If that failed, they would consider administering a mild shock.</p>
<p>The 1979 Nobel peace prize winner underwent surgery on November 29 to clear two blocked coronary arteries, her third such operation in five years.</p>
<p>Then longstanding kidney and lung problems, coupled with her irregular heartbeat, complicated her recovery.</p>
<p>In the last few days Mother Teresa has gained strength and frequently urged doctors to let her resume her work with the sick and dying that won her the title &quot;Saint of the Gutters&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I will go home tomorrow,&quot; one clinic official quoted her as telling him on Saturday. &quot;She's absolutely alert,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But there was no likelihood of her leaving the clinic for some time yet, he added.</p>
<p>Doctors would have to monitor Mother Teresa closely for at least 48 hours after the cardioversion procedure, Praharaj said. She could then go safely home.</p>
<p>He warned that Mother Teresa's recovery would be slow, and that she might never be as active as before.</p>
