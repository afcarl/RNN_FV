<p>			 TOP STORIES</p>
<p>The Hindustan Times</p>
<p>LOWER HOUSE ADJOURNED OVER BABRI MOSQUE ISSUE</p>
<p>The Lok Sabha (Lower House) was adjourned amid uproar over a demand that it condemn the demolition of the Babri Mosque four years ago. When the house met after lunch, shouting continued, with some of the United Front and Moslem League members storming into the well of the house to describe December 6 as a black day. Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party members were also shouted that no discussion should be allowed on the subject. Meanwhile, Ayodhya, where the Babri Mosque was demolished by the rightist cadres in 1992, remained peaceful.</p>

<p>WOMEN'S BILL PUTS MALE PARLIAMENTARIANS ON DEFENSIVE</p>
<p>The proposed Women's Bill seeking one third reservation for women in legislatures at central and state levels has alarmed some male MPs. After the bill was tabled in parliament, several male MPs across party lines threatened to vote against the proposed legislation. The Bill is being consideration of a House Select Committee. MPs opposing the Bill included many belonging to the ruling Janata Dal. Several others said they would stall the Bill if it failed to provide for reservation for women belonging to the backward castes. But all parties officially supported the Bill even as most male MPs, much to the chagrin of their female counterparts, privately opposed the Bill.</p>

<p>CENTRAL BANK TO SANCTION ECBS UNDER $3-MLN SCHEME</p>
<p>The finance ministry has decided to delegate the power to sanction the external commercial borrowings (ECB) under the U.S. $3 million scheme to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The scheme, introduced in June 1996, allows corporates to raise ECBs up to US $3 million equivalent, at a minimum maturity of three years. At present, borrowers under the scheme first get an okay from the finance ministry and then approach the RBI for clearance under Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. Sources said the new arrangement would help avoid the dual approval and would benefit corporates and institutions.</p>
<p>BAT JOINT VENTURE MAY SMOKE OUT CLASSIC</p>
<p>The proposed 50-50 joint venture between BAT Industries and its Indian associate ITC Ltd to market the former's premium cigarette brands is being perceived as a threat to ITC's home-grown premium brands. Senior ITC executives have been talking to both the Foreign Investment Promotion Board and the industry ministry to seek their help in asking BAT to launch these brands through ITC itself and not through a separate joint venture. Sources said ITC was concerned that launching of BAT brands through a separate entity would affect the company's bottomline, especially the market share of Classic, the largest selling premium brand in India.</p>
<p>EUROPEAN UNION TO SET UP INDIA EXPERTS GROUP</p>
<p>The European Union's (EU) council of ministers has stressed the importance of developing EU relations with India. To this end, it has agreed to set up an internal India Experts Group, similar to the groups on China and Japan. The council also aimed to achieve the objectives of the 1994 EU-India cooperation pact by setting up additional working groups of EU and Indian officials. Their task will be to help the Indo-EU Joint Commission promote trade and investment, particularly for the benefit of small and medium enterprises; promote liberalisation in transport and telecommunications; and develop cooperation in energy and agriculture. The ministerial council of EU has decided on these measu</p>
<p>GUIDELINES FOR JOINT VENTURES RELAXED</p>
<p>The central bank (RBI) has further relaxed norms for setting up of joint ventures, wholly-owned subsidiaries by Indian parties abroad. These include extension of benefit of the fast-track route under the scheme to Indian corporates having foreign exchange earnings from sources other than exports. The RBI has prescribed additional norms for overseas direct investment in the financial sector. The companies must have a good track record for a minimum of three years; be registered with the bourse regulator as category I merchant banker or with the RBI as a non-banking finance company; have a minimum net worth of 150 million rupees and fulfil the eight percent capital adequacy ratio.</p>

<p>TIER II CAPITAL GUIDELINES TIGHTENED</p>
<p>The central bank (RBI) has devised uniform discounting norms for calculating all scheduled commercial banks' capital adequacy ratios on account of subordinated debt instruments which form a part of tier II capital. The RBI has directed the banks to discount by 100 percent the quantum of subordinated debts in case of the remaining maturity period being less than a year. Initially, the RBI had told the banks that subordinated debt instruments should be subjected to progressive discount for inclusion in the tier two capital as they approach maturity.</p>
<p>BHARTI TELECOM TO GO AHEAD WITH $150 MLN ADR ISSUE</p>
<p>The withdrawal of by BPL Cellular Holdings (BPLCH) of its American Depository Receipt (ADR) issue will not have any bearing on the proposed ADR issue of Bharti Telecom Ltd (BTL). BTL plans to go ahead with its $150-million issue, as planned. While announcing the formation of a joint venture between BTL and U.S.-based Duraline Corp, BTL chairman Sunil Mittal said BPLCH's calling off its ADR issue was bad news, but added it would not affect BTL's plans of getting listed on the Nasdaq.  </p>

<p>SIEMENS HIVING OFF TELECOM BUSINESS</p>
<p>Siemens India Ltd's (SIL) telecommunication business is being hived off to a new company, likely to be christened Siemens Telematics. Siemens AG will hold a 70 percent stake in the new company, with SIL holding the rest. The equity capital of the new company may be over five billion rupees, in anticipation of a turnover of some $1.5 billion from company operations. The new company will have three divisions -- basic services, cellular services and transmission products. Siemens Telecom, a joint venture between Siemens AG and Bharati Telecom will continue to be a separate company.</p>
<p>BINDING OFFER ON TELECOM AT 25 PCT FOREIGN STAKE TO BE CAPPED</p>
<p>India is unlikely to improve its offer on opening up telecommunication services at the forthcoming World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial meeting at Singapore. Official sources said there was no change in the country's decision to make a binding commitment on 25 percent foreign ownership under the WTO regime. They scotched rumours that India's offer would include any timeframe for phasing out Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd's monopoly licence.</p>
<p>NEW FERTILISER POLICY SOON</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Chaturanan Mishra said the government would soon announce a new fertiliser policy. He said the government would review the entire fertiliser policy before preparing a new one. A high-powered committee would be constituted to go into various aspects of the fertiliser industry, including reasons for the fall in agricultural output and imbalances in the use of fertilisers, the minister added.</p>

<p>GERMANS UPBEAT ON MACHINE TOOL SECTOR</p>
<p>The Indian machine tool industry, which faced recession in the early 1990s, has tremendous growth prospect in the coming years, thanks to economic liberalisation, German experts say. Potential growth in the industry was over 60 percent, they added. The automobile sector's growth potential was very promising and could lift the production in the related sectors, said the German experts who were in India recently. The Indian machine tool industry is likely to move up in the global market, according to Helmut Moneshan, the Managing Director of German Machine Tool Association. In the last two years, India has moved up from 20th to 14th rank among the machine tool producing countries.</p>
<p>FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SET TERMS FOR TELECOM PROJECTS</p>
<p>Financial institutions (FIs) have urged promoters of cellular telecommunication projects, including the Birlas and the Tatas, not to finance their projects unless the sponsors agreed to hear the cash losses beyond the base case projections. The FIs have also told the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) that in the event of DoT changing an operator, the institutional lenders should be allowed to select a new operator after calling for bids and completing the process of due diligence. DoT holds the right to cancel the licence and change any operator. The FIs have told DoT if a licence was cancelled and the Department took over the licence, then DoT must make a termination payment to the</p>
<p>BELGIUM KEEN ON INFRASTRUCTURE</p>
<p>Belgian conglomerates are keen to invest in India, especially in ports and engineering products, chemicals, rubber-based products and electronics. Belgium exports goods worth 75 billion rupees to lndia and imports around 4O billion rupees worth of goods. Eighty percent of this trade is confined to India importing uncut diamonds. Diamonds apart, Belgium exports to India specialised machinery, organic and inorganic chemicals and aircraft among others. India exports textiles, jute, garments, leather goods and shrimps. The 250 MW thermal power station near Bellary in Karnataka is a joint venture of the Jindals and the Belgian company, Tractible.</p>

<p>$50 MLN THRSUTER DEAL MAY BE SIGNED WITH UK FIRM</p>
<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is likely to award a $50-million contract for the supply of 20 thrusters to the U.K.-based Chromolloy Inc. The thrusters are needed for ISRO's Insat-2E programme. The launch of Insat-2E is scheduled in 1997/1998. The US-based Marcot Kaiser and Chromolloy are the two firms shortlisted by ISRO for this deal. But indications are that the contract may be clinched by the UK firm, with the advantage of its longer association with ISRO projects.</p>
