ISLAMABAD 1996-12-07

A three-year-old boy was killed and six members of his family were wounded when a bomb wrecked their home in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar early on Saturday, the official news agency APP said.

It said the bomb was planted beside the wall of a butcher's house in the city's Charssada district.

The house collapsed on its sleeping occupants, who were later pulled from the debris by neighbours. The blast damaged 14 shops in the market area and broke windows of nearby houses.

APP said a man known to have a personal enmity with the butcher had been arrested.
