Pakistan troops raid heroin labs on Afghan border.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan 1996-12-07

Pakistani troops backed by armoured personnel carriers raided three heroin laboratories in a remote tribal area bordering Afghanistan on Saturday, an official said.

"It was a big, successful operation with the element of surprise," Sherzada Khan, the Political Agent for the Khyber Agency in northwestern Pakistan, told Reuters.

He said about 1,000 paramilitary troops of the Khyber Rifles militia had taken part in the raid, launched at 2 a.m. (2100 GMT Friday), in the Toda Mela area, 37 km (23 miles) southwest of the city of Peshawar.

He added that the troops had recovered 25 kg (55 pounds) of refined heroin from one laboratory and 73 kg (161 pounds) from another. They had also seized a total of 1.8 tonnes of heroin that was being processed at the three laboratories, in addition to undisclosed quantities of opium, chemicals and weapons.

"There was no resistance because we had already done the political work of persuading the tribal elders," Khan said.

The local telephone exchange was cut off during the raid. Four men were arrested and 40 shops were destroyed by bulldozers for alleged trading in narcotics.

"Future operations will penetrate even deeper into the remote tribal border areas," Khan said.

The laboratories were among a total of 12, some owned by Afghan refugees, believed to be located in the Khyber Agency.

It was the third major operation since 1994 conducted against heroin processing plants in the tribal areas, which are not fully under the control of the Pakistani government.

Pakistan has been under pressure from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to crack down on heroin laboratories.
