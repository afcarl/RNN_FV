<p>Pakistani troops backed by armoured personnel carriers raided three heroin laboratories in a remote tribal area bordering Afghanistan on Saturday, an official said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a big, successful operation with the element of surprise,&quot; Sherzada Khan, the Political Agent for the Khyber Agency in northwestern Pakistan, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said about 1,000 paramilitary troops of the Khyber Rifles militia had taken part in the raid, launched at 2 a.m. (2100 GMT Friday), in the Toda Mela area, 37 km (23 miles) southwest of the city of Peshawar.</p>
<p>He added that the troops had recovered 25 kg (55 pounds) of refined heroin from one laboratory and 73 kg (161 pounds) from another. They had also seized a total of 1.8 tonnes of heroin that was being processed at the three laboratories, in addition to undisclosed quantities of opium, chemicals and weapons.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no resistance because we had already done the political work of persuading the tribal elders,&quot; Khan said.</p>
<p>The local telephone exchange was cut off during the raid. Four men were arrested and 40 shops were destroyed by bulldozers for alleged trading in narcotics.</p>
<p>&quot;Future operations will penetrate even deeper into the remote tribal border areas,&quot; Khan said.</p>
<p>The laboratories were among a total of 12, some owned by Afghan refugees, believed to be located in the Khyber Agency.</p>
<p>It was the third major operation since 1994 conducted against heroin processing plants in the tribal areas, which are not fully under the control of the Pakistani government.</p>
<p>Pakistan has been under pressure from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to crack down on heroin laboratories.</p>
