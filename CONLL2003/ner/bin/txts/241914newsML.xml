<p>The Afghan Taleban militia forced a U.N. plane carrying a Tajik Islamic rebel leader to land at an airbase in western Afghanistan on Saturday, Taleban and U.N. sources said.</p>
<p>The Taleban governor of Herat, Mullah Yar Mohammad, told Reuters by telephone that Taleban fighter jets had forced an unidentified plane to land at Shindand military airbase.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still trying to verify whether it is a U.N. plane,&quot; he said. &quot;We forced it down because we didn't know its identity. We were not asked permission for it to use our airspace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If it is clarified that it is a U.N. plane we will respect the crew and passengers and we will let it go,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>U.N. sources confirmed that the plane was a U.N. flight from Mashhad in Iran to the northern Afghan city of Kunduz.</p>
<p>Iranian radio said the U.N. plane had been carrying Tajik Islamic opposition leader Sayed Abdullo Nuri.</p>
<p>&quot;The radio is well informed,&quot; said a U.N. source, who asked not to be named, when asked about the report.</p>
<p>&quot;According to reports reaching us from Herat, a U.N. aeroplane, which was flying from Mashhad to Taloqan in the north of Afghanistan, was confronted by Taleban warplanes in Herat's airspace on Saturday morning and forced to land,&quot; Iranian radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, said.</p>
<p>&quot;The plane, which is now at Shindand airport, was carrying eight Tajik passengers. Abdullo Nuri, the Tajik opposition leader, is among the passengers,&quot; the radio added.</p>
<p>The radio quoted the Taleban as saying the plane had also been carrying some Iranians, but a U.N. source denied this.</p>
<p>&quot;U.N. efforts to have the plane fly again have so far been unsuccessful and there has been no information about the passengers' fate,&quot; it said in a Pashto-language broadcast.</p>
<p>Diplomats in Herat said the plane was expected to be released soon, but could not take off at night. They said it might leave Shindand on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Sources in Pakistan said the plane had apparently been chartered by the United Nations in Dushanbe as part of U.N. efforts to mediate between the Islamic opposition guerrillas and the Russian-backed government of President Imamali Rakhmonov.</p>
<p>Earlier in Moscow, Russia's Interfax news agency reported Rakhmonov saying he planned to meet Nuri early next week despite the latest flare-up in fighting in the former Soviet republic.</p>
<p>The Tajik government says the Islamic guerrillas operate from northern Afghanistan. The Taleban have criticised Tajikistan in the past for alleged meddling in Afghan affairs.</p>
