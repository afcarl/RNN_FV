Indonesia can produce 18,000 MW from geo-thermal.

Indonesia's Mines and Energy Minister Ida Bagus Sudjana said on Saturday that the country had the potential to produce 18,000 megawatts of power from geo-thermal energy.

In an interview with Reuters at an international energy conference in this tourist resort state, Sudjana said installed geo-thermal power generation capacity in Indonesia was currently 300 megawatts.

But he said Indonesia planned to raise geo-thermal generation capacity to 1,000 megawatts by March 1998 - the end of the current five-year economic plan.

He also said Indonesia had identified areas which could produce a combined 18,000 megawatts in geo-thermal power.

Indonesia, Asia's only member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), is trying to diversify away from reliance on crude oil for its energy needs.

Galloping energy demand of about seven percent per year means it could turn into a net crude oil importer around 2005. Indonesia currently produces around 1.5 million barrels of crude and condensates per day, Sudjana said.

Sudjana said Indonesia was working to exploit other forms of energy to preserve its crude oil reserves -- such as geo-thermal energy, gas and hydro power.
