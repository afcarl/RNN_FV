Indonesia to develop two giant gas finds at same time.

Indonesia has decided to develop the Natuna and Irian Jaya giant gas finds simultaneously because of strong demand for gas in the region, Mines and Energy Minister Ida Bagus Sudjana said on Saturday.

In an interview with Reuter at an oil producer-consumer conference, Sudjana said "we have decided that both gas in Natuna and Irian Jaya will be developed simultaneously because of the increased demand from countries."

He cited Japan, South Korea, India and Thailand as showing interest in the gas finds.

Indonesian newspaper reports in November said the $40 billion Natuna project in the South China Sea was being put on ice because of the discovery of gas in Irian Jaya province by U.S. oil company Atlantic Richfield Co (ARCO).

Reserves at the offshore Natuna field are estimated at 210 trillion cubic feet (tcf), of which 45 tcf are recoverable.

Indonesia's state-owned oil company Pertamina, the world's largest producer of liquefied natural gas, said the Natuna project would have 16 platforms and produce 2.4 billion cubic feet of gas a day.

U.S. oil giant Exxon Corp has a 50-percent stake in the field, Mobil Corp a 26 percent stake and Pertamina 24 percent. Pertamina has been holding discussions with Japanese firms on divesting moe of its holdings.

ARCO reported on June 18 that its Wiriager Deep-3 appraisal well tested a cumulative 43 million cubic feet per day. Estimated reserves have not been released yet.

Wiriager Deep-3 was the fourth well in an appraisal programme on the Berau Block of Bituni Bay on the western half of New Guinea island.

Nippon Exploration (Berau) Ltd, a Nippon Oil Co Ltd subsidiary, has a 17.4 percent stake in the Berau block, while KP Berau, an affiliate of Kanematsu Petroleum Corp, also holds 22.9 percent.

Analysts said Natuna could prove more costly to develop because it was in deeper water, while the Irian Jaya find was in relatively shallow water.

In addition, 72 percent of the gas at Natuna is carbon dioxide (CO2), which would require a high level of investment in CO2 separation plants.

Sudjana said Indonesia remained fully committed to the Natuna field and its development schedule had not been altered because of the Irian Jaya find.

The field is expected to be on stream around 2002.
