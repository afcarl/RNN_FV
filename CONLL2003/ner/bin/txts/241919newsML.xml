<headline>Iran to award first oil projects in a few months.</headline>

<p>Iran is on track to award in the next couple of months two of ten oil and gas projects opened to bids from international firms, Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Most of the remainder of the offshore developments, put to tender in August 1995, should be awarded by the middle of next year, Aghazadeh told reporters at an international energy conference in this tourist resort state.</p>
<p>&quot;In a maximum two months we will finalise some projects,&quot; Aghazadeh said. &quot;I hope that most of the projects we will be able to finalise during the next six months.&quot;</p>
<p>Aghazadeh said redevelopment of the 60,000 barrel a day (bpd) Soroush field in the Middle East Gulf near Kharg Island, damaged in the Iran-Iraq war, and the 35,000 bpd Balal oilfield near Lavan would be the first to be awarded.</p>
<p>The Iranian minister said the ten projects would require investment totalling US$4 billion to $5 billion.</p>
<p>Iran's open-door oil policy was launched with the signing in 1995 of a $600 million deal with France's Total SA to develop ther Sirri A and E oil and gas fields.</p>
<p>The United States has tried to deny finances to Tehran by passing legislation aimed at punishing non-U.S. firms which invest more than $40 million in Iran.</p>
<p>Aghazadeh said he hoped a reduction in state subsidies on petroleum product sales would cut domestic Iranian oil consumption again this year.</p>
<p>He said oil consumption in Iran dropped 100,000 bpd in the financial year 1995-1996 to about one million bpd.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to decrease consumption because we raise prices every year. At the end of this winter we will see what the effect was on local consumption.&quot;</p>
<p>Aghazadeh reaffirmed that Iran's oil production capacity remained at a sustainable four million bpd plus another 200,000 bpd of surge capacity.</p>
<p>Plans to push capacity to 4.5 million bpd over the next three years were on course with another 200,000 bpd of offshore capacity scheduled for next year, he said.</p>
<p>The minister said he still hoped OPEC could come up with a better method of monitoring member country output to keep tabs on production above official quotas. But he said had no hard plans of his own.</p>
<p>He said the issue would be revisited again by OPEC's four man quota compliance committee at a regular meeting in March or April ahead of OPEC's next full conference in June.</p>
