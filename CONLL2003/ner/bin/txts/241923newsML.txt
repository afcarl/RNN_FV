The widow of Benazir Bhutto's slain brother Murtaza said on Saturday she was considering running against her sister-in-law in a general election set for February 3.

"It's a possibility," Lebanese-born Ghinwa Bhutto, 34, told a news conference in Islamabad. "If I contest against her of course I will hope to win against her."

Ghinwa last month accepted the leadership of her late husband's breakaway faction of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), opposed to the mainstream party led by Bhutto.

Bhutto herself was expected soon to visit Larkana, her home constituency, for the first time since her dismissal as prime minister by President Farooq Leghari on November 5.

The PPP said in a statement that Bhutto's jailed husband Asif Ali Zardari had decided not to contest the elections. Zardari, elected to the National Assembly from Sindh province in 1993, was investment minister in his wife's ousted government.

Ghinwa, speaking in English, said a rapprochement with Bhutto was unlikely because of her response to the killing of Murtaza Bhutto in a clash with Karachi police on September 20.

"There was a possibility at the beginning. I had come to her with an open heart, asking her to start a new page," said the slender, black-clad figure, surrounded by security men.

"But the way she handled the case and she defended the police officers who were directly involved in the murder and the way she attacked me instead of sheltering me and my family, she was denying our right to the heritage of the Bhuttos. All this pushed away any possibility of rapprochement."

Asked why she was so heavily guarded, Ghinwa said: "I fear the murderers of my husband."

She accused Bhutto of denying her and her children access to Nusrat Bhutto, Iranian-born mother of Benazir and Murtaza.

"I miss her (Nusrat) very much and my children miss her too. She is like a mother to us and we haven't been able to get in touch with her. We have tried, we have called so many times, but they never put her through. I feel she has been used by Benazir against me and I feel very bad about it," she said.

Ghinwa has one son, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, by Murtaza and is also looking after Fatima, Murtaza's daughter by his first wife.

She dismissed Bhutto's accusation that Leghari had been directly responsible for her husband's murder.

"If she really believed that President Leghari was involved in the murder, she should have done something about it when she was chief executive in the government," she said.

Ghinwa said she was not accusing or exonerating anyone of the killing until inquiries were complete, but blamed Bhutto for feuding with Murtaza, instead of seeking a reconciliation.

"I never wanted to be a part of this feud," she said. "I always wanted to be the link that should not be cut between the two...So we always had a very courteous relationship."

Ghinwa, a newcomer to politics who speaks little Urdu, said she was open to talks with other parties ahead of the elections.

She said her PPP faction would publish its manifesto in Lahore on December 14. "The most important points will be abolition of corruption, emphasis on education and improving the representation of women in parliament," she added.

Ghinwa was due to meet caretaker Prime Minister Meraj Khalid later on Saturday for what she described as a courtesy call.
