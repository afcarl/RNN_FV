Oman said on Saturday that its ambitious plans to build a $10 billion, underwater gas pipeline to India will remain on hold until the technology involved becomes economically viable.

"The project unfortunately turned out to be economically unfeasible," Salem Bin Mohammed Bin Shahban, under secretary in the ministry of petroleum and mineral resources, told reporters while attending oil producer-consumer talks in this resort area.

He said the technology that would have been required for the deep sea, 1,300 km line left too many uncertainties concerning costs so the project had been abandoned.

"It was a very ambitious project. We think it...could have been one of the most important projects in the region, not from a capital investment point of view but from a technological point of view."

He said the project could only become feasible again when costs come down.

India has been keen to boost gas use to reduce its reliance on oil supplies.
