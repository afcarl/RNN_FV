Pakistani cotton rates close steady, seen stable.

KARACHI, Pakistan 1996-12-07

Pakistani cotton rates closed steady on Saturday in thin trade, brokers said.

Trading was dull due to a liquidity crunch and most spinners who bought cotton for their immediate needs had gone to the sidelines, broker Oveis Razzak said.

In the kerb market, the rates for NIAB-78 ranged from 2,350 to 2,375 rupees per maund (37.32 kg), he said. Little change was expected on Sunday.
