GOA, India 1996-12-07

Iran called on Asian oil importers on Saturday to dismantle trade barriers to help meet booming energy demand.

Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh, addressing an international energy conference, also warned against politically-motivated energy projects and criticised oil derivatives trade.

"Asia should strive to eliminate trade barriers with the Persian Gulf in the energy and other sectors," Aghazadeh said.

India, hosting the producer-consumer gathering, has one of the region's biggest energy bills and some of the heaviest import tariffs.

"Countries such as Japan, China, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, India, Pakistan, Thailand should note that they may enjoy security of supply of the Persian Gulf if they provide us with security of demand," the Iranian minister said.

"Only our (Middle East) reserves are sufficent for their increasing energy needs."

Asian energy companies should also avoid "politically oriented" projects by "creating equal conditions for all producers of oil and gas to develop their resources irrespective of political factors, he said.

Tehran is battling to attract international investment in its upstream oil and gas sector in the face of a U.S. trade ban and legislation aimed at punishing non-U.S. companies which invest in Iranian projects.

Malaysian oil company Petronas has come under criticism from Washington for signing an agreement with state National Iranian Oil Corp for an oilfield development.

Aghazadeh also said "misled hedging and other financial instruments" had proved harmful to oil producers in recent years.

"No-one disputes the role of markets, provided they are truly free," he said.
