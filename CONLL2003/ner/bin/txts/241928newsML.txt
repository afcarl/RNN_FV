Six killed in clash in Kashmir forest.

SRINAGAR, India 1996-12-07

Two Indian soldiers and four separatist guerrillas were killed in a seven-hour gun battle in a forest in Kashmir, a defence spokesman said on Saturday.

Six soldiers were wounded in the clash late on Friday after security forces raided a guerrilla hideout in the thick forests of Khaipora, 25 km (15 miles) southwest of the state's summer capital Srinagar, P. Purshuttam said.

He said an army officer, a soldier and four foreign militants belonging to the Lashkar-e-Tioba group were killed.

Lashkar-e-Tioba is one of more than a dozen groups fighting Indian rule over Jammu and Kashmir state. Authorities say Lashkar-e-Tioba is comprised largely of Afghans.

India says Pakistan trains and arms mercenaries and Kashmiri militants. Islamabad says it offers only political and diplomatic support to the separatists.

More than 20,000 people have been killed in since the separatist revolt erupted nearly seven years ago in mostly Hindu India's only Moslem majority state.
