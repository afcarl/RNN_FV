<p>Two Indian soldiers and four separatist guerrillas were killed in a seven-hour gun battle in a forest in Kashmir, a defence spokesman said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Six soldiers were wounded in the clash late on Friday after security forces raided a guerrilla hideout in the thick forests of Khaipora, 25 km (15 miles) southwest of the state's summer capital Srinagar, P. Purshuttam said.</p>
<p>He said an army officer, a soldier and four foreign militants belonging to the Lashkar-e-Tioba group were killed.</p>
<p>Lashkar-e-Tioba is one of more than a dozen groups fighting Indian rule over Jammu and Kashmir state. Authorities say Lashkar-e-Tioba is comprised largely of Afghans.</p>
<p>India says Pakistan trains and arms mercenaries and Kashmiri militants. Islamabad says it offers only political and diplomatic support to the separatists.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people have been killed in since the separatist revolt erupted nearly seven years ago in mostly Hindu India's only Moslem majority state.</p>
