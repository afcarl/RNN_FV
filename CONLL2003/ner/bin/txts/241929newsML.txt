Saudis say world oil supply more secure than ever.

Oil consumers should not worry about security of supply, despite crude prices now running near six-year highs, the world's biggest oil producer and exporter, Saudi Arabia, said on Saturday.

"Today, oil supply is more secure than ever. The reserve base is almost double what it was two decades ago. So is the number of producers," Deputy Minister of Petroleum Affairs Abdulaziz Bin Salman Al Saud told a meeting of consuming and producing countries in this resort region.

"As a major producer of oil who considers the long lifetime of its reserves, we attach great importance to stable markets and growing demand," he said.

He told producers and consumers, meeting for a fifth time since the 1990-1991 Gulf War oil price scare, to consign to the bin the old notions of oil supply security and oil market regulation.

A transparent supply chain and transparent oil markets, had replaced the OPEC-administered system of fixed crude prices in place during the oil shocks of the 1970s, he said.

Energy producing and consuming governments should concentrate on making sure trade barriers did not block the huge investment necessary for projects to meet growing oil and gas demand, he said.

He said developing nations should not have to curtail energy demand to meet the growing environmental demands of established industrial nations.

"Developing countries should not bear the excesses of the old polluting industrial order by curtailing their growth potential and energy demand," he said.
