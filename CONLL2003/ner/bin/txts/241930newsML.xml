<title>INDIA: India woman leader arrested on corruption charge.</title>

<p>India's most visible woman politician, Jayaram Jayalalitha, was arrested in a corruption case on Saturday, seven months after she was toppled from power in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>Police said Jayalalitha, a former movie idol, was charged with ordering some 85 million rupees' ($2.4 million) worth of excess spending on television sets for villagers while she was Tamil Nadu chief minister. She denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Since her All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) party was trounced in state elections in May, Jayalalitha, 48, has been charged in seven corruption cases ranging from foreign exchange to income tax violations.</p>
<p>Talking to reporters at the state police chief's office after her arrest in the state capital Madras, Jayalalitha said: &quot;This is nothing but political victimisation.&quot;</p>
<p>State judge A. Ramamurthy remanded the former movie star to judicial custody until December 21.</p>
<p>Jayalalitha quit films in 1982 after a successful acting career to become one of India's most powerful regional politicians.</p>
<p>She took over the AIADMK, a party representing low-caste Hindus and Tamil speakers, from her former co-star, matinee idol M.G. Ramachandran, after his death in 1997.</p>
<p>As chief minister, she built up a personality cult, erecting huge plyboard cutouts of herself around Madras and proclaiming her development successes on giant hoardings during elections.</p>
<p>But disillusionment set in with what many Tamils saw as her extravagant lifestyle and increasingly autocratic manner.</p>
<p>More than half of the 27 members of her former cabinet face criminal or corruption cases.</p>
<p>Jayalalitha and Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, who also comes from Tamil Nadu, have been engaged in a running political battle since 1993.</p>
