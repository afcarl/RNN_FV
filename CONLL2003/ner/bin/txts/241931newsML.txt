Venezuela proposes body to track world energy needs.

GOA, India 1996-12-07

Venezuelan Oil Minister Erwin Arrieta proposed to oil consuming and producing nations meeting in India on Saturday that a international body be set up to look at world energy needs, laws, taxes and environmental issues.

"I would like to propose the formation of a multilateral committee, hand in hand with the creation of a fund that would receive contributions to finance the required studies," Arrieta told the "Fifth International Energy Conference" meeting in the south Indian state of Goa.

He said a global research and development study group could help guide investment in the energy sector in order to keep abreast of consumption needs in the expanding world economy.

Arrieta also said this body could explore the possibility of founding a multilateral energy organisation like the World Bank or the International Finance Corporation to vet and fund energy projects.

On Friday, Norway's new oil minister Grete Foremo suggested energy was such a vital commodity that an international forum should be set up along the lines of other grouping such as the World Trade Organisation.

OPEC Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman said on Saturday that the oil producer group would not oppose discussions on forming a global oup.

However, he said he expected it to be some time before producers and consumers came to any sort of agreement on a global policy group.

"You have to develop the confidence to erect the right type of bridges between the various elements involved before you come to a point of making a recommendation," he said.

"We (producers and consumers) are going to talk about it first because people are nervous."

Previous producer-consumer meetings, instituted after the Gulf War oil scare, have done little to narrow the philosophical rift between buyers and sellers, though all have paid lip service to cooperation and agree that stable prices and supplies are a must.

Arrieta said the world needed a central organisation to forecast energy demand and plot the type of energy supply required.

It should also address the legal, policy and taxation implications and devise mechanisms to encourage massive participation of private companies in energy projects.

Risks to the environment should also be evaluated by the study group, the Venezuelan minister said.
