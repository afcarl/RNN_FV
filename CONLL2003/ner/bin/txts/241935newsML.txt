Sri Lanka deputy defence minister safe - official.

COLOMBO 1996-12-07

A military helicopter carrying Sri Lanka's deputy defence minister and army chief crash-landed in the country's north on Saturday, but both men are safe, a military official said.

The helicopter, with minister Anuruddha Ratwatte and army commander Lieutenant-General Rohan Daluwatte, came down in rebel-held territory north of the town of Vavuniya, about 220 km (135 miles) from the capital Colombo.  

"It had crash-landed after experiencing mechanical trouble," the official told Reuters.

A senior air force official said the men had been brought to Vavuniya and were safe. "They are all fine," he said.

Ratwatte and Daluwatte are widely credited with the military's recent victories over separatist Tamil Tiger guerrillas in the north of this Indian Ocean island nation.

The Sri Lankan government has been embroiled in an ethnic war since 1983 against Tamil Tiger rebels demanding a separate homeland in the north and east of the predominantly Sinhalese nation.
