Pakistani vegetable oil stocks rose in the week to Friday on higher imports and dealers said on Saturday stocks were likely to remain steady on balanced supply and demand.

"Edible oil stocks rose (approximately) to 109,000 tonnes on Friday from 95,000 tonnes on November 29," one dealer of Saulat Enterprises said.

"The stocks rose due to higher imports," he said.

Edible oil prices eased slightly in the local market in the week to Friday due to higher availability of imports and traders see a slight fall in prices in coming days, the dealer said.

The 109,000 tonnes of stocks included 90,000 tonnes of RBD palm and olein, 18,000 tonnes soyoil and sunflower oil and 1,000 tonnes palm and olein with the state-run Ghee Corp of Pakistan (GCP), the dealer said.

He said about 19,000 tonnes palm oil, which had been booked for the GCP, was likely to reach Pakistan by the end of this month.

The dealer said two ships, Vanino carrying 3,600 tonnes of tallow and Wawasan Murni carrying 27,000 tonnes of palm oil were expected to reach Karachi in the next few days. Some ships were being loaded with vegoils at Malaysia and South America.  

Indicative prices in the local market for RBD palm oil fell to $542.50 per tonne C&F from $545 last week and soyoil to $547.50 from $550, the dealer said.

In Pakistani rupees, the rate for palm oil at Keamari port rose to 1,237 per maund (37.32 kg) from 1,230 and soyoil to 1,245 from 1,240, the dealer said.

One dealer of Jaleel Brothers Ltd said edible oil prices had shown a slight upward trend in the week ended Thursday.

The dealer said RBD palm oil was traded at 1,235 rupees per maund compared to 1,230 at Karachi port and soyoil at 1,270 compared to 1,240.
