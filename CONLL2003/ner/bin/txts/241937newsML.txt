Sri Lankan loses contact with military helicopter.

COLOMBO 1996-12-07

Sri Lankan military authorities lost contact with an air force helicopter carrying Sri Lankan Deputy Defence Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte and army commander Lieutenant-General Rohan Daluwatte on Saturday, a military official said.

But he said it was too early to declare the helicopter officially missing.  

"We understand the aircraft had lost contact with ground," the official told Reuters.

No further details were immediately available. Other military officials would only say "something" had happened.

Ratwatte and Daluwatte are widely credited with the military's recent victories over separatist Tamil Tiger guerrillas in the north of this Indian Ocean island nation.

The Sri Lankan government has been embroiled in an ethnic war since 1983 against Tamil rebels demanding a separate homeland in the north and east of this predominantly Sinhalese nation.
