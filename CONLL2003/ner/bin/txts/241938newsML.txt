OPEC would not oppose talks on world oil group.

OPEC Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman said on Saturday that the oil producer group would not oppose discussions on forming a global energy policy group.

Norway's new oil minister Grete Foremo suggested on Friday that energy was such a vital commodity that an international forum should be set up along the lines of other grouping such as the World Trade Organisation.

"We are not afraid of that," Lukman told reporters on the sidelines of oil producer-consumer talks in this Indian resort region.

However, he said he expected it to be some time before producers and consumers came to any sort of agreement on a global policy group.

"You have to develop the confidence to erect the right type of bridges between the various elements involved before you come to a point of making a recommendation," he said.

"We (producers and consumers) are going to talk about it first because people are nervous."

Previous producer-consumer meetings, instituted after the Gulf War oil scare, have done little to narrow the philosophical rift between buyers and sellers, though all have paid lip service to cooperation and agree that stable prices and supplies are a must.

However, Faremo said this meeting might be the right time to start a discussion on whether the energy dialogue could be developed further.

"There is a world food organisation, a trade organisation and a health organisation. But there isn't any global energy organisation," she said.

"And there isn't even a reminiscence of a global energy policy."

Faremo said it was a paradox that such an organisation does not exist as energy permeated the very core of political, economic and environmental interest of countries.

"But we have the opportunity to do something about it. We can use this producer-consumer dialogue to put energy on the political agenda," she said.

"I was putting in the idea for a dialogue knowing it will be a long process," she told reporters later.

Faremo told the meeting more common ground could be found between the countries with emerging economies and the industrialised West, whether producers or consumers.

She said while security of supply was vital for the consuming countries, security of demand was equally important for the producers.

"This interdependence should form the basis for enhanced cooperation," she said.
