Bangladesh taka gains on poor dollar demand.

DHAKA 1996-12-07

The Bangladesh taka recovered early losses after poor demand for the greenback helped it to a firmer close of 42.5475/4280 to the dollar in interbank trading, dealers said. This compared with 42.5480/5485 previously.

The local unit was quoted at 42.5480/5495 in early trade but gained later as importers remained almost absent due to weekend closure of international markets, dealers said. "Also outflow of foreign portfolio funds has slowed down with the slump in the stock market. So dollar demand as a whole is low," said one dealer. The interbank call money rates finished flat at 4.75 percent to 5.5 percent, dealers said.
