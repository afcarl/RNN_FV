Pakistan gets nine bids for 50,000 tonnes sugar.

KARACHI, Pakistan 1996-12-07

The state-run Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) said on Saturday it had received nine bids for the import of 50,000 tonnes of crystal white sugar by December 31.  

"The bids are being processed," a TCP official said without giving details.

The government had ordered sugar import because of the late start of sugarcane crushing in November instead of October, one dealer said.

The TCP officials have not given the import target for the remaining year of fiscal 1996/97 (July-June).

The TCP and private importers had booked more than 425,000 tonnes of sugar by October, one dealer said.
