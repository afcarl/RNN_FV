<p>A cyclone that hit India's southeastern coast on Friday killed one person but caused no major damage and was quickly weakening, meteorologists and officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The cyclone has now weakened into a low depression,&quot; J.V.M. Naidu, director of the Cyclone Warning Centre at Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh state, said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;It has a maximum wind speed of 20 kilometres per hour (12 miles per hour). We do not expect any tidal waves,&quot; he told Reuters by telephone from the port city.</p>
<p>Another meteorological official said the depression was likely to move west causing rains in the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala.</p>
<p>Police officials in Madras, capital of Tamil Nadu state, told Reuters that one person was killed in the city on Friday night when a tree fell on his car.</p>
<p>There were no other reports of casualties in Tamil Nadu or neighbouring Andhra Pradesh state.</p>
<p>Madras airport reopened on Friday night after shutting down briefly because of heavy rain.</p>
<p>&quot;It's bright sunshine now. Flights are back to normal,&quot; an airport manager said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Press Trust of India news agency, quoting Tamil Nadu's most senior civil servant K.A. Nambiar, said the cyclone ripped up trees and blew over hoardings and billboards but caused no other damage.</p>
<p>The cyclone hit Pondicherry and South Arcot district, 162 kilometres (100 miles) south of Madras on Friday evening, but there were no reports of any casualties, police officials said.</p>
<p>When the storm crossed land, winds reached 100 kph (60 mph) but quickly weakened.</p>
<p>&quot;We had moderate rain,&quot; said T.S. Ravichandran, police chief at Cuddalore, a town in the coastal South Arcot district. &quot;It's drizzling now.&quot;</p>
<p>The cyclone had earlier threatened to cross land near the port town of Machilipatnam in Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday. But it moved south and weakened by Thursday.</p>
<p>Officials in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu said there were no immediate reports on damage to crops.</p>
<p>Last month, at least 2,000 people were killed or are missing after a storm swept through the East and West Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh state.</p>
