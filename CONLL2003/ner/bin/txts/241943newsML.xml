<p>Indian health workers began vaccinating some 125 million children on Saturday in the second phase of the most ambitious chapter of a worldwide campaign to eradicate the crippling disease polio by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Organisers said some two million health workers at 500,000 centres across India were expected to take part in the immunisation programme, believed to be the most ambitious public health event in a single day in the history of any country.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda launched Saturday's campaign, administering two drops of oral polio vaccine to children on the lawn outside his official residence in the capital.</p>
<p>In remote regions of the western state of Rajasthan, volunteers planned to use camels to deliver the vaccine. In the hills of the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the medicine was to be brought by health workers on foot.</p>
<p>In December 1995 and last January, an estimated 93 million children up to three years of age were innoculated.</p>
<p>The second phase of the three-year programme was to be spread over two days, Saturday and next January 20, and cover some 125 million children up to age five. The two sessions were to be repeated a third and last time in late 1997 and early 1998.</p>
<p>The Indian effort was part of a global drive to wipe out poliomyelitis, an infectious viral disease that strikes the central nervous system and can cause temporary or permanent paralysis. It has already been eradicated in the Americas.</p>
<p>Children are especially vulnerable to the illness, which is transmitted by human excrement.</p>
<p>The disease thrives in the hot, congested conditions common in the Indian subcontinent, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p>
<p>Health Secretary J.C. Pant said 742 cases of polio had been reported in India in the first nine months of 1996, compared with 2,643 for the same period in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The results of last year's campaign are very encouraging,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Since the global eradication drive was launched in 1988, the number of reported cases has fallen by more than 80 percent, to 6,200 from 31,000.</p>
<p>But the WHO estimates that for every documented case, nine go unreported, with two thirds of them in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>The polio virus still circulates in some 70 countries.</p>
<p>Recently there have been outbreaks in Chechnya, Pakistan and Zaire, according to Rotary International, which expects to have spent $400 million on the eradication project by 2000.</p>
