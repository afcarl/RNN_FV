Nomura said planning $150 mln bond for Pakistan.

KARACHI, Pakistan 1996-12-07

Japan's Nomura will soon float a $150 million convertible five-year bond which investors will be able to convert into shares of state-run Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (PTCL), the Karachi-based daily Business Recorder said on Saturday.

Shahid Javed Burki, finance and economic affairs adviser to caretaker Prime Minister Meraj Khalid, would be discussing the issue with Nomura during his current visit to Tokyo, it said.

Burki was also likely to discuss a proposed long-term $300 million yen bond issue with Nomura, the newspaper said.

Officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the Business Recorder report.

Burki told Reuters Financial Television in Tokyo on Saturday that Pakistan hoped to issue a samurai bond in early 1997 to provide capital for development, but gave no details.

"To lend a helping hand to boost reserves and meet the debt repayments in December, Nomura reportedly has agreed in principle to bridge half of the issue it is underwriting and give $75 million to the government by December 20," Business Recorder said.  

It said that under the proposed deal, Nomura would place the paper with investors at 1.2 percent above the London Interbank Offered Rate. At present Pakistan is paying 1.5 percent above LIBOR on dollar swap funds and around 2.05 percent above LIBOR on one-year syndicated commercial loans, it added.

Business Recorder said the premium on the PTCL share value would be fixed through a put option clause. The government would also retain a call option to retire the bond earlier in case it can get a better price on PTCL. The market performance of PTCL shares over the next five years would therefore determine what option the government or bond-holders choose to exercise.

The government owns 88 percent of PTCL equity and is hoping to sell a 26 percent stake to a strategic investor who would take over management of the telecom utility.
