Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete said on Saturday that he was opposed to the outright sale of Nigeria's multibillion dollar joint venture oil assets.

"I am of the opinion that governments will continue to hold a majority share in the industry," he told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of oil consuming and producing countries in this resort region.

Nigerian finance minister Anthony Ani floated the possible sale of Nigeria's shares in six oil production joint ventures at an annual economic forum in Abuja earlier this year.

He told an IMF meeting in Washington in October that Nigeria was seriously considering the option.

But oil minister Etete said the issue was still being studied.

"Without contradicting (the finance minister) the issue is still under examination and we have not taken a final position," he said

OPEC member Nigeria, through the state petroleum corporation, owns an average 57 percent share in joint ventures with Shell, Mobil, Chevron, Texaco, Agip and Elf.

An outright sale would raise billions of dollars for Nigeria's hard-pressed economy. The West African oil producer would raise revenues from tax and royalties in the same way the oil sector operates in Britain and the United States.

Expectations in Nigeria are that the proposals for the equity sale may be raised in the annual budget in January.
