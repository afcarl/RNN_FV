<p>Iranian oil minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh said on Saturday he was looking forward to the return of Iraqi crude to world markets after a six year hiatus and said it would have no impact on crude prices.</p>
<p>&quot;They are welcome to the market,&quot; the minister said of fellow OPEC member Iraq during a break at oil producer-consumer talks in this Indian resort region.</p>
<p>Asked whether he thought the extra oil would depress world prices, which have been nearing six-year highs, the minister said: &quot;No. At this moment the market is good, the demand now is good and we are not afraid of Iraq's oil.&quot;</p>
<p>Iraq's oil minister said on Friday that he expected exports under a U.N.oil-for-food deal would begin early on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Iraq can export $2 billion worth of oil every six months to enable it to buy food for its sanctions-hit population. The deal is renewable.</p>
<p>The limited exports will be Iraq's first since a ban on Iraqi exports was imposed following its invasion of Kuwait in August, 1990.</p>
<p>The Iraqi oil minister told state television that he expected exports would not exceed 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) at current prices.</p>
<p>Oil analysts believe the return of Iraqi oil will have little immediate price impact as it coincides with the peak demand northern winter. However, some said it could depress levels in the spring, when demand drops sharply.</p>
<p>Aghazadeh also said he expected awards to be made shortly on the first of a series of international tenders for oil and gas exploration in Iranian waters in the Middle East Gulf.</p>
<p>&quot;We are working closely with the international companies and maybe in the next one or two months we will finalise a project,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>State-owned National Iranian Oil Company issued the tender to international oil firms in August 1995 for development of 10 major oil and gas projects.</p>
<p>NIOC's open-door policy was launched just prior to the tender when it signed a ground-breaking $600 million deal with French firm Total SA to develop the Sirri A and E oil and gas fields.</p>
<p>However, United States sanctions on Tehran, aimed at denying finances for what Washington alleges fund terrorism, have delayed the award of more projects.</p>
