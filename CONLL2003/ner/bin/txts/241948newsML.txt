Doctors to regulate Mother Teresa's heartbeat.

Doctors treating Mother Teresa said they would try to correct the missionary's irregular heart beat on Saturday with drugs or mild electric shock.

A panel of doctors treating the ailing Roman Catholic nun at Calcutta's B.M. Birla Medical Research Centre said in a regular medical bulletin that they would carry out "cardioversion" to try to stabilise her heartbeat.

Doctors had delayed the procedure while Mother Teresa recovered from life-saving heart surgery last week. But she has gained strength in recent days.

"Mother Teresa's condition is quite stable now," the bulletin added. "She is looking very happy and she is blessing whoever is going to her."

Mother Teresa has been reluctant to undergo "mechanical" cardioversion, involving a weak electric shock, her doctors said.

She was given such a controlled shock in August when she was last in hospital with an irregular heartbeat.

Dr Tarun Praharaj said doctors would first try to regulate the 86-year-old nun's heart rhythm with drugs. "We will go first for pharmacological cardioversion," he said. If that failed, they would consider administering a mild shock.

Mother Teresa's heart was beating irregularly and not skipping a fixed number of beats every minute, Praharaj said. "It is regularly irregular," he said.

The 1979 Nobel peace prize winner underwent surgery on November 29 to clear two blocked coronary arteries, her third such operation in five years.

Then longstanding kidney and lung problems, coupled with her irregular heart beat, complicated her recovery.

In the last few days Mother Teresa has slowly gained strength and frequently urged doctors to let her resume her work with the ill, destitute and dying that won her the title "Saint of the Gutters".

"Everything is all right. I bless you," one clinic official quoted her as telling him on Friday.

Clinic officials said Mother Teresa was cheerful after waking on Saturday morning from a peaceful sleep. She took tea and then spoke to some of her colleagues from the Missionaries of Charity, the religious order she founded in 1948.

She strolled through the clinic's intensive care unit on Friday night, clinic official S.K. Tiwari said.

"She had a long stroll," he said. "She blessed everybody in the unit."

Doctors would have to monitor Mother Teresa closely for at least 48 hours after the cardioversion procedure, Praharaj said. She could then go safely home.

But he warned that Mother Teresa's recovery would be slow, and that she may never be as active as before.

Despite a series of health problems, Mother Teresa, who was fitted with a heart pacemaker in 1989, maintained a hectic schedule as head of her religious order and travelled widely before her latest illness.

The 4,500-odd nuns of Mother Teresa's order operate 456 charitable homes in 111 countries.
