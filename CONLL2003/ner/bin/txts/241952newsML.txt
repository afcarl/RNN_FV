NEW DELHI 1996-12-07

An Indian newspaper said on Saturday that the Textiles Ministry has authorised the export of an additional 15 million kg of cotton yarn to non-quota countries in 1996.

The additional allotment takes the total amount of cotton yarn authorised for export in calendar 1996 to 110 million kg, Business Line newspaper said.

Ministry officials could not be reached for comment.

Non-quota countries are those outside of the United States and the European Union. Exports to the United States and the EU are governed by bilateral trade agreements.

The government initially authorised the export of 80 million kg of cotton yarn, the business daily said. It authorised a second tranche of 15 million kg on November 13 after the original allotment was depleted.
