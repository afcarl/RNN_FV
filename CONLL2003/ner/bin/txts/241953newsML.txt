Mother Teresa cheerful, meets colleagues.

CALCUTTA 1996-12-07

Mother Teresa, recovering from heart surgery, was cheerful on Saturday and met members of her Roman Catholic religious order, a clinic administrator said.

"Mother Teresa is better. She is very cheerful. She had a good sleep," S.K. Tiwari, an administrator at Calcutta's B.M. Birla Heart Research Centre, told reporters.

He said the 86-year-old nun, known as the "Saint of the Gutters" for her work with the poor, the sick and dying, also met members of her Missionaries of Charity order.

Doctors said on Friday that Mother Teresa would not return home as hoped this weekend and had little chance of resuming work in the immediate future.

Mother Teresa had surgery on November 29 to clear two blocked coronary arteries. But an irregular heartbeat and lung and kidney problems have complicated her recovery.

Late on Friday, she walked through the clinic's intensive care unit, Tiwari said.

"She had a long stroll through the intensive therapy unit," he said. "She blessed everybody in the unit."
