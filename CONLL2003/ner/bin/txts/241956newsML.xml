<title>POLAND: Polish Gdansk shipyard workers scale down protest.</title>
<headline>Polish Gdansk shipyard workers scale down protest.</headline>

<p>Workers at Poland's bankrupt Gdansk shipyard agreed on Saturday to scale down a sit-in at the provincial governor's office after the government hinted it might guarantee loans to the firm, a trade union official said.</p>
<p>Jerzy Borowczak, head of the shipyard's Solidarity union, told Reuters about 100 out of 150 protesters agreed to leave the local government offices after talks that lasted through the night with the union's chairman Marian Krzaklewski.</p>
<p>He said members of the protest committee would remain in the building until Wednesday -- a deadline by which the protesters want the government to announce its decision on loan guarantees. The sit-in began two weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;If nothing happens by Wednesday we will go to Krzaklewski and then we will decide to start a nationwide protest,&quot; Borowczak said.</p>
<p>On Friday seven workers suspended a 10-day hunger strike after Treasury Minister Miroslaw Pietrewicz said the government could guarantee loans needed to build five vessels for a German shipowner if a bank agreed to finance the project.</p>
<p>The union says a loan of $120 million to $150 million, would keep part of the 5,000-strong workforce busy while the government and the yard sought an investor to save the business which has debts of more than 415 million zlotys ($148 million).</p>
<p>The shipyard's administrator, managing the company under bankruptcy laws since August, is in talks with the local Bank Gdanski on arranging a syndicated loan. But the bank has made clear that it could go only to a separate company created from part of the yard's assets and not to the whole firm.</p>
<p>The government, led by a party of former communists, has accused the yard's previous managements of negotiating bad contracts which led to large debts exceeding the group's value.</p>
<p>It has also said protests in the shipyard -- where 16 years ago Lech Walesa set up Solidarity, the then Soviet bloc's first free trade union -- deterred potential creditors and investors.</p>
<p>Unionists and opposition say that the government, which has helped other state-owned enterprises, is refusing aid for the shipyard because it is a nest of political opposition.</p>
<p>Solidarity is leading an electoral bloc which hopes to defeat the co-ruling ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) of Prime Minister Aleksander Kwasniewski in a general election due next year.</p>
