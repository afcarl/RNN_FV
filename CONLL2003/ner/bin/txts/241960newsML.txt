France, Britain in talks on disputed fishing zone.

PARIS 1996-12-07

France and Britain held talks on Friday to try to resolve a dispute over fishing rights in the Sark Box near the British Channel island of Guernsey, the French Foreign Ministry said.

"All agreed it was vital that fishing vessels in the zone act with moderation, respect the rules...and cooperate with the inspection authorities," the ministry said in a statement.

"The discussions took place in an open and positive atmosphere," it said, adding that the two sides would meet again in early January.

The dispute was triggered when Britain unilaterally withdrew from a 1994 agreement that granted fishing rights to France in the zone.

Last week, French trawlers defied the ban on their fishing in the zone but Guernsey officials avoided a confrontation by taking no action.
